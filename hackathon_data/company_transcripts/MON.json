At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr. Hurley. You may begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks a lot, Kevin, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining this earnings update and acquisition announcement. I am joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Commercial Officer; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; and additionally Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer who will join us for the Q&A period. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Tim Boeker, and Manny Cruz.","With our announcement this morning that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Climate Corporation and with the usual focus on our outlook for next year, our emphasis this morning, we\u2019ll be laying out our vision for how we plan on driving an additional leg of long-term growth.","Before we do that, let me start with a logistics, this call is being webcast, and you can access that webcast and the supporting slides including slides and information about today\u2019s acquisition announcement on monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address. We\u2019ve provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and on an ongoing business basis. Where we referred to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP measures in the slides and in the press release both of which are on the website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results, because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the Company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and today's press release.","We\u2019ll move quickly to the heart of this strategic discussion and as we do, let me underscore a very brief anchor from our year end results on Slide 14 in the financial section of the slides. We closed out fiscal year 2013 near the high end of our guidance with ongoing EPS of $4.56 and nearly $2 billion in free cash flow. Those results represent greater than 20% ongoing earnings growth and closes out our third consecutive year of strong growth.","It\u2019s also a reflection of the strength in our global portfolio as the diversity of our business drivers achieve that growth even against greater than usual variability in fiscal year 2013. Those portfolio drivers continue to have a key role in our outlook for fiscal year 2014.","So with that, let me hand it to Hugh to bring this to together in our strategic view. Hugh.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Bryan and good morning to everybody in the line. At the risk of stating the obvious, this isn't typical earnings call for Monsanto. We are talking about the outlook for the another strong year, a breakthrough addition to our company and how the mix their on our integrated farming efforts establishes a platform for the next decade.","So here is my headlines for today. As our confidence in the core business after three straight years of strong performance, we are on track for continued growth. If you set aside our acquisition for a moment, 2014 is a year where we would be talking about growth at our historical rates. That will still show through in our operational growth for the year, that performance gives us the ability to invest and break through new areas to extend our leadership and deliver the next meaningful tool for our farmer customers.","Number two. Our announcement today to acquire The Climate Corporation increases our confidence that our continued development of integrated farming systems or IFS can be a full fledged transformational platform. The first rules of IFS revolves around a single product. But with what we've just assembled, we're now talking about accrued platform with tools to span from planting receipt to many of the key variables that growers deal with throughout the growing season.","Looking to the future, growers will need every available tool to produce more yield on the same acre. Strategically, we believe we're putting the best-in-class analytical capability on the largest global agricultural footprint. The combination with Climate Corp unlocks new strategic opportunities and strengthens our growth rate over the next decade. It's a significant use of cash, that in one transaction we achieve an important leadership position that otherwise would require considerably more money and time to develop on our own.","For several years, we've talked about the convergence of biology and information in agricultural as covered in Slide 6. We see today us fulfilling our potential. We now have the tools to make farming more precise. This helps farmers manage increasing variability and meet the increasing challenges of climate change. Look at the influence of weather; nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred in the last decade.","Farmers are today are challenged to make key decisions for their farms in the face of an increasingly volatile weather conditions. Because of this, we believe there is real opportunity and value in working with farmers to manage the risks that affect them every year from planting to harvest. We won't do that single handedly. It's an opportunity that cuts across the industry and we\u2019ll use an open-source approach like the one that we've used in the past with biotech traits. That means we will prioritize building this platform as a network across all seed companies, our retail partners, equipment leaders and input providers.","This is a natural extension of our industry leadership in the same way that we invested in biotech and breeding. We believe the combination of biology and analytical capability, on Slide 7, has that same transformational potential.","The Climate Corp isn\u2019t from the traditional Ag industry, but their analytical capability and their immediate set of products set them apart in this emerging space. Importantly, they have also become the integral piece of a full platform for us. That\u2019s an important early mover advantage as we become a leader with Climate Corp in taking the big data capability used in other industries and making it relevant to agriculture. I've been able to see this technology firsthand and I\u2019m excited about what we can do to further drive yield. I\u2019ve also felt the early palpable excitement that underlies the meetings as our science teams get together and discuss how powerful our combined capability can be to our farmer customers.","So here\u2019s how we see this working, starting on Slide 8. I think this will be most intuitive to farmers. They deal with variability everyday. Every year, they make approximately 40 key decisions on every single field, each interrelated and that ultimately play out on the bottom line. However, they tell us they\u2019re looking to use more of the data coming from their fields and their tractor cabs to improve their productivity and their profitability. The bottom line is many growers are already looking at this area. They recognize there\u2019s opportunity there.","On the farms of tomorrow, we see farmers applying their data to drive nearly all of those 40 key decisions, as they fine-tune dozens of variables with the same meter-by-meter precision that we see in FieldScripts today. And since this is a technology that doesn\u2019t have the regulatory component involved in biotech or in chemistry, it moves more like the rapid cycle upgrades for computer software.","On Slide 9, we show how we see that initial product portfolio shaping up for our farmer customers. The first thing that we\u2019ll do is, build on our FieldScripts by using Climate Corp.\u2019s data insight to make those prescriptions even more powerful by overlaying historic and real-time weather information creating a better blueprint for planting.","From there, you add tools that help with planting through harvest, as well as in-season spray recommendations for pest and disease control. These help growers make better decisions field-by-field. That builds on Climate Corp\u2019s total weather insurance, a tool that gives farmers a way to supplement conventional crop insurance using predictive analytics again for every field. This is also one of the first ways that Climate Corp monetize this capability, leveraging this analytical insight to allow insurers to underwrite supplemental insurance.","It\u2019s also an important validation point as insurers have already put their dollars behind the signs and the predictive power of these tools. These tools create value, if we use the example of corn; we believe there is as many as 50 additional bushels per acre that can be unlocked through better applied data. We\u2019ve seen this proven out in our current Ground Breakers program on Slide 10.","This year, farmers planted 40,000 acres with our initial FieldScripts products. It\u2019s early days, but anecdotally, we are seeing a five to 10 bushel an acre yield advantage in line with our tests from last year. It\u2019s compelling validation that field level data directly influences productivity.","Our introductory placing for FieldsScripts for 2014 is $10 an acre, reflecting a portion of the value that we believe we\u2019re adding. And that becomes a good model for how we think about pricing and value across this technology platform. Just as we\u2019ve done with our existing technology, we will price as a per-acre fee based on the value added with each component, as we share that total value with our farmers and retailers.","As we\u2019ve shown in Slide 11, in the next two years to five years, Climate Corp. expands and accelerates the initiatives that we\u2019ve started with IFS and I expect this to be a classic example of more, better, faster. This elevates IFS as the clear new driver in our corn business, as we expect to ramp up in the next few years, first in the U.S. before expanding globally and eventually across soybeans and other crops.","In the longer-term, on Slide 12, this rewrites the addressable market opportunity; put simply our business today and our initial IFS concepts focus exclusively on where we have the seed and trait footprint. That\u2019s about 400 million acres for corn, soybeans, and cotton. The opportunity of an expanded platform is that farmers can use the key elements regardless of the seed brands that they plant, including those outside the footprint of crops that we participate in today.","Essentially then, this is a new market opportunity of more than 1 billion acres. And if you look at the collective opportunity across traditional precision agriculture and these in-season tools, we see a potential industry-wide opportunity of more than $20 billion in revenue. That\u2019s a new compelling opportunity for our business and it\u2019s also in areas where growers need the most help.","As excitement is important as our work with Climate Corp. is, it\u2019s important to emphasize that we see this as a new layer on top of the existing opportunities in our base business as seen on Slide 15.","What\u2019s driven our success in the past three years is a strong business engine. Nothing has changed in our core business and there is no hesitation that the operational growth that we anticipated for fiscal year 2014 still drivers our business in the near-term.","So in summary, we expect that core business is going to grow at mid-to-high teens operational growth rate in fiscal year 2014. On EPS level, we\u2019ll absorb some of the embedded cost that flow through our financial statements this year, as we bring Climate Corp. into our business.","That translates to an EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.20, after approximately $0.14 of total dilution related to the acquisition. The clearest way to see the 2014 growth expectations is at the operational level. For clarity, we\u2019re providing the outlook and a couple of additional elements within our financial statements that Brett and Pierre will cover in more detail.","So being no doubt, we\u2019re not taking our eye off the ball and any of the factors that drive our growth in 2014 and Climate Corp. will extend that growth in years to come. I think that\u2019s the perfect segue to Brett as he walks through more detail and how we stay focused in the growth that matters for this fiscal year. Brett?","Brett D. Begemann","Thanks, Hugh and good morning to everyone on the line. Before I jump to the operational view that Hugh mentioned, let me offer a quick perspective of how the opportunity with the Climate Corporation falls into our business view. First, this is exciting, because we\u2019ll have something we\u2019ll take to our farmer customers, so start getting them the tools, I believe they\u2019ve been asking the industry for. As I\u2019ve talked to farmers, they know that the next increment of yield is attainable on their farm. And they\u2019re looking for help and leverage in the massive amount of the data they generate, so they can unlock it to make their farming decisions more precise. As we plan to add the Climate Corporation, we have a way to do that.","Second, as Hugh said, this is expected to take our offering from being a product to a true platform. We\u2019ll plan to offer farmers a portfolio that brings something meaningful to all aspect of their operation. We will look to leverage our partnerships with retailers, equipment companies and other input providers to maximize our ability to make this a truly integrated platform for farmers.","This is an opportunity that layers on the foundation we have in a growing global business on Slide 16. So maintaining a focus on delivering the business in the near-term is critical, as it is the springboard for this next round of growth. Here is how I see the keys in 2014, in the last three years; our business engine has emerged as a balanced, global and growing operation.","In the last year, we\u2019ve removed several key uncertainties, putting our DuPont agreement in place and obtaining several key regulatory approvals and at the same time, we opened the new opportunities, the most notable of which takes off with the launch of Intacta this year.","The most notable of which takes off with the launch of Intacta this year. The things we expect to drive our business in 2014 our fundamental to who we are, it's about pricing uplift as we upgrade our portfolio, it's about the mix benefit we see with technology upgrades, it's about an increasing global opportunity and it's about our ability to grow volumes.","As Hugh said given the acquisitions dilution on the bottom-line a useful way to see this growth prove out will be on the operational lines of the P&L and as I've worked with our teams, I\u2019ve emphasized one metric in particular, margin expansion. We expect that to play out in the seed business as we expect to see margins reaccelerating across seeds and traits as we hit our growth pattern.","Given today's longer discussion on our acquisition, let me focus on the quick list of the metrics and milestones that matter in 2014. Again this year, the opportunity begins with the corn portfolio upgrade on Slide 17. We'll upgrade our corn portfolio in every major geographies with a steady stream of new higher yielding products we expect to drive consistent 5% to 10% price mix uplift.","Over the past several years, we\u2019ve been consistent in our upgrades and pricing, and that approach has resonated well with our farmer customers, as we look at this year\u2019s pricing cycle, overall commodity prices have come down from previous peaks, but we\u2019ve rolled out these upgrades in pricing with the same consistency for the northern hemisphere season, which is a major proof point and early validation of our line of sight.","If I move to Slide 18, that same upgrade cycle holds for our corn trait penetration where we\u2019re still growing in the more than 150 million corn acres in the Americas. In Latin America, the upgrades in both Brazil and Argentina are most pronounced. As we project those take another major step in the portfolio. And despite some shifting in corn acre expectations for the first season in Latin America, our trait penetration is on plan and helps drive positive financial contribution even with potentially lower acres. That opportunity is book-ended by expanding volume opportunity in key corn regions.","The best example of that is on Slide 19 with Eastern Europe, where we continue to see significant opportunity as our volume growth is moving even faster than a growing total market. As an investment in our corn growth and just as importantly as a signal of our confidence in that growth, we plan to increase our CapEx spending this year to build out seed capacity in several key corn growing geographies.","2014 also starts what we expect as the re-acceleration of soybeans as we began what I\u2019d call the decade of the soybean on Slide 20. In the U.S., the deal we struck with DuPont rewrites the landscape, as we are effectively able to reach a 100% of the market opportunity for Roundup Ready 2 Yield. And in Latin America, we\u2019re at the front edge of an even more significant upgrade as this year\u2019s launch of Intacta takes the number of royalty bearing acres from effectively zero to a market opportunity of more than a 100 million acres, that begins with Intacta, where much of the seed is already in place for this month\u2019s initial planting, supporting our largest soybean trait launch ever with around 3 million acres expected this year.","This year our dicamba-tolerant platform Roundup Ready Xtend also enters groundbreakers. So we are on the leading edge of our next blockbuster commercial platform that will be the next upgrade of this soybean portfolio. From there, our look would broaden to the overall portfolio, and in particular, the Ag Productivity business. We now have strong visibility into the year and into the ongoing market conditions for Roundup, where the strength in the overall business is carried from last year. So going into 2014, we anticipate the overall Ag Productivity business with a steady to stronger contribution, again, providing a level of confidence to another key portfolio element.","When we look back on 2014, a year from now, these are clearly the determining factors in our ability to deliver that reliable growth we see from our business engine. And as I wrap it up, let me underscore two points; first, this is a year where we are talking about one of the strongest operational growth outlooks we\u2019ve had in recent memory. We expect that will come through in our margin and our operational growth, and it\u2019s a reflection of what I see as a broader, more reliable global portfolio. And then, I see our operational growth in 2014 as a springboard. I\u2019ve visited the Climate Corporation and I\u2019ve spent time with the team. Like Hugh, I'm excited that we have something transformational as we layer our IFS platform on top of our core growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Pierre to walk you through how all of this comes together in the financials. Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Brett and good morning to everyone. Before I go any deeper into the financial review and our business outlook for the year, let me offer a quick anchor point on the key financial metrics related to the Climate Corp acquisition.","As Hugh said, we expect this deal to broaden our IFS platform, essentially moving our opportunity in our plan, and building a future growth platform. We win acquisition of this size the financial opportunities influenced and if we're able to realize our accelerated plans for the IFS growth, Climate Corp could contribute to our earnings as early as in two years. I'll cover the near-term financial impacts in more detail, with based on the opportunity Hugh scoped out we see this as a powerful investment that supports our continued growth.","As we think about that growth and our financial here is my summary, first we ended fiscal year 2013 with earnings near the high end of our most updated guidance which punctuates another year of strong growth. This demonstrates that our portfolio came together to deliver with more than the typical variability and it clearly defines our growth path for 2014.","Second our guidance reflects the business momentum and I believe that the most useful way to see it is through the operational financial metrics, specifically for gross profit, gross margins and EBITDA. This is why we have expanded our guidance to those metrics for fiscal year 2014. As we think it is important to track and the demonstrate the performance.","Finally, we also ended the year at the high end of our free cash flow guidance, generating close to $2 billion in free cash. In the past year, I've talked about how we can use that cash generation to fund growth and be more aggressive in returning some of the value we create to our owners and we've done just that and are already seeing the first benefit, as our average share count has began to come down and as a result of our buyback programs.","And while returning more cash to our shareowners, we're using our strong cash generation and our solid balance sheet to make a growth investment in the Climate Corp acquisition. Brett described the operational growth we anticipate.","Let me tell you how I look at measuring our performance in the financials, as shown on Slide 21. First we have to move up the P&L to get a clear read of the business performance outside acquisition dilution. And the first place to look at is the gross profit line where we anticipate total company gross profit to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion representing double digit year-over-year growth. And the biggest driver of that GP line is the Seeds and Genomics segment, where we expect mid-teens growth in fiscal year 2014.","A key factor in this growth is margin expansion, and I expect the historical margin expansion we are used to seeing will return, in fact we anticipate 3 points to 4 points of margin improvements across the Seeds and Genomics segment. The growth engine is one that we are most familiar with and it is our Corn business. With the core volume growth and price lift that we plan for and some of the benefits we anticipate from COGS I expect a rebound in margins in the range of 3 points.","We also anticipate a strong rebound in soybeans as we had the new royalty stream from DuPont in U.S. and as the early Intacta revenue becomes a positive contributor following a year of effectively no South American soybean contribution. Based on those, I expect total improvement in soybean margin of 6 points to 8 points for the full year.","Ultimately at the consolidated level, we expect all of these to result in mid to high-teens growth in EBITDA, which clearly demonstrates the benefit of the margin improvements coming out of our business. That business growth flow through the bottom line EPS, but will be reduced somewhat as we absorb the embedded dilution related to the Climate Corp acquisition in 2014.","Notably, there will be several upfront and acquisition related charges that flow through various lines in the financial statements, split among amortization costs, assume operating expenses, financing and employee retention programs.","That is expected to translate into EPS guidance of $5 to $5.20 after approximately $0.14 of total dilution related to the acquisition. Excluding that dilution, our growth rate would have been right at the typical mid-teens range. Part of the confidence we have in this overall business growth comes directly out of our planning process. So it helps to identify some of the key planning assumptions that underpin our guidance.","It is too early to make definitive goal on any full year factors, but within the range of assumptions we are considering, we are monitoring the potential for lesser U.S. corn acres this year and the potential for greater volatility in currency outside of the U.S. But we do balance these against the benefit we anticipate as we see corn cost of goods normalize after a significant 2013 headwind. As we consider the outlook for the year and as we have seen some shifting in earnings patterns over the past few years, it is worth outlining the outlook for the first quarter on Slide 22.","Looking at this year, I expect our Q1 to be in the same EPS range to slightly up from last year. We expect the strategic factors that reinforce our overall growth including trait mix upgrades in Latin America and the early contribution from Intacta will continue to positively impact our first quarter. Those will come along with the expected continued strength in Ag Productivity as that will also be a positive driver. But this year, we won\u2019t benefit from the positive timing associated with last year\u2019s early U.S. season and the quarter is also expected to include the effect of the widely-recognized decrease in summer acres in Latin America as well as lower acres and some timing effects related to cotton in Australia","The last piece of the financial outlook I want to cover today, is our cash deployment strategy on Slide 23. I articulated earlier in the year, that we are primarily focused on funding growth in the business with CapEx and M&A that we aim at keeping the solid balance sheet but that we are ready to use any additional cash to more aggressively fund our buyback and dividend programs.","As we look the cash strategy, I want to first highlight our fiscal year 2013 end points. With total free cash flow at near $2 billion we hit the high end of our guidance range and we nearly used 100% of this free cash flow to return cash to shareowners, through buybacks and dividends, which I see as a key proof points of that philosophy in action. In fact, in the fourth quarter we spent more than $0.5 billion on share buybacks making that the largest single quarter for buyback ever.","Shifting into 2014, I believe the elements of our approach will be even more apparent. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow in the range of $600 million to $800 million, which take into account the approximately $930 million allocated to the Climate Corporate position and a CapEx plan of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.","Within that bottom line figure there are a couple of major priorities, first we\u2019ll continue to invest in the business to support our global growth opportunities. This year we are budgeting more for CapEx and just as we did several years ago when we built our seed production capacity in the U.S. ahead of our recent growth we will finally deploy our capital to further build out our seed production capability. That will allow us to support the volume growth trends we have in core markets like the U.S. and rapidly expanding opportunities like Latin America and Eastern Europe.","These are investments that we evaluate very carefully and that offer some of the highest returns in our portfolio. You see that same growth focus in our investment in Climate Corp., this is the most significant M&A we\u2019ve had in several years and it is one that has the potential to be transformational in the growth it unlocks by making farming more precise. Practically, we will fund this acquisition with cash on hand and debt as we use the capacity of our balance sheet where we can take advantage of a favorable debt market.","Lastly, we\u2019ll build on the start we made in 2013 on share buybacks and dividends. We expect this to start to reduce share count for 2014. And in fact, we have early visibility as the share count is already lower entering the fiscal year than it was at the beginning of 2013.","Regarding dividends, we announced in August that we increased the dividend by 15%. I see these as a continuing priority as we look to align our dividend opportunity with our business growth. As we wrap up, let me emphasize that we are very focused on growth that comes on the business side in the form of the reliable funds we expect through our operational growth, but it also comes through as we put our cash work by investing in new capacity in the business and expanding our platform with today\u2019s acquisition.","And that growth is underpinned by a strong business. It is a business that is more diversified and we with a broader portfolio than ever, but it is also a business that we expect will continue to generate significant cash to enable us to fund further growth and further reward our owners. Thanks for your time.","And with that, let me turn it back to Bryan for the Q&A period.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Pierre. With that, we\u2019d now like to open the call for questions and we have Hugh, Brett, Pierre and Rob Fraley available for this Q&A period. As we typically do, I will ask that you please hold your questions to one per person, so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You\u2019re always welcome to rejoin that queue for a follow-up question.","With that, Kevin, I think we\u2019re ready to take any questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Perfect, thank you. Just throughout the entire discussion here, can you add a little more color on how the Climate Corporation fits in your existing platform, particularly with FieldScripts? And then also how long it will take to develop the optimal input algorithms across all the various inputs you are looking at through your new and existing portfolios? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Yes. Thanks for the question. So I'll say a few words and turn the mike to Rob, the great thing about this acquisition as we see applicability immediately. So they are out there in the market today they have a lot of the algorithms and the data modeling that we had looked at and literally in one step, we have an installed platform of big data's as applies to agriculture. We as you rightly said with FieldScripts, we've got about 40,000 acres that's been harvested right now and our preliminary focuses and corn, but we see what's the Climate Corp acquisition, the ability to broaden our footprint into other crops and then eventually in the crops that were not really in to today. But I'll let Rob say a few words on the agronomy of it.","Robert T. Fraley","Thanks, Hugh and yes we're quite excited about today's announcement. We've talked now for a couple of years about how the advances in biology and information technology are really creating a convergence, not only in the science of breeding and agronomy, but clearly in terms of how we think of that modeling growers decisions in the global out reach and Hugh mentioned that a farmer makes about 40 key decisions many of those decisions are very weather dependent. And importantly, this will accelerate our ability to add new scripts to our IFS platform and the other key element is the ability to move this internationally at a faster pace. So I see the building of capability and also the speed as the key drivers of this deal.","Christopher S. Parkinson \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next today is coming from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much. More questions on the weather \u2013 The Climate Corp, could you talk about how you arrived at the value for the company? Can you talk about the revenue base they have today or maybe the client base they have today?","Hugh Grant","Yes, they\u2019re still, the revenue base is still small Bob, so they\u2019re at the early stages of rolling out, there will be 1 million acres or so this year with our first products, they are touching \u2013 their first products have been some weather predictive and weather service models and also some insurance models are interest as to act in a top of basis and top of the Federal Crop Insurance program.","So we see in corn at the beginning and of course, other crops over time, tremendous leverage on taking that weather data, unfolding those algorithms directly into our FieldScripts. So just to remind people, FieldScripts this year is on a 40,000 acre Ground Breaker program and with those 160 farms, we\u2019ve transmitted scripts remotely on an iPad in the tractor cab. The iPad then sets the plants are on a variable planting basis and we are harvesting those at moment, harvest as many this year, but the early reason on that confirm our five to ten bushel projection and with Climate Corp., we see that projection strengthen in over time.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Maybe follow-up for Pierre, could you tell us how we should feather in the DuPont payments from a quarterly standpoint?","Pierre Courduroux","So this is \u2013 the payment is going to be booked twice a year and will happen in the \u2013 the first payment is going to happen in the second quarter.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Pierre Courduroux","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","","Hugh, another question on FieldScripts, how should we think about the ramp up in both volume and value over the next few years, obviously we\u2019ll seed your volume ramp ups determine biology, what\u2019s the driving factor to determine how many acres you can get on over the next few years, and you talked about this being a transformational platform, I mean what do you ultimately see as the size of this business relative to some of your seed and trait platforms?","Hugh Grant","Yes, Don, thanks for the question. So the ramp will be faster than traditional biology. We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re kind of a captive with our seed business on those first three years of slow takeoff. This is just making sure that we have the processing capability and get those algorithms refined and the deal is small and really puts the potent to the engine room in that. So from 40,000 acres, assuming that we have \u2013 that we have the results that we anticipate this year, this could be much larger, much faster. So I think it will be faster than our traditional seed ramp, Don. And then from a potential point of view, I mentioned this morning that $20 billion opportunity. We will start with our own 400 million acre footprint. I think you can move from that very quickly to the billion acre opportunity and it takes you into crops where we\u2019re not selling seed today. So I see this ultimately been on tool for growers where we can advise them in wheat and in rice and then crops, where we don't \u2013 we don't necessarily need to sell the seeds to have the advisory tool.","Robert T. Fraley","Yes, Don, this is Rob. Just again a couple of the far reaching impacts of this deal and one of things I really like about it is it, it touches almost everything we do as a company. It\u2019s really going to accelerate our breeding efforts and combining the genetic database with the field mapping will accelerate breeding. Clearly, the \u2013 bringing that weather-related predictive capability to the next set of the IFS scripts will make that more predictable. So as you know, we started out this year with our first script to address a population variability and it's gone really well so far. We\u2019ve been able to do the wireless transmission to growers. That's been very seamless. A lot of the feedback has been how well that has worked. Extending that and refining those scripts and then adding the next set of FieldScripts for disease management and extending it to other crops becomes really our target.","The last thing I like about it is it really creates a very intimate relationship to able to provide more information to help growers, and this is one of the areas where I can tell you, as I talk to farmers literally around the world, the farmer interest in this and then \u2013 and both the frustration they have with managing all the data and variables they see against the ease of execution of this platform is pretty exciting. So I expect the adoption to be pretty fast. I mean, we are working, as you know, and you\u2019ve mentioned in the talk with both equipment companies and other players and retail partners, we clearly view this as just as we did with the early days of the biotech. We\u2019re going to look at the broad partnerships, broad licensing and an open approach to optimize the benefit of the technology to farmers.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And just a clarification on value, compared to the $10 you are charging for growers next year, what is their initial charge on the million acres they\u2019re going to be on?","Bryan Hurley","","Hey, Don, this is Bryan. From a practical standpoint, they have a couple of different offerings. The first is the supplemental insurance offering that doesn\u2019t quite work like that in our traditional sense, and then they have a suite of tools that we end up rolling out from here and those kind of touch all of those in-season factors that Rob was discussing.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Bryan Hurley","They\u2019re still to launch some of the stuff, Don. So they are \u2013 they haven\u2019t rolled them on pricing some of this yet.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, very good. Thanks.","Bryan Hurley","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Cox from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Michael E. Cox \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","Thanks. I think we\u2019ve gone through a lot of this Climate Corp. On the core business, could you talk a little bit about the earnings headwind you are seeing from lower summer corn acreage in Brazil in the first quarter and if it's embedded in your guidance? And then a follow-up on the Xtend soybean offering, could you talk about any sort of update on the environmental impact study?","Brett D. Begemann","Michael, thanks for the questions. A quick word on corn, so in the U.S. \u2013 so a quick word on U.S. then a quick word on Latin America. So in the U.S., a late wet planting season and you saw as the season dragged on, some corn that just never got planted and we saw the evidence of that in our returns, so as late as, I guess, mid-September, September 16 or 17. The government announced there was about 3.5 million acres that prevent plant program. So those were acres that just never got planted, there was nothing went on that ground at all. So our book would say of the 97 million acres that\u2019s theoretically there, it\u2019s a number short of that that 3.7, 3.6 would certainly support that.","In Latin America, we are very pleased. Brett and I were there last \u2013 a week before last, very pleased with the trait penetration. So the platforms have built out very, very nicely. You see growers down there watching, they are playing wait and see relative to the U.S. market.","So last year, we had perfect market information, because the U.S. harvested so incredibly early. This year, harvests are running really late and the Brazilian and Argentinean growers are kind of playing the hedge at the moment, waiting to see what harvest looks like here. So early signs down there is acres are going to be crimped, they\u2019re going to be a bit smaller. And then Intacta and EIS Rob. Oh no Intacta, sorry, Xtend and EIS.","Robert T. Fraley","","Yes, Don. So as\u2026","Hugh Grant","It\u2019s Michael.","Robert T. Fraley","So Michael, the Xtend and EIS we\u2019re working and providing the data and information we expect that it will take about a year to complete that. Right now we are taking advantage of that time window in terms of our Ground Breakers program and providing additional opportunities for growers to see the technology if everything goes well 2015 becomes a possibility for the market launching.","Michael Cox \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","Thanks a lot.","Brett D. Begemann","This is Brett. I would just add one point to South America situation. The thing that I track with my team is the big opportunity down there is trait penetration and trait intensification and as I look at where we're at with that part of our mix we're doing really well on South America. Regardless of where the acres land I feel really good about how we're stepping up again with our traits. In Brazil we're looking at double going from 30% to 50% and in Argentina we're looking at Triple going from 40% to 60% and regardless of where acres land I feel really good about that.","And the other point that I would add and this is a point to the benefit of having a very strong global footprint in corn acres, as Hugh mentioned the South America farmers waiting to see what happens in North America and they may or may not know in times to make their planning decision down there for the first season, but we are strong in the first season, we are strong in the second season in South America and if they don't produce it down there, they will produce it in Eastern Europe and North America and we are strong in both of those markets. So throughout the year, I feel good, we\u2019ll be in the right place at the right time.","Michael Cox \u2013 Piper Jaffray","That is a good point. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Brett D. Begemann","","Good morning.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just two questions of clarification. The first is that with the acquisition of Climate Corp, the $0.14 in dilution next year, is that operational dilution or it\u2019s the combination of non-recurring acquisition charges plus operational losses, what\u2019s the clean number. And then secondly, for Pierre, do you expect Monsanto\u2019s average share count at the end of 2014 to be higher or lower than it is at the end of 2013.","Hugh Grant","Thanks. So I\u2019ll let Pierre pick up on this stuff, the same business. But let me just say a few words on guidance and how we think about it relative to this dilution, and then Pierre, maybe you can just do a bit color on the $0.14. I would say that we are \u2013 if you look at the business and it was a tough end to the year where weather conditions and the effect of planting and what we\u2019re seeing that still washing through in harvest today.","But despite we\u2019re seeing strong growth where we expected in the business and as we look into 2014 and even what\u2019s the dilution we still see good growth opportunities, in fact if you \u2013 it\u2019s no coincidence if you took the $0.14 and added it back, you got exactly our traditional growth rate of mid-to-high teens in that 13% to 17% range.","So I\u2019ll let Pierre say a few words on dilution, but without the acquisition, we have been laid in track with our mid-to-high teens growth rates. So Pierre maybe that as a back drop and how you see the $0.14?","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, looking into the $0.14 and as I mentioned, I mean you got a couple of things in the $0.14. So starting with the amortization of the acquisition itself, which would account for about a third of the $0.14 some financing cost and then a breakdown in between retention programs and operational losses as you mentioned in the first years. So that\u2019s how we build this $0.14, the aggregates of those four elements. So that was to address the first part of your question, which was regarding the $0.14.","The second part of your question, which was regarding share count, so starting the year, we are starting with a lower share count than we started the year in 2013. and as I mentioned, I mean we have the intention to be still aggressive in our buybacks during the year. So although, we don\u2019t forecast our share count for the year, I would expect on average that will be slightly lower than last year.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David I. Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Thank you. Now that all the data is in, did you gain share in U.S. corn in 2013?","Brett D. Begemann","Well, the problem is David, the day as \u2013 so harvest is, last year this time harvest was 70% to 80% done and this year, we\u2019re 65%, I think last year, 20% and today, 25%. So my view in this is, acres are going to turn out smaller, just the gorgeous irony, the business we\u2019re in with a couple quarters where the speculation was why can\u2019t to be 100 million acres. And I think with the news on this 3.5 million acres this that wasn\u2019t planted this year\u2019s crop is going to be small. We feel good in the volume, we feel good on the branded sales, but I think it\u2019s too early call, but Brett, I don\u2019t know if you have anything you\u2019d add to that.","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, I just look at the U.S. and what the USDA says is 97 million planted acres and then the USDA says that there\u2019s 3.5 million of prevent plant and those two numbers seem to contradict for me. So we don\u2019t know where the acres are, but what I can tell you is, I feel really good about our global volume. I feel really good about our branded volumes in the U.S., and regardless of where the acres finally wash out to be and we probably won\u2019t know that until close to the end of the year. I\u2019m highly confident at this point, we\u2019ll feel real good about how we landed in the U.S. this year, but until those acres finalized its pure speculation on what happened with share, but I can tell you that volume tells me, I feel real good and the returns don\u2019t concern me, because I don\u2019t believe there is 97 million acres out there. So we\u2019ll be fine.","David I. Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just on this $20 billion opportunity, is there a margin we should think about \u2013 gross or EBIT margin that could translate into earnings for you \u2013 for Monsanto down the road?","Hugh Grant","Yes, margins are going to be very pure on it, because its information driven but Pierre, you \u2013 anything you could add?","Pierre Courduroux","I mean it\u2019s obviously fairly early, but the way to think about it is once again thinking about the potential for yield improvements that those technologies can bring to the farmers and I mean we\u2019ve seen potentially up to 30% yield improvements, and if you apply the value share that we usually use with our farmer partners, I mean that\u2019s a way you can get to some kind of thinking about how we would price and that\u2019s one of the ways you can get to the $20 billion to $25 billion opportunity that we were talking about. So it\u2019s based on yield improvement, it\u2019s based on value share and then you can run the equations.","Hugh Grant","Maybe, this helps; maybe, I would think about these almost like traits, in terms of the margin opportunity and the pricing opportunity as we deliver the yields that Pierre talked about. The difference between these and traits is we think the development cycle and the regulatory cycle are going to be much, much faster. So these will come in iterative waves ways and they get smart or as time goes on. So I think you characterize them in a similar way, traits from a pricing and margin point or view, but the \u2013 to the earlier set of questions, I think that curve has the potential of running much faster.","Pierre Courduroux","And maybe the starting point from \u2013 for the thinking would be our FieldScript pricing around $10 an acre, which is the first generation of those products. So you can range it in between the $10 an acre from FieldScript and the potential 30% yield that we can reach.","David I. Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Pierre Courduroux","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","","Good morning.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe if we could just continue that last line of questioning below the GP line and just help us understand how does SG&A and R&D evolve with FieldScripts and with Climate, do you need more people, will R&D be going up, will the mix of R&D spend be changing at all?","Hugh Grant","So we\u2019re not anticipating significant change from the mix perspective. We definitely are going to invest, I mean, to support our investment in the Climate Corporation, but we already had modelled in our plan also part of the investment in IFS efforts. So it\u2019s going to be the combination of those two that are going to drive our spending and it\u2019s going to be on the people side and it\u2019s going to be on some IT resources as well that we\u2019ll have to invest into. But I am really expecting significant changes based on this position in terms of the evolutions of our ratios.","Pierre Courduroux","And then, Vincent, I\u2019d just add, the last two years Rob said \u2013 was the last \u2013 I think the last two years, we\u2019ve been going back and changing our breeding and field programs to improve the feeds into IFS. So a lot of the R&D changes that we\u2019ve made are already institutionalized. And then in my trips to meet The Climate Corp. team, I am blown away by the intellectual horsepower and the capacity of that group out there. They are a really, really fine \u2013 they are a fine team. They become the engine room for our algorithm developments and they will take a bunch of the mass and modeling in IFS and kick up to new level. And I don\u2019t \u2013 from an SG&A and R&D point of view, I don't see this as a phase shift, Vincent, I just see it as leveraging. We're spending north of $1 billion generating piles of data every year. This just leverages the data that we have much more intelligently.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, you\u2019ve done two acquisitions to get where you are today. Do you have everything you need or should we be expecting the other pieces of the puzzle to fall into place as we progress over the next year or so?","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, so you\u2019re right. These were two very important pieces. I don\u2019t \u2013 at this magnitude, it's not obvious what the next one is, but there will be continued build out in this platform, but I think between the equipment piece with precision Ag, the data piece through the Climate Corp. and the biology it holds, that\u2019s a pretty powerful triangle. And the next step for us before we see the next wave acquisitions, Vincent, is how we build out the platform with partners.","So today, we\u2019re very explicit. We would anticipate partnerships with machinery manufacturers. We would see partnerships with people in the fungicide, and insecticide, and herbicide business. So the input providers, and in particular, we see tremendous opportunities through our retail network who are specialists in plant nutrition and fertilizer, and so there has always been this question on how do you access the farmer and what\u2019s the quality of your distribution. I think this announcement today puts our distribution partners in the front row seats. So between those three pieces, that\u2019s where I see the next level activity rather than the next big deal.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Pierre Courduroux","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","So you \u2013 as you did your due diligence for Climate Corp., can you explain us the competitive landscape and weather analytics, who the competition is and why did you buy \u2013 decide to buy this company?","Hugh Grant","Yes.","","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","The second question for Rob if I may?","Hugh Grant","Please.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Is it Rob, are you thinking that the seed growth will slowdown globally in 5 years to 10 years and you needed a new avenue of growth through this acquisition, is that how you are thinking about it?","Robert T. Fraley","Thanks P.J., so I\u2019ll steal some of this thunder. We don\u2019t see that slowing down. And so why Climate Corp. and then the other question why $900 million plus and why now, we\u2019ve been looking in the space for the last three years since we started the IFS work and Climate Corp. is the best that we\u2019ve seen. They are unique in the agricultural space. In terms of the quality of the people, their early approaches to the market and their data analytics. So they represent a big data platform that\u2019s already built for agriculture and as we looked at it, our conclusion was we would if \u2013 if we try to replicate this, it would have cost us more, it would have taken us longer and we would have built it piece-by-piece.","So, this is the I think it's the entry ticket into $20 billion market opportunity and it stops fast. And when you think about our food presence today and you think what we could do with future partnerships and speed is really, really important and so that's how we look to the \u2013 and just we don't see any bigger approach is there a capability in the space and then Rob, P.J\u2019s second question on looking out..","Pierre Courduroux","Yes and I think just to hammer home on that first piece. I mean I think I haven't been at the company for a long time and watching how the integration of breeding and biotechnology changed the seed business. I think what you will see play out here is at the integration of biology and information technology is going to do the same thing. I mentioned earlier this is already changing the way we breed our crops and that feedback loop in terms of selecting new seeds, new hybrids is going to be refined. I think effectively what this would do is increase the performance of our seeds by allowing that even more refined placement for growers to optimize yield.","And then as we talked about what you and Brett mentioned in the script, many of these algorithms will benefit other brands of seed, it will benefit seed with other crops that we are not participating in today as we can bring those weather related algorithms. I can tell you again when I talk to growers, I mean the concerns around climate variability, our concerns around climate change, the affect that small changes in temperature have on everything from planting dates to disease outbreak and insects to plant nutrition are key and now the ability to model all those variables and provide growers with simple scripts that work, I think is really exciting.","Hugh Grant","Thank you. So we are going to go a lot longer, there is still quite a few people patiently within the queue. So we will go in lightening round now. So for my team here we\u2019ll make the answers faster and we\u2019ll try and crunch through a few more of these questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi, just two quick clarifications on The Climate Corp business model was reported at about charging $30 per acre or about 3% of land value, but having a weather insurance risk of about 10 times that better are you abandoning that that? And I guess the second part is that total capital invested about a $110 million. What are they doing differentially that you couldn\u2019t match their business model with a smaller investment?","Pierre Courduroux","So, we will not abandon the insurance products, we see opportunities for those products, strengthening actually in the U.S, but also in some of the international markets overtime where there is very large growers and very little insurance offerings today. So, we've been discreet, but the feedback that we've had in Brazil and Argentina is as tremendous interest in these products. So, we will maintain that but we see the opportunity is bigger than that insurance platform. And then Rob, I don\u2019t know if \u2013 again really briefly, but I think that the thing they had that we didn\u2019t is extraordinary people and the existing algorithms","Hugh Grant","Yes. Tremendous team, great analytic capability and a team that is directly focused on agriculture. And I think the key synergy that comes from this deal is combining their world-class analytics with our genetics and agronomic databases and that's really what creates a absolutely special opportunity for the company.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Connelly \u2013 I am sorry, Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Mark W. Connelly \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. I wonder if we could switch gears and talk about Argentina, the news this morning in my mind is more consistent than inconsistent, and I'm just wondering as you think about the opportunities in Argentina, do you discount them much differently than you discount the opportunities in Brazil?","Hugh Grant","","No, I'm not sure the news you\u2019re referring to this morning, but we see, if you are asking how do we see one opportunity versus other, we \u2013- in terms of the run rate, we see them both equally.","Brett D. Begemann","Okay. I think possibly, this is Brett, the news you\u2019re referring to maybe is the seed plant delay in Argentina and I look at that as just, that's part of building new capacity and we have large scale capacity in Argentina that we can leverage as well as in Chile to help out there too. So we're in good shape. As I look at Argentina, my focus is first on corn and driving our traits, I feel really, really good about that. We've got a great track record and great performance down there.","Second, I look at the most exciting opportunity that we have in the company and that's Intacta. And I've worked with Argentina for a long, long time and ever made a dime off of soybeans and we\u2019re standing in front of the largest opportunity we've ever seen for soybeans in South America across that entire 100 million acre footprint. And I couldn't be more excited about the fact that we're ready to dip our toe back into Argentina and pursue that with a product that brings tremendous value to growers. And I would say enough value to growers that they lined up and helped us get the final approvals in China to make it happen. So they know it's valuable and they want it and they've worked hard with us to put a system in place. So I'm very excited about the prospects in Argentina and Brazil.","Hugh Grant","If haven't been for Climate Corp, it would probably have been a bigger feature on the call today, but Brett and I delivered the first bag of Intacta seeds on our Brazilian farm and Northern Mato Grosso a couple weeks ago and then that the pre-launch [indiscernible] Argentina. So I think the [indiscernible] going on both of those markets.","Mark W. Connelly \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Tiberio from Miller, Tabak. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Tiberio \u2013 Miller, Tabak + Co., LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Timothy Tiberio \u2013 Miller, Tabak + Co., LLC","I guess when you look at the overall integrated farming space there is a lot of companies coming out this from different angles. Maybe if you can just sum-up very quickly what do you see as Monsanto's competitive advantage longer-term compared to some of the companies that are tacking the problem, but maybe in a more piecemeal approach? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Yes, I think your last. So thanks for the question. I think the piecemeal description I think is fair. Let's no curses in any company but everybody has been wrestling with this it\u2019s so big. I think if you begin with the grower and more backwards integrating a field level or a sub-field level and then bringing the technologies and the decisions to be here at that level of granularity. It's for unlocks we think for unlocks that increment of yield and that's never really been done properly until now. So Rob I don't know in our latent run, I don't know if you.","Robert T. Fraley","Yes, let me just add three things and I think are really unique. First of all, all of this builds on the generic knowledge and it\u2019s really unique to us that genetics of each individual, hybrid each individual, soybean or cotton variety and that really gets augmented by the ability to add to that the weather prediction to the potential of the genetics. Second thing is we have, it was mentioned, we have a large footprint to build on, in terms of seed footprint around the world and an ability to apply that agronomy to let other crops in world areas. And I think the last thing is, we\u2019re going into this and we mentioned several times, we see this has been an open architecture model. So we would see ourselves working with other input providers and retailers. and I think that\u2019s really creates the opportunity for coalescing and moving quickly with the great deal of speed. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Mark R. Gulley \u2013 BGC Financial LP","Hi, good morning, Rob. Thanks a lot for the kind of the high level view of Climate control. But I was wondering if you could break it down maybe a level. This pretends that I\u2019m the farmer and you\u2019re the sales person and maybe, if you think about how you would go through the season. What is it that you\u2019re going to be selling these over the course of the season maybe and maybe you can bridge that to \u2013 I\u2019m getting an initial benefit of 10 bushels an acre for corn now, just from the IFS, how am I going to get from 10 to 50 with additional incremental value that you\u2019re going to bring to me as the sales person.","Robert T. Fraley","Thanks, I\u2019ll do it quickly and then Brett wants to add a couple of things, because it\u2019s \u2013 I think one of the nice places to start is, there is a bit of selling involved in this, but this is really providing grower with sophisticated real-time agronomic information that really helps them in their decision-making. So the first thing that comes down to is the seed selection for that farmer field and that seed selection changes as weather changes in the spring, just like we\u2019ve seen in this spring, farmers changed varieties, they changed hybrids and that\u2019s a very weather related decision. In fact when you look at those 40 decisions that were talked about, many of those are dependent on a real-time basis on weather.","So down to the rainfall and the climatic conditions of each individual field determines what that farmer needs to be thinking about in terms of his forward decisions, win the spray to control bugs or insects, what they \u2013 what they should be thinking about in terms of micro or additional nutrition. And those are all of the factors that I think we can help them with. And importantly, they\u2019re all going to be based on our knowledge of the genetics and the ability of our seeds to respond to those climate conditions. And that\u2019s what makes it so special. Brett, maybe a couple of comments from the commercial perspective.","Brett D. Begemann","I think the \u2013 as I look at this, it changes the relationship that we have with the farmer, somewhere \u2013 if you think about how this goes forward, you sit down with the farmer, you\u2019ve got access now to this tremendous data capability to first of all recommend the product that fits the best across the field.","Then you continue to leverage that data as well as real time data that\u2019s coming in from the source of the field throughout the year from variable sources to help us Rob was describing and that\u2019s where I come back around to, I think one of the big competitive advantages here for Monsanto going forward is we see this as an open architecture, we see this as a platform that brings partners together, so that we\u2019re all working with real-time information to go farm-by-farm, field-by-field to drive the productivity of the land. There is not a farmer out there that does not recognize that there\u2019s variability in the field and they\u2019re all really excited that we are trying to help them address that variability and it\u2019s going to take all of us and that\u2019s the piece that I think will change how you represent with the farmer the opportunity that we have here.","Bryan Hurley","Kevin, this is Bryan. I realize we\u2019ve run long here, but let\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll wrap up here with one last question and then we\u2019ll turn it over to Mr. Grant just to wrap things up finally.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Yes, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Question on your soybean gross margin guidance, up 600 basis points to 800 basis points, if that puts most of the way back to where you were in 2012. Can you help us understand the components there in, in terms of how much might be cost relief versus contributions from Intacta and your royalty agreement with DuPont?","Pierre Courduroux","I mean, Kevin, you\u2019ve touched on the three key points there. I mean, that\u2019s really exactly how it plays out. So both Intacta and the agreements with DuPont provide us definitely with revenue at a extremely high level of margins because those are, in both cases, royalty flows and there is also an element of cost of goods improvement that we will enjoy in 2014 compared to 2013. So that\u2019s exactly how you get to the 6 points to 8 points.","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And a quick follow-up. When would you expect the Climate deal to become accretive, Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux","So as we said during the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got case to build this business and get it accretive as early as in two years. That\u2019s the goal we have right now.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I like to turn the floor back over the Mr. Grant for any further closing comments.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Kevin. So let me begin by thanking you for joining us on the call this morning. It\u2019s an important call, it's an important time for Monsanto, so let me just, let me conclude the two brief points. First, a point on the core business. We've confidence in our base business and if you set the acquisition aside, this is a year where we see some of the strongest growth in our key operational elements of the business. Secondly and I think this is important because we are building on that business growth with acquisition of the Climate Corp. It is an important addition it builds our IFS platform. It creates the IFS platform in the near-term and it will strengthen our growth rate over the coming decade.","So, I hope that you will join us for our Investor Day in November. We will take the opportunity during the November meeting to further highlight this unique opportunity. And I look forward to seeing you there in St. Louis. So, thanks again and all the very best.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto.","Thank you Mr. Hurley, you may begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks Christine, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining Monsanto\u2019s third quarter earnings update. I\u2019m joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Manny Cruz, Ashley Wissmann and Tim Baker.","As usual, this call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and the supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address. We\u2019re providing you today with EPS measures on both the GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are posted to our website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the Company\u2019s actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today\u2019s press release.","With our guidance update last month, we provided an early read on the factors in the quarter. So this call will be more forward-looking as we focused on growth into next year and in the next several years. Hugh will lead that with a strategic view on our growth opportunity. Brett will fill in the milestones that translate that opportunity into our 2014 operational plans and Pierre will bring this together in the translation to our current financials and guidance outlook.","Let me start by grounding the conversation in the basic financials. There is a brief of the financial results for the third quarter on slide four. As a part of our guidance update, we increased our full year outlook to $4.50 to $4.55 of ongoing EPS, reflecting greater than 20% growth for the full year. We recognize that there would be some shifting in our earnings pattern particularly in Q3 from some of the factors in play this year and the Q3 numbers reflect those trend factors we highlighted.","On going earnings for the quarter is $1.66 per share, which is slightly above our expectation in our guidance update and slightly ahead of Q3 in 2012. This quarter reflects some of the expected effects from the Brazilian soybean business, lower overall planted cotton acres and the more visible effect of the higher drought-related corn production costs. Those effects were partially offset as we saw continued strength in Ag Productivity and the practical benefit as we had the full positive effect of the discrete tax item flow through into this particular quarter.","On the cash side, through the quarter we\u2019ve generated $399 million in free cash flow compared with free cash flow of $311 million through the first nine months of 2012. That increase tracks with the improvement we\u2019ve seen in the overall business balanced against some of the growth in working capital and our conscious deployment of capital investment to support the business growth we talked about going into the year.","So with that, let me turn it to Hugh to layout how we view our growth story over the long-term.","Hugh Grant","","Thanks, Bryan and good morning to everybody on the line. As Bryan indicated, our results this quarter came in slightly ahead of our guidance update on the track with our outlook for how the year plays out in total. So the power of our conversation today probably lies less in the direct results and more and the color we see behind the numbers through the trends and how those translate to our confidence. The third quarter provides a unique view with three quarters behind us. We are close to finalizing another year of growth, but more importantly we have enough visibility in our plans and drivers to confidently begin to project the growth arc that continues in 2014 and carries for a multiple year horizon.","If I start with the reflection on fiscal year 2013 on slide five, the headline is we expect to deliver another year of 20% plus ongoing earnings growth, and that's our third in a row. That's the clear statement of growth, but it's a more profound statement on the ascension and the strength of our portfolio. Most years the results come together differently than you draw them up during planning, but that's actually been an area of strength for us this year. Our 20% plus growth comes after we have excluded the historic $0.25 of EPS from the Brazilian soybean business and work through the significant effects of the 2012 drought in corn and the pullback in planted acres in cotton.","At the same time we have a different elements and the portfolio really step up ranging from the strength of the Ag Productivity business to contribution from our international businesses, and that's what really matters. I\u2019m particularly proud of the resilience of our portfolio. Our growth is more global and it's more balanced. And because of that we now have a portfolio that can manage the practical variability inherent to agriculture better than we have been able to do so in the past.","If I broaden our prospectus to our next fiscal year, we\u2019ve reinforced the opportunity to grow mid-teens ongoing earnings again in 2014. Our confidence in making our projection at this relatively early point. It\u2019s a reflection of the continuing momentum, the underlying growth and the layers of opportunity that come together in our global portfolio.","In fact, without an inflection point, as for the visibility on these drivers isn\u2019t just about 2014, we expect to also drives growth into 2015 as well. And we are in a better position than we\u2019d been in sometime to project the growth path over multiple years as shown in slide six. In fact, we have accomplished a couple of key things this year that set the strategic course for at least the next 24 months.","First, with the approval for Intacta now in hand, it\u2019s the catalyst for unlocking a completely new wave of growth in soybeans. It\u2019s much bigger than Brazil alone and it sets up a target market opportunity across our total soybean trade portfolio of more than 200 million acres across the Americas as soybeans officially enter the multi-stack, multi-country opportunity more typically associated with corn.","Second, the agreement that we reached with DuPont in the sub-quarter rewrites the U.S. soybean opportunity for us. It also replaces a difficult relationship with a much more positive dynamics that has the potential to expand beyond soybeans.","Third our international businesses have taken center stage this year, and now reflect a significant source of strategic and financial growth. While we often get caught in the debate of acres and products in the U.S., the reality is that this year some of our strongest growth from key platforms like corn has come outside of the U.S. borders.","And finally in slide seven, we are demonstrating the early promise of some of the next generation technologies that have the potential to be the next wave of growth drivers that carry us beyond this decade.","For me, the prototype of this next generation technology is our Integrated Farming Systems or IFS. IFS, is in Ground Breakers this year and with planting, we\u2019ve already passed a breakthrough milestone. The prescriptions for more than 40,000 acres were successfully transmitted and put into action for planting this spring. That validates that data can transform to something that is time on of this planting practice, but we think it has the bigger potential to transform how we help farmers make decisions about increasing yield.","That same approach to unlocking yield is playing out on our other platforms, whether that\u2019s our trait pipeline or our new AG Biological Research. So I think this even mix of key for early R&D milestones that foreshadow ongoing growth.","Brett will walk through more of the color and milestones for these drivers, but in the near-term, the beauty of our overall strategy is it carries forward in 2014, the momentum that has driven our success this year. We\u2019ve made a conscious effort to reconnect with our customers, develop and drive products that deliver more yield and multiply our business on to a global stage.","Coupled this with the backdrop of the global need for improved productivity shown in slide eight. And, you can see that the significant opportunity for innovators like Monsanto to create a lot of value. Things like yields, acres, and prices will fluctuate from year-to-year. But structurally, the business drivers that we\u2019re focused on continue to play out for an expanded time horizon.","And I think that really underlines our core opportunity. If I summarize where we are at this third quarter, there is three points I\u2019d emphasize. First, with the conclusion of this year now in sight, we don\u2019t try to deliver a sub consecutive year of greater than 20% ongoing earnings growth. Secondly, and just as important, the significant opportunity ahead, we\u2019ve made an early or an typical declaration on the earnings growth in 2014 and that's a reflection of the moment coming out of this year and the opportunity that we see and our ability to unlock successive years of growth going forward.","It now leads to my final point, as good as I feel about this year and as confident as I feel about how 2014 sets up, what I like about our position is that we have good visibility on the critical drivers that carry Monsanto for the next several years in a row.","So with that, I\u2019ll hand the time over to Brett to walk you through in more detail the strategic business milestones that set up these new term opportunities. Brett?","Brett D. Begemann","Thank you and good morning to everyone. Let me start off today by highlighting that our renewed focus on our customers is that the core of our overall opportunity. Our success depends on the success of our farmer customers, that's why our ability to deliver better performing products and a consistent pricing strategy is so important, and when those two things are done right we see two desired business outcomes shown on slide nine.","Number one, we see volume growth. The best example of this is our global corn portfolio in which we expect to hit a third consecutive year of record total volumes. Even with the possibility that U.S. planted corn acres come in lower than initial estimates. That continues in 2014 and we expect to set another record with our global corn volumes.","And number two, we see pricing opportunity. Unlike the fact that every year we see incremental pricing opportunity backed by the fundamentals of our business, the mix upgrade is our biggest overall driver, whether that's our global germplasm portfolio or the acceleration of traits. And the consistent approach we\u2019ve taken to pricing has resonated very well with our customers. This year is a good example. We\u2019ve absorbed some additional costs associated with the effects of last year\u2019s drought and we chose not to pass that on to our customers. While this cost pressure has a short-term effect on our financials, it\u2019s the right tradeoff as it gives us the business flexibility to supply our customers and stay focused on our long-term pricing strategy. Over the last few years we\u2019ve worked hard to find the sweet spot with our pricing philosophy that allows us to remain focused on our customers and grow the business.","Now let me tell you how these key themes, pricing opportunity and volume, come together in our growth drivers for next year. We expect the biggest growth driver for Seeds & Genomics in 2014 will be the same as 2013 and that\u2019s our corn germplasm platform and the power of the global upgrade on slide 10. Every year we upgrade a significant portion of our portfolio across key geographies with the newest, highest value hybrids and going into 2014 this germplasm refresh will certainly be as important to growth as it was this year.","Coming into this year, we projected a total seed portfolio price lift in corn in the range of 5% to 10% from this refresh and that played out as planned. And while we haven\u2019t communicated specific pricing, we project that same 5% to 10% range in price lift in our corn seed portfolio for 2014. This speaks to the consistency we want to reinforce with our farmer customers. The predictable financial benefit of this annual upgrade as well as why our practical approach to pricing creates a positive lift even in a variety of commodity price environment.","The next layer of the overall corn upgrade opportunity comes as we accelerate trade penetration. If you move to slide 11, you can see that there is significant opportunity in corn across the Americas. There are approximately 150 million acres of corn in this region, and with our leading share position, the Americas provide a significant runway for upgrades.","We\u2019ve seen strong demand in the U.S. for our reduced refuge family and corn. In fact, we now project this family will come in at or above the high end of our initial range of 36 million to 38 million acres. We expect to continue to add incremental acres into that reduced refuge family next year, and we\u2019ll focus further on the compounding benefit we get through the upgrade within the family, as the highest performing, highest value products become an even bigger part of the family portfolio.","If you move south of the equator, there\u2019s nowhere in the world that can touch the pace and impact of upgrades we\u2019re seeing in Latin American corn. We\u2019re still in the early phases of the ramp up of trades in Brazil. This year VT PRO 2 reached nearly one-third of our branded portfolio, and this growth continues as we project it reaches nearly half of our portfolio next year.","In Argentina, the upgrade is through the triple stack, but the storyline is the same as Brazil. This year, we had Triple PRO on about 40% of our brands and in 2014, expect that to accelerate to roughly 60% of our portfolio. These upgrades are important and powerful in the financials, as they create significant margin lift on each acre that layers on top of our normal mix upgrade from germplasm creating an additive benefit.","As we round up the corn contribution, I\u2019d highlight the last of our fundamental growth drivers in Eastern Europe on slide 12. The corn footprint in Eastern Europe is as big as Brazil and has been expanding.","Our breeding efforts are fast tracked given that our U.S. corn germplasm fits nicely with Eastern Europe\u2019s growing conditions. And with our ability to upgrade our offerings every year and our current business investments to support this growing business, we expect this is another of the fastest growing businesses in our global portfolio. If we shift from corn to soybean, I\u2019d highlight some of the layers of growth that\u2019s start coming online in 2014 on slide 13.","With the last remaining key import approval for Intacta in hand we officially enter the decade of the soybean. As the cumulative power of our next generation soybean platform drives our financials in meaningful ways. We have three breakthrough soybean technologies to build out our commercial portfolio. Roundup Ready 2 Yield that boost yield, Intacta that should revolutionize insect control and Roundup Ready Xtend that is a whole new weed control platform. We expect these three come together as a multi billion dollar driver in the next five years.","On this slide, you see that there are $200 million acres of soybeans planted in North and South America. This year, we touched only about 20% of that massive opportunity with these next generation products, and that was exclusively in the form of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S. and just like we\u2019re seeing with the reduced family and corn. The demand for Roundup Ready 2 Yield means we will be at or above the high end of our original 39 million acre to 41 million acre range this year, and the opportunity is growing, as there are significant headroom here, and here is, how I think about how that contributes in 2014.","In the U.S., the deal we struck with DuPont completely rewrites the landscape of Roundup Ready 2 Yield. We now effectively reached a 100% of the market opportunity. As I look at the total acre fit now touching the total U.S base of around 75 million acres, that second wave ramp up begins in 2014. Just as importantly we get the first of our fixed royalty payments from DuPont in 2014, providing a reliable new licensing stream that boost our soybean portfolio contribution. Then you shift to Latin America, where we are officially on the verge of launching Intacta, the first of our new 100 million acre opportunities.","On the product side, we now have the final data from our second year of Ground Breakers, which are shown on slide 14. The second year results confirm the better than 4 bushels an acre advantage on more than 1,000 locations. That\u2019s double the number tested last year. That\u2019s created good buzz, a strong base of support from our customers and some unique pool as I believe farmers are as anxious as we are to see Intacta in commercial fields.","On the process side, with the China import approval our teams are now focused on the commercial rollout of Intacta. The approval gives us ample time to position of seed with key customers and get everything in place for our planned fiscal 2014 launch.","With the upcoming Latin American planting season in sight, we are officially targeting around 3 million acres for the launch of Intacta, which would make this not only the largest soybean trait launched today, but it will effectively double our largest previous first year opportunity.","In addition, we\u2019ve been working with our customers in Brazil and we will start rolling out official price cards soon in anticipation of our first year sales. We won\u2019t get ahead of our customer communication. We are generally speaking for 2014, our planning projects retail prices that reflect the value we\u2019ve seen to Ground Breakers and talked about for the past couple of years. It\u2019s the pricing approach that we believe gives Brazilian farmers the right opportunity to see the value of our breakthrough new technology, while simultaneously supporting the opportunity for us from our fastest ever soybean trait ramp up.","The cumulative opportunity makes our next-generation soybean platform one of our biggest growth drivers and the strategic milestones are right on track. Against the backdrop of those incremental drivers of growth, we recognize one of the elements that added to the strength of our portfolio in 2013 was our Ag Productivity business. After the challenges of the commodity cycle through 2010 Ag Productivity and the Roundup business in particular has emerged nicely and our strategy is working well.","As we approach the conclusion of this 2013 season, the market environment has held strong and our conscious efforts to layer our branded pricing on top of generics is providing some stability and added financial contribution. With the next season around the corner, our line of sight is better than it was a quarter ago, but I look at this one year at a time, and we see the Ag Productivity business in 2014 is a relatively stable contributor to the portfolio.","Let me wrap up by giving you my sense of how that portfolio comes together, and more importantly how it drives the next level of incremental growth. First, I'd say that the last few years have been important in confirming our strategy and speak to the renewed focus on our farmer customers. It\u2019s this strategy and an expanding toolkit to deliver better performing products that underpins our confidence in the future. So we won't lose sight of our farmer customers.","Second, we felt a lot of momentum in the areas of our business that matter. I think that momentum continues, creating a tailwind that I can feel throughout our organization.","And finally, we are confident because this growth is in our wheel house. It\u2019s in the areas that we know well, with the strategy our teams own and that comes through drivers we\u2019ve shown we can deliver on.","With that, let me turn it over to Pierre to walk you how all this comes together in the financials. Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux","","Thanks, Brett and good morning to everyone. Hugh and Brett talked a lot about the strategic elements that drove our growth over the last few years and that gives us confidence in further growth going forward.","I\u2019ll provide some early color on how I see this is reinforced by some key themes in the numbers for next year. Then, I\u2019ll end on how we see that growth translating into cash in guiding our strategy for cash deployments. But before I do that, let me reinforce our fiscal year 2013 guidance and use the year-to-date data to complete the financial picture of our view on the year.","I\u2019ll start with a walkthrough of our guidance on slide 15. As Hugh said, every year plays out a little differently and between factors like the exclusion of the historic Roundup Ready soybeans revenue in Brazil or the accelerated first half growth from the early U.S. season, 2013 has definitely developed in a very different way than our historical earnings pattern and that continues to be true in the third quarter where the quarterly results magnify some of these factors. So to get the best view of our performance and guidance, it\u2019s most useful to focus on the year-to-date financials.","Within the year-to-date results, I will emphasize the key drivers, starting with our global corn business. It is the biggest contributor to overall earnings in the year and it is also the one driver that we have seen contributing to growth across the board. For the year-to-date, our corn sales growth is 14%, combined with a strong outlook for corn going into the fourth quarter Latin American season that keeps us on track for mid-teens sales growth across corn for the full year.","From my perspective, seeing that consistent growth is critically important not just to delivering our numbers this year, but also for supporting our confidence in the next few years. As Brett mentioned, this year we have made some conscious investments in our customers related to our corn cost of goods and the full cost from the effect of last year\u2019s drop in our production are now reflected in our results this quarter.","So against our overall sales growth, we now have the visibility to say that we expect full year margins to pull back a couple of points from last year\u2019s levels. We absorb much of that cost, took care of our customers and still delivered our bottom line company growth. Just as importantly, these are not structural costs, as they come from the special circumstances caused by the draughts. So we expect there is some potential incremental benefit in 2014, as we return to more normalized conditions.","The strength we have seen in corn is complemented by better than expected results in that productivity and to run the business in particular. We\u2019ve seen generic glyphosate prices affirm into the second half of this year and as we stay focused on our strategy, we have managed to capture the practical upsides from this positive pricing environment.","With that expected continued contribution, we expect the full year Ag Productivity gross profit to come in above the $1.4 billion that reflected the high end of our previous range. Just as important, with the visibility we now have, we expect the contribution from this segment to stay strong going in 2014.","The other significant area to highlight from a gross profit perspective is soybeans. We have seen strong growth in the U.S. as we\u2019ve seen the mixed benefit from the upgrade on Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans. However these positive drivers offset that the effect of Roundup Ready 1 soybeans in Brazil, which was excluded from guidance earlier in the year. And you see these effect both in the year-to-date results and for the quarter as Q3 is the largest quarter where the Brazil soybean contribution historically flows through our P&L.","The fact that we were able to balance against these moving parts through our global portfolio speaks to the strength and the momentum we see in our business and with the majority of earnings in hand for the year we are targeting to deliver $7.7 billion to $7.75 billion in overall gross profit.","I will stay to the same year-to-date look as we move below the line. As we look at the SG&A and R&D spending, we expect to see positive earnings leverage for the full year, with total operating expense on track to grow year-over-year about mid-single-digits as our total sales growth outpaces spending.","In the quarter, our SG&A expenses came lower than our earlier expectation as a result of a shift in the timing of expenses, creating a timing benefit of a few cents in Q3 from SG&A.","The last key piece in the P&L comes from tax. As we enter the year, we anticipated a tax rate in the range starting at about 30%. Through the first half of the year, we\u2019ve already seen most of the benefits of the discrete tax items we anticipated coming into the year, and in Q3, we realized a significant cumulative benefit that impacts our effective tax rate.","I know expect our full year rate will come in a couple of points below our original 30% guidance as our [owing] tax benefits are now likely to be more pronounced than what we expect for in a typical year. Practically, I would also expect a more normalized rate in Q4 as well as for fiscal year 2014.","From here, we are one quarter less to close out the year. With the improved second half outlook from last month\u2019s guidance update and the final Q3 results, we expect Q4 will land relatively close to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We\u2019ll see how much of the upside in Q3 may flow through to the full year, but what\u2019s important to highlight is that Q4 is really a function of the contribution from our international corn portfolio with a strong start of a new growing season in Latin America and the expected continued contribution from Ag Productivity.","Looking into next year, here are some key themes I see in the numbers. These themes are summarized on slide 16. First, our expected growth comes on the back of our Seeds & Genomics business. With our expectation that Ag Productivity is relatively stable in FY 2014, it isn\u2019t a major factor in our growth projection. So we are really focused on driving growth from our seeds and traits engine and that is a continuation of the things we consistently do best, like creating annually mix upgrade through germplasm and trait acceleration.","Second, our growth really continues to reflect the strength of a global portfolio. Our portfolio is built on our core U.S. business and an expanded global position as the acceleration and mix benefits in growing regions like Latin America and Eastern Europe [step up] contributions.","Third, the strength of our portfolio gets compounded. Completely new growth layers start to come online next year, most notably the expanded opportunity with Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S. and Intacta in Brazil. These early trends signify more global business with more opportunities coming from a bigger portfolio than we\u2019ve ever had. And that reinforces our confidence in our financial outlook to deliver mid-teens ongoing earnings growth for fiscal year 2014, off of this higher fiscal 2013 base.","The last point I want to emphasize today is the continuing evolution of our cash strategy on slide 17. With the strong cash generation we\u2019ve seen to-date, we are on track to meet our guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow for the year. Another year of strong performance further highlights our ability as a technology company to consistently deliver strong cash flow. And with that strong cash position, we\u2019re continuing to evolve our approach to cash use.","Last quarter, I indicated we\u2019d be more aggressive in using excess cash. Practically, our cash strategy still focuses on reinvestment in the business to support our global growth opportunity, but we\u2019re also moving to use cash over and above our current levels to further prioritize our share buybacks and dividend programs. The best example of that more aggressive approach is the recent authorization by our Board of a new $2 billion three-year buyback program.","Practically, this is the first time in our Company\u2019s history where we\u2019ve doubled the size of our buyback program. Our current program was approved in June of last year. So, between what we spend for Q3, additional spending in the first month of Q4 and our expected program for the remainder of the quarter, we have accelerated the current buyback program.","Let me conclude by telling you that there are two things I take away from this third quarter. First, this quarter servers as an early capstone for the year and with an expected full-year of greater than 20% earnings growth, it confirms that the strategic elements are aligned in our business. And second, it reinforces our confidence in growth for 2014. Fiscal 2014 is a continuation of the success of our current strategy with an even stronger global portfolio.","Thanks for your time. And with that, let me now turn it back to Bryan for the Q&A period.","Bryan Hurley","","Thanks Pierre. We have Hugh, Pierre and Brett here as we open the call to your questions. As we typically do, I\u2019ll ask you, please hold your questions to one per person so we can take questions from as many people as possible. You are always welcome to rejoin the queue for the follow-up question. So Christine, I think we\u2019re ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. We will now be now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cox \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks a lot, congrats guys on a great year.","Brett D. Begemann","","Thank you.","Michael Cox \u2013 Piper Jaffray","It is somewhat early to be speaking to volume growth in corn for 2014 considering the speculation that we\u2019ll plant fewer corn acres here in North America next season. I was just wondering if you could comment on what gives you the confidence to make this statement, and perhaps is this a reflection of what you\u2019re seeing from fall orders or indications from North America?","Hugh Grant","Yeah, Mike, thanks for the question. We had a record year this year, very strong volume and a nice mix of Ag. And as I made the comment on my opening remarks, we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing and the international business as well, maybe Brett you can give a little bit more confidence going into 2014.","Brett D. Begemann","Yeah, I think as we look at 2014, it\u2019s important to step back and recognize that the global demand for corn continues to grow by a significant amount. And as we project forwards it\u2019s going to continue to take some new acres, which we look to and I mentioned in Eastern Europe. But just as importantly the strength of our portfolio as we continue to perform well and look for share opportunities around the world in our global footprint. So, between \u2013 I looked at total acres globally not country-by-country and we look at it as share contribution. We feel good about projecting 2014 growth.","Michael Cox \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. And if I could ask one quick follow-up on Intacta, given the value capture formula that you\u2019ve described historically and what seems that you are steering us towards for pricing as that rolls out. It seems that that would effectively double seed cost for growers in South American on soybeans and I would just be curious as to what your thoughts are around, any sort of pushback of that sort of magnitude of price escalation?","Pierre Courduroux","Mike, the two years, the Ground Breakers down there and this last year, we had 1000 plus farmers that used the technology. We are now very confident on our four plus sort of strong four bushel advantage of us, the older technologies wield. Brett said, we are shooting from about 3 million acres or so, we\u2019ll sell out, so the demand is high and we will place against farmer level and we\u2019re working through that farmer price level. We will price against that four bushels. But Brett, anything you'd add in terms of how growers are looking up early pricing?","Brett D. Begemann","I think the important part as you mentioned as the two years the farmers have had the opportunity to participate in Ground Breakers and when you have a 1000 growers looking at these opportunities and seeing the product performing at field, that gives us confidence that they are seeing the value and talking to their friends and neighbors about the value that they are seeing and we are in the process of pricing today and right now and we are working through that conversation with farmers, but I anticipate a very good uptick of the product.","Michael Cox \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks a lot guys.","Brett D. Begemann","Thanks for your questions.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your questions.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Thank you. Question on corn margins, Pierre, you guided that were going to be down or you\u2019d expect it to be down a couple of hundred basis points for the year as a whole. Just wondering what was the overall impact of eating that cost because clearly you had positive mix benefits upgrading in both North and South America? Is it this quarter sort of 5.6 percentage point decline that\u2019s indicative of the full impact of cost year-over-year and you expect to gain all that back and more as we go into fiscal 2014?","Hugh Grant","","Don, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll maybe ask Pierre to give you a little bit color on this. I\u2019d say, the headlines in corn despite a really tough planting season for customers, record volumes, good growth, I\u2019m delighted with the mid-teens growth that we\u2019ve seen in corn. And for us a conscious decision around consistency and maintaining consistency between years. So we saw, we ate cost this year and frankly see as an investment around customer base. So we consciously absorbed that cost with the expectation that we\u2019ll see some of that coming back as an advantage both in customer side, I mean and margin next year. Pierre, maybe you can go a little bit deep in that.","Pierre Courduroux","","Yeah, maybe to be a little more specifically, we entered the year with a number of goals regarding corn and one was to grow volume, and as Brett mentioned, during the prepared notes, we are very comfortable that we\u2019re going to be eating a record volume in corn. The second goal was to be able to price and see some price list and we\u2019ve always been talking about a 5% to 10% price sweep from a year-to-date perspective and we are squarely within that range. So we feel very good. ","So the strategy is definitely working and it\u2019s translated into the numbers where we see sales growing, by mid-teens 14% on a year-to-date basis. So feeling very good about the strategic driver and where the business is going. However, as you mentioned, Don, I mean we\u2019re seeing the impact of non-structural cost that are definitely related to last year\u2019s droughts and the impact it has on our production cost, the need for us to bring back product from South America and grow more products from South America.","But as I mentioned, those cost are non-structural. They have a disproportionate impact into Q3, as you noted. I mean we are talking about a couple of points for the full-year and you noted that you\u2019re 5% to 6% in the quarter. So this is disproportionate in Q3. This is non-structural and based on normal growing condition and looking into 2014, I\u2019d expect ample supply, I\u2019d expect the normalization of cost, and from a margin perspective, I\u2019d certainly expect a couple of points lift from where we are right now. Having said so, I mean, this is based on seed production and seed has only been in the ground for a month but we feel as I mentioned non-structural and we see the margin lift next year.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","And just a quick follow-up, you\u2019ve talked about your certainty on volume growth. So, what kind of share gain are you anticipating in U.S. corn in the 2013 season.","","Hugh Grant","We\u2019re really pleased with the volume Don and we will wait and see where the total planting acres come out. The smaller the denominator, the bigger the numerator, the better the share growth will be. But based on the number of bags that went out of the door and the performance of the crop the previous year, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about our performance, but that\u2019s still ahead of us, I think.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","","Okay, thank you.","Hugh Grant","","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.","Hugh Grant","","Hello, Frank, good morning.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Hey, good morning Hugh, hey, couple of quick questions here. Given the factor that other companies have been talking about the weather impact on their Ag chemicals business and you guys posted some pretty good results in Ag Productivity. What would you explain the delta between what you\u2019re doing and what the rest of the industry is doing there?","Pierre Courduroux","In Ag Productivity?","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Yes, on the cross section chemical side?","Hugh Grant","","Yeah, I think a piece that we saw really nice uptick in some of the international businesses especially in Latin America. And in the northern hemisphere, terrible spring conditions are very rare. So that lead to the ability, you have a lot of growers getting into the field, but when they go in their control of bigger weeds, so you see an increase in those rates as well.","So I think, it\u2019s a combination of the growth that Brett talked about in southern hemisphere and I would anticipate those rate increase was bigger, have better control weeds in the northern hemisphere with the wet spring. So we\u2019re pleased with the performance of the business both in volume and in price.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Is there any spillover effect that we can look for in terms of Ag Productivity into Q4 as well fiscal Q4?","Pierre Courduroux","","So we expect Ag Productivity to remain strong in Q4. I mean that\u2019s certainly part of our anticipation right now.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Two financial questions for Pierre, if I may. First on, free cash flow, looked like you maintained your range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. But it looked to us as though cash flow from operations was suggested lower and cash flow from investments like wise, ratcheted down somewhat. So I was wondering if you could speak to the variances in those two buckets?","And then second, if you could provide an update on your commodity hedging strategy with regard to level in duration of hedges and whether not there\u2019s been any change there?","Pierre Courduroux","So as far as the cash flow question is concerned, I mean once we are getting closer to year-end and I mean every quarter we get smarter about how we see our detailed breakdown of free cash moving forward and we\u2019ve done some corrections in the way we\u2019re looking at that. But fundamentally as we said from the beginning of the year, this year we still feel very good about our cash generation and we are also I mean based on what we\u2019ve seen in recent year, investing or forecasting to invest in working capital to rebuild some of our inventories when looking at year-end. So we\u2019ve been correcting some, that the breakdown on our free cash and we got a range which allows us to mange within this range.","We still feel very good about the cash generation coming from our business, so it\u2019s just adjustments we\u2019ve made. And as far as the cash from investment, I mean the same holds true with just we know we\u2019ve got a multi-year plan as far as our CapEx is concerned and now that we\u2019re coming closer to year-end, we are multi-sized on how it\u2019s going to play out by the end of this year. So this is why we\u2019ve been adjusting some of the variables in our free cash. So that was your first question.","Regarding hedges, we\u2019ve not changed our approach to hedges. And as far as the commodity is concerned, what we are trying to do is get to predictable levels of commodity prices when we are thinking about our cost and we\u2019re planning our hedges on a 18 months window and on a rolling window that\u2019s something we\u2019ve done for years and there is no change there in the way we\u2019re thinking about it.","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then a quick clarification if I may on tax, I think you indicated something like a more normal rate for fiscal 2014. Just to clarify, is that meant to signal approximately 30%, in other words, an increase in your tax rate year-over-year looking to 2014?","Pierre Courduroux","So, what we\u2019ve seen in this first quarter is we\u2019ve been for the resolution of a series of discrete tax items. And we\u2019re very pleased because we probably rate some of the positions we\u2019ve been taking. So, looking into next year and the fourth quarter, we are expecting a more normalized tax rate. And as you were saying Kevin, I mean, when you look at those historicals, we\u2019ve always given a range of 30% to 32%. ","We are not looking at the lower end of these range based on the confirmation we got from both discrete tax items. And what\u2019s really important to mention I think that\u2019s where your question is coming from, is when we are talking about growth next year and we are affirming our mid-teens aspiration to grow, we are not including any further benefits from tax rate getting back to normalized tax rate in our thinking right now.","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, it\u2019s exactly what I was, what I was after, it sounds like it will be a headwind for you, so that maybe you\u2019re anticipating underlying operating growth it\u2019s stronger, thanks for that.","Bryan Hurley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Maybe a week or so ago, I saw a presentation that was given down in Brazil to a bunch of growers and somebody there said, that you had about 6 billion acres of Intacta that you can potentially sell next year. So, I am guessing that\u2019s a gross number and you\u2019re whittling it down to the three by selecting through varieties. But could you talk a bit about that process and how it compares relative to what you did with Roundup 2 back in that launch year. And just give us a sense of, I know you have that slide in the deck. But if you\u2019re working on the three year, off of six how does that and you\u2019re going to be sold out this year at three, how should we be thinking about the next two years of the volume you might have and what you might be able to sell after, after this year of 3?","Hugh Grant","Vincent thanks a lot. I think you kind of answered your question with your comment on variety, so we are really pleased with the three, so I was tricky the whole bag is big, but in Brazil a piece of this production is done by multipliers, so it\u2019s less transparent than it\u2019s up here when you get through variety of selection and that sort of stuff. If you think about three, if you think of the three new contracts that run already two launched, the first few years of that when year one was 1.5 million acres, year two was 7 million acres and year three was 17 million acres. So really steep trajectory, so starting with the three or number of runs, it\u2019s a nice launch pad, but Brett maybe a few more words on production and transparency.","Brett D. Begemann","Yeah, as I think about the Intacta launch, I step back and remind that we are looking at this as a 100 million acre opportunity, not just a Brazil opportunity and it\u2019s absolutely critical that we have the best and most successful launch that we can in Brazil, and that\u2019s where our focus is on, whether it\u2019s 3 million acres or 6 million acres really financially it will be somewhat immaterial, it\u2019s all about a smooth introduction of Intacta in South America and as Hugh already mentioned, we are anticipating this to be the fastest ramp up of a biotech traits that we have ever seen and at the same time, even at three, it\u2019s 2x the largest launch we have ever had. So I am excited that we will have around three and if it ends up being more, so be it. I am more focused on a smooth launch with a trajectory to that 100 million acre opportunity.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And if I could just ask a quick follow-up to Pierre and this relates to the share repurchase. Obviously you have almost completed a program, you have announced another program, but shares have basically been flat for three years now and I guess the question I'm asking is and I know this information cannot be done with the math in the 10-K, but can you give us a sense of what you think the share creep is going to be over the next year or two, assuming the stock price roughly where it is or maybe a little higher. How much incremental share authorization do we have to offset before we\u2019re actually can see the share count go down.","Pierre Courduroux","So Vincent, as we said and I think we have to position that as part of our mid-term strategy. Our goal is to reduce share count and when you look at the first half of the year, to a certain extent we\u2019ve almost been a victim of our own success, the share price appreciation, which has accelerated some of the dilution, but when you look at the time window we're looking at which is a couple of years, our goal is definitely to reduce some of the share counts. And we don\u2019t expect dilution to accelerate actually based on where we are today and with the programs we're putting in place we are actually targeting a share count reduction.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","But no sense of what the headwind is what it would be over the next couple of years just as things rest?","Pierre Courduroux","Well we've always been talking in a normal year of dilution in the range of $300 million to $400 million and that\u2019s still what we are thinking about. Now as I said, depending obviously as you know on the stock price, this may accelerate some or slowdown, but the $300 million to $400 million is the number we're working with.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay thanks very much.","Bryan Hurley","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I was hoping you could help a little bit with the cadence of the bean business in 2014 specifically since you're going to be introducing new seed into that market, will that change the timing of payment and when you recognize revenue for seed as you bring in the Intacta. And then secondly, on the Pioneer royalty payment, how will that move across the quarters and does it show up on revenue or just as an increase stream. Thanks.","Hugh Grant","","Well, thanks for the two questions. I\u2019ll ask Pierre to give a little bit more detail. I think the way, I would think about Intacta in this first and Brett is exactly right. The focus in the first year and it\u2019s the lamenting of Ground Breakers, happy farmers is a good thing, smooth launches make for faster growth. So in terms of change in quarters, I don\u2019t think there is a material difference and not foresee it really at Intacta, the focus is getting the product into the right farmers hands in a timely basis, but Pierre quarterly shifts on Intacta and then the DuPont bookings.","Pierre Courduroux","","So we\u2019re not anticipating major changes regarding to Intacta in terms of the calendarization. I mean we\u2019re expecting, it will follow mostly the patterns we\u2019ve seen in Brazil knowing that this year, we\u2019re going to sell seed and there's not going to be revenue coming from POD. So it maybe a little more upfront loaded compared to what you traditionally have, but I am not expecting huge shifts from that perspective.","And as far as the DuPont\u2019s revenue is concerned, it will be booked twice a year, if my memory is correct, but that\u2019s something we may have to come back to you on in details. So it\u2019s going to be booked as royalty, I think twice a year, but I\u2019ll come back to you on this one.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Clearly, the good news is less of timing, it\u2019s more about thud of the soybean market that opens up for Roundup Ready 2, it\u2019s not the real headline.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley with BGC Financials. Please proceed with your questions.","Mark R. Gulley \u2013 BGC Financial LP","","Good morning. Given the emphasis on international growth, I have two questions in Brazil. One is on corn and obviously you have some ambitions there, but given the very high transportation cost and the fact that it looks like, or trying to assume well those logistics cost be addressed, farmers are just almost breaking even on corn when you factor in those rate cost? And then secondly, and kind of a follow-up, you\u2019ve had a lot of political unrest in Brazil recently, demographics there are a lot different, farmers are much more wealthy I think than in the U.S. So do you think the political unrest will change in all Ag policy as it affects your sales and your earnings in Brazil given what\u2019s happened in the last several weeks?","Hugh Grant","","Mark, two good questions, thinking that you\u2019re right, transportation is and beans can be 45 plus percent of total cost of production, but it was more and more a focus on a yield and optimizing yield on an acre and if you look at what happened in corn in Brazil in five short years, production has gone through the roof on fairly fixed acres. So it doesn\u2019t compensate for gas or distance traveled, but their leverage in the assets that they have, Brett you\u2019ve been there recently, would you add then a little?","Brett D. Begemann","","Yeah, I\u2019d just add that, keep in mind that the disproportion of volume of corn in Brazil is produced for domestic consumption and the livestock feeding industry down there and only recently have they started participating in the export market and that\u2019s not necessarily expected to grow exponentially. It\u2019s really more of the animal feeding industry growing and supplying that. At the same time, I\u2019d just reinforce the point Hugh made, that\u2019s been one of our success stories in Brazil and it\u2019s why you see the ramp of biotech trade so fast, as it helps the farmer increase yield and productivity and that puts them in a better position even with inflated cost structure to be able to compete.","Hugh Grant","","And then your second question, it\u2019s an interesting one, so there is unrest, there has been demonstrations in Brazil. I don\u2019t know if Brazilian growers are richer though, they are bigger. They are highly technified. They are really focused on production leverage. We watch the reign, we watch the relationships, though we don\u2019t see any change on Ag policy any time on any time soon. Mark, I think the advantage we have is, we have an insider in Brazil and that we are producing and selling inside the country and agriculture is a huge piece of the economy.","So I don\u2019t have any vision or anything there that would answer your question directly, but I like our position with the footprint that we have in Brazil and the presence that we have in the country. I think that that gives us a little bit of foresight.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David I. Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. You I think Brett, you touched on in multi-trait, the multi-stack opportunity in soybean beyond just South America. Can you expand on the timing and the potential of that going forward?","Hugh Grant","","Yeah, so Brett talked about the decade of the beans. We see a long runway in this, but Brett, maybe just a quick word on the pipeline and how this plays out.","Brett D. Begemann","Yeah, I think, so first of all we are fully focused on successfully launching Intacta into a 100 million acre opportunity in South America, as well as continuing the expansion of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S., so it\u2019s another significant part of that market opens up to us, but just as exiting as that near-term products that we have. I mentioned we have Roundup Ready Xtend coming which is the Roundup by dicamba trait that will be doing Ground Breakers in the U.S. working thorough the regulatory process here, and I will tell you, there is a lot of excitement at the farmer level for a new whole new weed control system that really maintains the efficiency of the Roundup Ready system and makes it simple to control, but difficult to control weeds. ","And as we look at South America, that product also has a fit, particularly in Argentina where dicamba is already registered and a little bit later in Brazil where we have to go through the chemistry, but the product fit for South America is just as strong as it is for North America.","So it becomes a 200 million acre opportunity for that product. And also in that mix we\u2019re also looking already at the second-generation of Intacta for insect control that will be part of that portfolio in South Americas. We have a really nice runway of innovation for that 200 million acre opportunity in soybeans that I\u2019m really excited about.","David I. Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And Brett just quickly, do you think you gained share in soybeans in the U.S. in this year?","Brett D. Begemann","It\u2019s a little bit like the corn situation. The farmers are just, what a tough year. Then as we sit back and look at it today, I feel really good about the success we\u2019re having with Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S., but I have no certainty yet where acres are going to land and the trade-offs that farmers have had to make between prevent plant and switching corn to soybeans and cotton.","What I would tell you, that I focus on is, we are kind of in a unique position that when a farmer changes his mind on corn, we have an opportunity with cotton and soybeans that not every everyone else enjoys and we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re getting the right hybrids there for the farmer to plant corn if he chooses corn. We\u2019ll get cotton there in the south if he wants cotton and we\u2019ll get beans there if he wants beans and at the end of the day, I feel really good about how our soybean business looks in the U.S. But we will wait and see how the acres all sort out at the end of the day to know exactly where we\u2019re at.","Bryan Hurley","Christine, this is Bryan. I realized we\u2019re running kind of short on time. Maybe we\u2019ll extend it a bit and try to squeeze in maybe three more questions here.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks very much. Did your U.S. corn volume grow this year versus last year? And are you bearing any exceptional costs for farmers now wanting shorter maturities instead of longer maturities or wanting soy instead of corn?","Hugh Grant","","Jeff, thanks for the question. So, our volumes are up this year. Every year we see those traders, and as to Brett\u2019s point, we\u2019re fortunate that we can satisfy those traders. The cost impact on that is fairly small. The advantage is you get something out in the shelf that the grower needs, and at this point, I mean there are still beans, incredibly there are still beans being planted. Being able to satisfy his second pick or his sub-choices is a really big deal and one that he doesn\u2019t forget. So, it\u2019s more an advantage than a penalty.","","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then lastly, the cash flow guidance that I think Kevin asked, was cut by $150 million sequentially, and it looks like your corn profits were sort of about $100 million lower than they might have been judging by last year\u2019s margin. So, did something happen between the last time you reported earnings and now such that these two elements are meaningfully lower than one might have expected them to be?","","Hugh Grant","","Yes, I think Pierre covered this. So I\u2019ll ask him to share a few points on how a headwind becomes a tailwind. But we produced in a drought and sold in a flood. And we consciously this year said we weren\u2019t going to jerk around on our pricing and stock through our \u2013 stop our consistency with the growers. But Pierre, maybe to Jeff\u2019s point, maybe a little bit more color?","Pierre Courduroux","","Yeah, I mean looking at the corn margin, which I think is what you\u2019re looking into right now, as I mentioned, definitely a headwind coming from the cost that we\u2019ve been, I mean, and non-structural costs that have a disproportional impact on Q3 because that\u2019s when we moved the product from South America. So, this is an investment we\u2019ve made in our customers, as I mentioned, non-structural and we are expecting this will play a positive role when looking into 2014.","And as you mentioned, I mean, the relative costs on our margins, you\u2019re talking a couple of percent and that\u2019s something that\u2019s been developing over the last quarter basically when we got closer and closer to looking at the final cost associated with this production, which once again is related to last year, very unusual conditions regarding the drought. So this is from the P&L perspective and looking into 2014, I mean, we are definitely looking into recapturing those couple of margin points we\u2019ve lost on our corn business related to that cost.","As far as free cash flow is concerned, it\u2019s more a rebalancing as I mentioned, once again in between how fast we are investing in our CapEx and also the need we have to rebuild some of our inventories looking into the end of year. So, I wouldn\u2019t read more into the free cash because free cash has not changed. It\u2019s just the balancing in between our cash from investment and cash from operation. I wouldn\u2019t read more into it than that.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thanks for taking my questions.","Hugh Grant","","Thank you.","","Bryan Hurley","","Thank you. Christine, we can probably handle those two additional questions now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Yes, thank you, good morning. I got two quick questions; one long-term, one short-term. In the long-term, there was a recent Supreme Court ruling that basically says, you cannot patent human genes, so when you take a step back and look at your business, when you are discovering genes, you\u2019re isolating them, you\u2019re inserting them and there are a lot of technical steps in between. So, what parts of this process you think are patentable and what could be potentially at risk.","Hugh Grant","","P.J. thanks for the question. So, we\u2019ve examined the ruling, we are watching this with interest and as we look our business and we look at the mid to long-term, we don\u2019t see any impact to Monsanto. So, we feel we just finish those reviews we feel very good.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, I will follow-up on that later separately, and then, secondly just quick question on the POD royalty collection system, is it ready to handle Intacta and then the split between you and the grain elevator, is that going to remain the same, because the absolute dollar level is going to go up. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Yes, I believe that the POD system is very capable of handling the launch of Intacta. We\u2019ve been in discussions with all of those participants as we worked our way towards the launching and in detail now. And as we finalize pricing and the launch of the product, we\u2019ll work through those specifics on how we are going to share within the POD system and that will be something we can talk more about when it\u2019s finalized.","Bryan Hurley","","I think Christine that puts us in good shape for our last question here.","Operator","","Our final question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thank you, looking at slide 12 on the Eastern Europe opportunity, are you number one in Eastern Europe, there was an earlier reference that you were number two overall in Europe and maybe you could talk about the transition from wheat to corn, whether that's a broader phenomenon across Europe and I don\u2019t know whether even your plans on GMO wheat in your pipeline changed in light of some of the recent wheat events, maybe just some commentary around the wheat trend in general and your share in Europe in the corn market?","Hugh Grant","Thanks, John. Brett, maybe a quick look?","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, John as you look at Eastern Europe, we\u2019re actually number two in Eastern Europe as we look at it today and as I mentioned it\u2019s growing really fast and both in acres as well as our share as we extrapolate from our U.S. corn base into that area as they match up very nicely. And to your point of wheat acres, yes that\u2019s where some of this growth is coming from. As we accelerate the yield gains in corn for an Eastern European grower, corn becomes a more profitable crop for him to grow versus wheat. And I remind you that a significant part of wheat goes into animal feed, corn becomes an easy substitute for animal feed and when you can increase the profitability of the farmer, it makes a big difference. And I don't think this is a new phenomenon. If you look at North and South Dakota in the United States, 10 years, 15 years ago is mostly wheat, and today you look across those fields, it\u2019s mostly corn and soybeans. And as I talked to our Canadian customers in Canada, they're looking at the opportunity to grow corn as well. So I think this is just a real phenomenon that is playing out.","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","","Hugh Grant","To your question John, just I\u2019m conscious of the time, we ran a little bit longer. Thanks for your questions and your support as always. As I think about the third quarter, this is a call where the quarterly numbers traditionally take a little bit of a backseat to the trends and the outlook, we very quickly look towards 2014. So let me wrap up today by summarizing just a couple of key points that are takeaway from our performance this year and how it informs our future opportunity as we look at the next two years.","So, first point, three back to back years of greater than 20% ongoing earnings growth. I think it\u2019s a clean endorsement of our strategy and the continued focus on our customers and the strength of our global portfolio and I think it fit into to finish the call, talking about Eastern Europe. Secondly, we carry these elements on to 2014, which reinforces our confidence in future growth. And thirdly, the fundamentals in our business and the fundamentals in agriculture in general take a long runway, and that means that the growth that we\u2019re talking about isn\u2019t just isolated in 2014, but we see a horizon of growth for the long-term and we look forward to sharing that progress with you in future calls. Thanks very much for today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations for Monsanto. Please go ahead, Ms. Meyer.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Boeker, Priyal Patel and Ashley Wissmann.","Our fourth quarter call provides the wrap-up of our fiscal year and importantly our views into our outlook for the coming year. Today, we will be sharing a business and strategic overview, as well as a summary of our fourth quarter results. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.","We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the Web site.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","First and foremost, let me review our fourth quarter and full year results as shown on Slide 3 and Slide 4. Our full year ongoing earnings per share of $5.73 reflects year-over-year growth of 10%, which expands to 17% growth on an ongoing currency-neutral basis. For the fourth quarter, we incurred an ongoing $0.19 loss per share, which when combined with our adjusted Q3 year-to-date ongoing earnings per share of $5.87 results in the aforementioned ongoing earnings per share of $5.73 for the full year.","The Q3 year-to-date ongoing earnings per share was adjusted retrospectively to reflect the removal of selected adjustments consistent with full-year treatment as shown on Slide 4. These adjustments did not change our as-reported results. On an as-reported basis, our earnings per share was $4.81 for the full year, reflecting $0.70 for charges related to the first phase of our restructuring actions, $0.17 for a potential settlement related to the previously disclosed SEC investigation that has been pending since 2011, as well as $0.11 for costs related to environmental and litigation settlements.","We also received a $0.06 benefit from discontinued operations. Our free cash flow for the year is $2.1 billion as compared to $959 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the absence of the Climate acquisition and the Novozymes transaction in the current fiscal year.","With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Laura and good morning to everybody on the line. As we sit at the close of fiscal year 2015, I am pleased to announce that we grew our ongoing earnings per share in a downturn in the ag cycle, more than offsetting the current macro pressures. We approached this period with focus and discipline centered on our core business. Despite weakening global currencies and commodity prices, we continue to view this as a time of opportunity, but a balance of innovation and discipline can grow our long-term competitive position. There's always the possibility of fluctuations in the short-term market conditions, but that doesn't define the overall opportunity or the continued long-term growth trends.","Innovation is still the differentiator and you need to look no farther than this year to see how it drives our underlying performance. At $5.73 of ongoing EPS, we've delivered 10% growth on an ongoing basis and 17% growth on an ongoing currency-neutral basis driven by the performance of our seed and trait technology, realized licensing opportunities, and our strong cost discipline.","Our strong cash flow and balance sheet allowed us to invest in ourselves and new opportunities, while our core business strengths and the momentum in our new growth platforms continued to build, positioning us for sustainable earnings growth over the long-term.","When you narrow the lens to the next 12 months, the industry continues to face a challenging macro environment and we've moderated our outlook. Our guidance for fiscal year 2016 of $5.10 to $5.60 of ongoing earnings per share, as shown on Slide 5, makes three key assumptions that currency headwinds persist, grower margins remain compressed, and the glyphosate pricing pressure continues.","We currently estimate ongoing EPS headwinds of $0.35 to $0.40 from currency; $0.50 to $0.85 from year-over-year ag productivity pricing declines, and $0.20 to $0.30 from elevated cost of goods for corn and the planned Xtend launch. If you set aside these factors, which sum to $1.05 to $1.55 of headwinds, what's clear is that the fundamentals of our core business are solid.","Our germplasm performance has never been better, our trait technology has continued to leap, and our market position and pipeline remain strong. However, we fully recognize that these are tough times in agriculture and we are committed to continue to drive these advantages in our core business through renewed discipline and focus.","In fiscal year 2016, in addition to continuing to execute with discipline on key milestones in our core business, we plan to do the following: begin implementation of phased restructuring actions to drive further optimization of our operating leverage longer term while remaining committed to investing in new growth platforms. The actions from this first phase are expected to lead to annual savings of $275 million to $300 million for a total expected cost of approximately $850 million to $900 million as shown on Slide 6.","And with the end of our pursuit to combine with Syngenta, we intend to take the next step in our capital allocation strategy with a new $3 billion accelerated share repurchase program as we progress towards our targeted capital structure. We expect to begin the accelerated share repurchase in the near term with plans to complete it sometime in the next six months. These actions are designed to compound our underlying future growth, and when combined with growth in the core business and the new platforms, continue to underpin our confidence to meet our goal of more than doubling our fiscal year 2014 ongoing EPS by fiscal year 2019, which begins with an estimated 20% plus ongoing EPS growth starting in fiscal year 2017.","The primary drivers of the revised plan, as shown on Slide 7, includes an expected return to mid-single digit corn and germplasm mix lift globally and what we see as a modestly improved commodity corn price environment beginning in fiscal year 2017.","We also expect Intacta penetration in roughly three quarters of the 100 million acre opportunity and Xtend's technology at about two-thirds of the U.S. soybean acres. The absence of several negatives from this coming year, including elevated corn COGS and the Xtend launch costs, are expected to further enhance this growth, while genetic glyphosate prices are expected to make a small, but steady recovery over this time.","Spend is expected to be moderated by the success of the restructuring actions and with our long-term targeted net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio of 1.5, we expect share repurchases to account for a portion of the planned ongoing EPS growth through fiscal year 2019. The confidence in our outlook is further underscored by the fundamentals of agriculture, which remain compelling. Obviously, the current oversupply situation has created continued near-term pressure on commodity prices so far unwavering of the demand curves as shown on Slide 8. Macro demand remains robust. In fact, the world is consuming the current oversupply at a record pace with demand for corn growing by an average of 1.3 billion bushels per year over the past three years. More than 90% of this growth in demand over this timeframe has been driven by feed and underpinned by middle-class protein consumption, which we expect to continue.","As we look out with conservative assumptions, we continue to plan for annual average demand growth in corn of approximately 500 million bushels and 200 million to 250 million bushels in soybeans. With this level of demand and yields at trendline, we expect the global corn supply to use ratio to return to a range supporting the corn commodity price improvements into 2017 and beyond. And if you look at the demand trendline from the last three years, the world would need to double the annual rate of yield increases to nearly 3%, or 2 times our forecasted estimates to satisfy this demand.","With the agricultural area of expansion effectively constrained, the majority of this increase will need to come from yield and it needs to be delivered in the face of the challenges presented by climate change making yield and innovation even more critical as we look forward.","As the innovation leader, we are aligned to these trends and we are accelerating our vision to create value through a truly integrated ecosystem for agriculture, as shown on Slide 9. Our competitive advantage leverages the know-how that we've assembled across our industry-leading capabilities in breeding, biotechnology, digital ag, next-generation biologicals and crop protection solutions. The proposed combination with Syngenta would have been complementary to our vision, but now we move confidently forward with our leading position in seeds and digital agriculture to pursue other options to build on our existing crop protection portfolio and in our partnerships. We have a multi-pronged approach to our crop protection strategy that includes organic growth from products in our pipeline and in our collaborations, as well as growth from targeted partnerships to access molecules and opportunistic M&A.","Longer term, we expect new layers of growth to come from VaporGrip formulations of dicamba, our nematicide and the BioAg alliance. Despite near-term industry turbulence we are at the eve of rapidly expanding opportunities for our company. The growth drivers in our core business are reaching critical milestones and the potential value of digital ag is becoming ever more tangible. With our current core business opportunities and the step-change in progress in our new growth platforms, today, we preview our line of sight on the next decade of technology upgrades, as shown on Slide 10.","As we look out to 2025, we see the opportunity for more than 800 million acres of new technology upgrades. And that's a commercial opportunity with technologies that are largely in hand and are core platforms alone. We expect to have first and second-generation Intacta upgrades in South America, Xtend penetration across the Americas, a new nematicide and technology upgrades across the our global corn franchise to drive acreage upgrades. With our new growth platforms, we expect broad acre adoption of microbials and Climate to provide significant upside potential to these core technology upgrades. We look forward to further building out these key commercial growth drivers and providing the early yield data proof points at our upcoming November biannual investor event here in St. Louis.","So while it is easy to get bogged down in the transitory macro factors that are weighing on global agriculture today, if you take a longer view, you can see that we have the opportunity to lead the next evolution in agriculture, not unlike the transformation that we led in biotech and in breeding.","Now is the time to be discussing transformative opportunities as it's precisely in challenging times that strategic advancements, along with key operational discipline, can foster new growth. So while fully recognizing the current market realities, we are staying focused on near-term execution in our core business while at the same time advancing and expanding our new platforms.","So with that, I will turn it over to Brett to walk you through the operational milestones and the outlook for next year that supports these plans. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thanks, Hugh and good morning to everyone on the line.","As we build our operational plans for 2016, discipline becomes increasingly important. In ag productivity, that discipline is about staying consistent with our strategy to maintain a small premium over generics and we have lowered prices accordingly. While this creates a tough comparison versus last year, we expect 2016 to provide a solid base for the business long-term with new differentiated formulations from dicamba driving growth from that base over the coming decade.","Slide 11 highlights the core assumptions that support an expected gross profit contribution in the ag productivity segment ranging from $900 million to $1.1 billion, which remains an important strategic fit with our seeds and traits franchise. Our discipline also shows up in our continued cost management and the execution of the initial phase of our restructuring actions. We plan to implement global commercial hubs and we'll further develop our global R&D center of excellence in St. Louis, all of which will focus resources and drive efficiencies.","We also plan to modernize and optimize our IT and supply chain networks and accelerate the use of data and analytics to dramatically improve our field testing and product development cycle.","Finally, we plan to further streamline and reprioritize some of our commercial-enabling and R&D efforts, which include the exit of the sugarcane business and streamlining of the yield and stress program approach. When complete, we believe these actions will enable us to be more agile, focused and cost effective in delivering on long-term growth objectives. This discipline will be foundational to our performance in the next era where success will be driven by continued innovation, integrated solutions and improved insights our customers seek.","Let's walk through the milestones in fiscal year 2015 and the key deliverables for 2016 that position us for near-term rapid growth beginning in fiscal year 2017. Let's start with corn, as shown on Slide 12. We have seen the most significant decline in farmer incomes in a decade and yet our corn franchise has been a source of relative stability and durability as compared to other inputs in the industry. And importantly, our key metrics for customer relationships have never been better.","Near term, the horsepower of our global corn business centers on our continuous breeding upgrades to propel pricing and share growth. Even in 2015, we saw farmers continue to migrate to the newer classes of genetics, delivering a positive global mix lift in local currency. In the U.S. alone, nearly 40% of our sales were in year-one and year-two hybrids. Continuing this trend, we expect low single-digit germplasm price mix lift in local currency again in fiscal year 2016. This considers new hybrids at a premium, plus small declines we took in some of our mid-tiers in the U.S. corn seed business in order to ensure we are maintaining a robust ladder of offerings in our portfolio.","Beyond fiscal year 2016, we expect commodity prices to lift to $4.50 plus and this trend, when paired with the continued demand for new hybrids, is expected to lead to mid-single digit lift in corn germplasm mix. The early estimates on corn acres point to a likely 20% or more decline in Argentina and in the Brazil summer season. However, we expect a U.S. and Brazil safrinha corn acres to be up modestly with the U.S. acreage increase coming at the expense of soybean acres.","Regarding share, we held or grew share in every major market in 2015 and are seeing significant momentum with our license base in both the U.S. and Brazil, as shown on Slide 13. We expect to repeat this share performance in 2016 and the early read on the U.S. branded corn yield data suggests that we have held or expanded our yield advantage for the 10th consecutive year. With the near-term commodity price rebound we expect in 2017, we anticipate significant growth as price, mix and share often grow collectively. And as we look out, we expect to refresh the hybrids in our 75 million acre plus branded seed base nearly 2x in that next decade. That, along with the continued momentum and global share growth and new trade upgrade opportunities, is expected to provide roughly 240 million acres of technology, corn seed and trade upgrades over the next decade.","Let's move to soybeans next where Intacta is setting records with a 15 million acre penetration this past year and a target of 30 million acres in just its third year of commercialization, as shown on Slide 14. Our order books are reflecting tremendous demand. In fact, in Brazil, prepays are tracking ahead of forecasts and we are receiving great feedback from our licensed seed partners who, together with our brand, cover approximately 90% of the market. We did raise our price in Brazil in the mid-single digit range in local currency, partially offsetting some of the currency headwinds. However, penetration and grower experience remains our primary objective.","In addition, our second-generation Intacta product continues to progress nicely and is expected to launch before the end of the decade in this 100 million acre opportunity. Finally, our point-of-delivery business model is now up and running in northern Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, unlocking the opportunity for future soybean technologies in the region.","The other near-term blockbuster soybean technology is our Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, which will enhance the strength of our current Roundup Ready system with dicamba tolerance. We now see this as a 250 million acre opportunity across the Americas that extends beyond the soybeans and cotton to encompass corn given the progress we see in our pipeline. We expect this technology to ramp even faster than Intacta and our U.S. teams are gearing up for the largest technology launch ever, more than 3 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in fiscal year 2016 as shown on Slide 15.","We recently rolled pricing and are now planning for a launch that includes more than 70 unique soybean varieties across our branded and licensed footprint. Based on the value creation demonstrated, we have priced the new Xtend varieties at roughly $5 to $10 per acre premium over Roundup Ready 2 Yield varieties. This level of incremental value creation continues to reinforce Xtend as one of the leading core business growth drivers. Given the overwhelming demand from farmers, dealers and licensees, we've implemented a pre-order reservation process in advance of the final regulatory milestones and based on current tracking, we expect the seed to be fully reserved by early December.","We continue to progress with key regulatory agencies in the U.S. and China and have been working closely with our channel partners in our planning process. While the launch does not create financial value in the first year, it does mark an important milestone for significant future growth.","On a related note, our Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is expected to double its 2015 penetration with plans to reach 1.5 million acres in fiscal year 2016. As a key complement to this system, we continue our planning for the potential dicamba investment at our Luling plant to ensure that there is sufficient supply in a market that is expected to add 250 million acres of opportunity in the next decade, as shown on Slide 16. Our current expectation is that our investment in the dicamba manufacturing capacity would ultimately service approximately 25% to 35% of the fully mature market and would provide a double-digit return on investment from the incremental dicamba sales.","Further, our recent investment in dicamba VaporGrip formulation capacity is expected to allow us to offer easy-to-use, proprietary formulations for growers and near-term licensing opportunities.","Moving to digital ag, the Climate Corporation has emerged as the digital ag platform with leading data science capabilities and broad scale industry partners. In fiscal year 2015, more than 75 million acres were enrolled on the platform and more than 5 million subscribed to our premium offerings, as shown on Slide 17, confirming a step-change in product performance with adoption that exceeded even our aggressive targets.","As we look forward to 2016, we now expect the Climate platform to expand to more than 90 million acres with over 12 million in our paid offerings as we expand our geographic reach for the premium services by nearly 2.5x our fiscal year 2015 acres. As a testament to the step-change in performance, I am pleased to share a sampling of the results our early adopters experienced through the use of our premium Climate services as shown on Slide 18.","Our Nitrogen Advisor is dramatically changing how our customers manage their nitrogen applications and the results from these on-farm strip trials clearly show the value of the recommended additional applications from our advisor. And through advanced satellite imagery, our Field Health Advisor consistently diagnosed emerging issues in the field, which helps reduce costs and improve overall productivity on the farm.","As we look at the next decade for digital agriculture, one thing is clear. This platform will change the way farmers manage their operation; it will change who we are as a company; and it will transform the industry. In fact, we are targeting expansion of the platform into new crops in the next three to five years, including, but not limited to, soybeans, wheat and canola. And geographically, we have trials planned for Brazil in 2016 and expect to be in additional geographies by the end of the decade.","In summary, we are focused on disciplined execution of the key deliverables across our core business to unlock the growth to our fiscal year 2019 ongoing EPS growth targets and to greater than 800 million acres of core technology upgrades we see over the course of the next decade. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we have the drivers in hand to propel growth over the next decade.","With that, I will pass it to Pierre to provide the financial outlook.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Brett and good morning to everyone on the line.","Let me start by giving you the highlights of our FY 2015 performance. First, the fundamental drivers of our core seed and genomic business are sound and remain a source of durability, generating roughly $250 million in gross profit growth in fiscal year 2015, exclusive of currency headwinds of roughly $250 million, acreage headwinds of $255 million in corn, cotton and soybeans and $100 million of restructuring charges. This performance was driven by our accelerating soybean business, by overall positive corn germplasm price mix benefit in local currency and by branded and licensed share footprint expansion.","Second, [Intacta] [ph] productivity, we stay true to our glyphosate pricing strategy and effectively unlocked value in our lawn and garden brand for the Scott's licensing agreements to partially offset nearly $350 million of gross profit headwinds from generic glyphosate pricing and currency.","Third, our disciplined approach is highlighted by the significant improvement in operating expense leverage with ongoing operating expenses down 8% year-to-year.","Fourth, we've leveraged our strong balance sheet and cash generation with free cash flow coming in at $2.1 billion and made significant progress in our capital allocation strategy. With the successful completion of our $6 billion accelerated share buyback program, we've repurchased more than 10% of our share outstanding since June of 2014.","Our share count now stands at 468 million shares and our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio sits at 1.1 at the close of the fiscal year.","Taken together, this strong underlying business performance, amplified by our disciplined approach and capital allocation strategy, drove 17% growth in ongoing currency-neutral EPS for the fiscal year.","As we look forward into fiscal year 2016, that same focus on converting core operational strength into financial performance through discipline and execution and the continued implementation of our capital allocation strategy remains a priority. As shown on Slide 19, our ongoing earnings guidance range of $5.10 to $5.60 reflects the headwinds created by the year-over-year decline in foreign currencies and generic glyphosate pricing.","In FY 2016, we anticipate those headwinds to more than offset the benefits from the growth in our seeds and genomic gross profits, from our planned near-term $3 billion accelerated share repurchase program and from the first phase of our restructuring actions. Assuming major currency rates remain relatively consistent with today's rate and the ratio of Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar remains in the mid to high 3s, we expect a $0.35 to $0.40 currency headwind in FY 2016.","We anticipate the decline in ag productivity pricing to drive another $0.50 to $0.85 of expected headwinds as we project the ag productivity segment gross profit to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This gross profit projection assumes that genomic prices improve some over the course of the year as we believe competitive pricing will move to a more sustainable level in the market.","And while the $274 million gross profit benefit we received from the Scott's licensing agreement was a one-time event in 2015, we do expect to benefit from other licensing and sales arrangements of a similar order of magnitude, likely in our seeds and genomic segment towards the end of fiscal year 2016. SmartStax PRO and over current and pipeline products are generating significant interest and we expect some to culminate in the next year.","So while it is important to clearly outline and plan for the expected macroeconomic challenges, it is even more relevant to outline the growth drivers in our plans and highlight their expected financial contribution in fiscal year 2016. We are anticipating mid-to-high single digit percentage growth in gross profit from our core seeds and genomic segments before estimating restructuring charges and including licensing opportunities. And this is a critical milestone to delivering growth longer term.","In corn, the key growth drivers are expected low single-digit germplasm price mix lift in local currency, share growth with some improvement in corn acres and corn cost saving initiatives. These are expected to more than offset the $90 million to $100 million penalty we expect in corn cost of goods related to our scaled-back production plans driven by the reduction in corn acres over the past two years.","In soybeans, momentum across the Americas continues to build in the next fiscal year. In South America, Intacta is expected to double to 30 million acres, but currency dampens the expected gross profit growth as a significant movement in the Brazilian real occurred mid-season. We do revisit the key value drivers when setting our price early in the calendar year. However, in the case of Intacta, our negotiated grow license agreements cap the annual price increases to inflationary levels for the FY 2017.","In North America, the excitement for the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend launch continues to grow as we target more than 3 million acres with the new Xtend varieties priced at $5 to $10 per acre premium. In FY 2016, there are, however, expected launch costs of $70 million to $80 million that more than offset those revenues. These launch costs include expense for a technology license plus pre-foundation seeds and storage costs. These launch costs are expected to scale down to closer to $50 million by the third year of commercialization as we move to a more historical level of trade margins.","We anticipate total FY 2016 operating expenses, excluding these estimated restructuring charges, to be up 2% to 4% as compared to FY 2015 ongoing operating expenses. The $100 million plus of first-year operating expense savings from our restructuring actions are not expected to fully offset the increases from inflation and investment in growth platforms in fiscal 2016. But with some of the benefits of our 2015 discipline spend management carrying into fiscal year 2016, total [exporating] [ph] expenses, again before estimated restructuring charges, are still expected to be more than $200 million lower than our FY 2014 ongoing operating expenses.","By the end of FY 2017, we expect the first phase of our restructuring actions to deliver an estimated $275 million to $300 million savings across our P&L. All-in costs for the first phase of the restructuring action is expected to be approximately $850 million to $900 million with about $450 million of those being pretax cash costs.","Our supplemental restructuring phase is expected to target an additional $100 million of cost savings by the end of FY 2018. Given that we are still in the early days of developing those actions, the associated costs for the supplemental phase are not sustainable and are not considered in our FY 2016 guidance.","Finally, the anticipated tax rate for the coming year is expected to be in the range of 25% to 27% and net financing expense is expected to reflect the increases in interest expense arising from the incremental debt incurred as we move towards our leverage target.","Within the components of our FY 2016 guidance, today, we have announced our plans to advance our capital allocation strategy with a $3 billion accelerated share buyback program. We expect to fund these repurchases with cash and short-term borrowings. The execution of our plan should opportunistically take us to a net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio in the range of 1.7, modestly above our target of 1.5 at the close of FY 2016, as shown on Slide 20.","All together, we expect the net effect of reduced share counts and increased net financing expense to provide $0.24 to $0.27 of FY 2016 ongoing earnings-per-share growth. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balanced between continued share repurchases, dividends, capital investments and investments in technology. This should allow us to operate with flexibility to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy while remaining committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating to allow access to commercial paper.","Backing this capital allocation strategy is our ability to convert earnings into strong cash generation. We plan to generate $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year 2016 with the opportunity to grow this in future years absent the approximately $200 million to $250 million of after-tax restructuring cash costs we expect to incur in FY 2016.","Cash flows from operations are expected to be $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion while cash flows used for investing activities are expected to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, inclusive of the initial potential investment in the dicamba plant.","The final point I'd like to cover is the expected earnings flow. Currencies and generic glyphosate prices moved primarily after the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 and when combined with the expected pullback in corn acres in Brazil's summer and in Argentina, we are anticipating the first quarter ongoing earnings to be down in the range of $0.70 to $0.80 versus the prior year before considering $0.30 to $0.40 of expected restructuring charges in the first quarter.","That being said, a portion of this decline is expected to be made up in the second half of the year with the outlook for Q2 earnings expected to be relatively flat with the prior year. There is no doubt that fiscal year 2016 will be a tough year across the industry and in this environment, financial discipline will be critical. However, we remain committed to invest in our business in a disciplined manner to enable longer-term growth.","As CFO, my focus is on financial discipline to support long-term growth and strong translation of that growth into free cash that in turn will support future growth investments and return value to our shareowners. These priorities show up in our financial results for the year and in our future outlook.","Continuing to execute well on these pillars will provide the gateway to the rapid future business growth necessary to deliver on our plan to more than double our ongoing FY 2014 EPS by 2019 and to deliver our tremendous long-term opportunity to upgrade core technologies across more than 800 million acres over the course of the next decade with upside potential from our new growth platforms.","Thanks and I will turn it back over to Laura for the Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks, Pierre. With that, we'd now like to open the call for questions. In addition to Hugh, Pierre, and Brett, we also have Dr. Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer joining us for Q&A. As we typically do, I will ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You are always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up.","Kevin, I think we are ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Don Carson from Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Thank you. Yes, a question on the outlook for digital agriculture. You talk about Climate Corp. and others making a meaningful contribution by 2019. How meaningful is that in absolute dollars and what has been the gross spend on Climate Corp. and other initiatives both in fiscal 2015 and what you are anticipating in 2016?","Hugh Grant","So, Pierre, maybe a word on our differential spend and how we are investing in this?","Pierre Courduroux","Sure. So Don, when we are talking about meaningful contribution, at the GP level, and that's what we've been sharing, we are talking about several hundred million dollars as an order of magnitude. Obviously, we will keep you updated as the years evolve, but that's what we are thinking about and that's what the teams have been building their plan around.","Concerning the investments in FY 2015 and in FY 2016, in FY 2015, definitely, we have continued to invest more than we did the previous year, but not as much as what we originally planned. That was part of the financial discipline we were talking about. We've invested in between I mean $50 million and $100 million more than the previous year in those platforms, and that's kind of the way we are thinking about it next year when entering into FY 2016. So continuing definitely to invest, but with the financial discipline and there's obviously room for adjustments as the business evolves.","Don Carson","Okay. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple of quick ones. On Intacta, the price when you launched the product included in that contractual agreement that there would be a step-up automatically in fiscal 2018. Is that the case still? Has anything changed there and is it possible to raise the price above what's in the contract?","Hugh Grant","Vincent, thanks for the question. You will remember, when we launched Intacta, we were negotiating with growers in Brazil. So this was a function of those negotiations -- but, Brett, the step-up opportunity post 2017?","Brett Begemann","Yes, so as part of those negotiations, as Hugh was describing, we agreed that increases in price through 2017 could only be in the range of inflation. So as we look to post 2017, we will have the opportunity to reevaluate the value creation in the marketplace, look at pricing. We won't have the constraint of that limit and there will also be rebates that disappear in that post-2017 timeframe as well, so that gives us even a greater confidence in Intacta growth and how it starts to drive our business. And then right behind Intacta, don't forget the importance of Intacta II that's coming right along behind that. That allows us another opportunity for demonstrating value in the market and seeing that show up in price.","Vincent Andrews","Could you just clarify, on the seeds and traits gross profit growth, Pierre, you mentioned that there were going to be license agreements and you sort of compare them to the ones in ag productivity last year? So are you expecting license agreements to be of a one-time nature again or is this going to be ongoing?","Pierre Courduroux","So Vincent, those agreements are by nature one-timers, but what you have -- I mean to remember is, over time, I mean our strategic teams have always been working -- and that's part of the nature of our business to look at those as almost ongoing one-timers because we've got, as you know, a number of discussions with our partners and potential partners around a number of our technology, some of our non-core assets. So this is always what we've been doing and what we are envisioning to do in the future as well.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect. Thank you. Can you just walk us through the long-term cadence of the glyphosate gross profit and potentially parse out pricing expectations going forward, FX and also OpEx? And really just how to bridge from the new starting point out of -- from the $900 million to $1.1 billion back up significantly to the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion? So any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Chris, and I'll maybe ask Pierre to say a few words on our assumptions, but I would say that a lot of the pricing as you look at our projections in 2016, and I hope this came through in the prepared remarks, our pricing moves are already made. So I think we've taken a pretty conservative view. I know everybody is looking at glyphosate price everyday in their Bloomberg screens. So we are not calling the bottom in this, but we've made -- when we give you this projection for 2016 today, we've made we think the pricing moves that address this opportunity, but maybe a word on cadence and the fact we sell out as well, Pierre.","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, so what's important to understand when we are looking at the next five years is although glyphosate remains a critical part of our portfolio and we are actually expecting some level of rebound in pricing in glyphosate over the next couple of years, it's not the only driver and it's not by far the only driver within the growth we are projecting in our ag productivity segments. Remember we will start to enter in dicamba from a commercialization perspective from a chemical side.","We have our APS -- so APS -- we continue to commercialize third party chemistries, so it's really more those supporting chemistries that are going to drive the growth in addition to a small rebound in glyphosate. So we've not ranged the glyphosate profile.","As Hugh was saying, I mean -- we wouldn't call necessarily the bottom from a price perspective, but we are expecting that, over time, we will see some level of rebounding glyphosate pricing and the key driver for that is, based on our calculation, based on our estimates, right now, most of the China producers would be selling below cost, and we don't believe this is sustainable. I mean it may last for a couple of months, but we certainly don't believe this is what drives the rationale.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar","Given how quickly the situation sort of worsened in Brazil and the ongoing [indiscernible] in glyphosate. I am wondering why do you expect EPS to start growing at 20% starting in 2017? And maybe we are at the bottom when we begin to grow, but what do you think are the key risks in that scenario?","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the question, P.J. It was very politely put. So the reason that we feel that 2017 is a rebound or a slingshot, or we get back on that growth curve, on first blush, it might seem ambitious. If you look at our growth this year minus currency, we tongued in a 17% growth this year. To Brett's point, we grew or held share in every one of our key markets around the world, so when you look at a somewhat anticipated normalization in currency, the drawdown on ending stocks, the velocity in that and then, Pierre, maybe the three or four big drivers that kind of make up the 20% growth?","Pierre Courduroux","So, P.J., maybe the best way to think about it is, when you look at the key driver of this growth and this rebound in 2017, definitely starting from the assumption that, by 2017, we will see corn pricing get back to this $4.50 level and if you look at the futures for December 2016, I mean they look much better than they did a couple of weeks ago. So this is really something that's driving our thinking. And on top of that, then you've got a couple of Monsanto-specific drivers.","So first of all, and I think we've been pretty clear about those. I mean we've had some cost of goods penalties over the last two years based on the production volumes we've been seeing, based on the Xtend launch costs that we are going to incur this year that are not going to happen going forward in 2017. So when you look at 2017, about 25% of that growth is really going to be coming from the absence of those cost of good penalties, so that's the starting building block. Then you have the core growth and we are very bullish about Intacta that we see with the potential to grow another 15 million to 20 million acres.","We are also very bullish about Xtend. So this year, we will have a 3 million acre, which will be the largest launch we are doing and we see by 2019 the potential for that product to be on more than 50 million acres. So if you extrapolate that and try to draw the curves with what we've seen in Intacta and potentially faster, that's also one of the key drivers of the way we are thinking about soybeans.","And then corn, I mean, we have this year to make a couple of adjustments in our pricing and based on the commodity price environment, we've been prudent in the way we are pricing. But when you look back -- when you look forward, sorry -- into 2017, we definitely see the potential to get back to our mid to -- mid-single digit pricing increases on our germplasm base, which by then will be a fairly significant upside.","And then also you always see the share increases that we've seen. Even in the tough year this year, we are in a position where, based on what we have today, we do believe we've grown or maintained share in all the key markets around the world. So we also see very nice momentum there. So when you look at that and you add the modest growth we are expecting from the veggies and the cotton businesses, I mean that's why our core business we can see driving growth.","And in addition to that, obviously, there is the financial discipline. When we built our plans last year, we were a little more aggressive in how much and how fast we were going to invest. We will be very disciplined about that and I think that the actions we are taking this year in terms of restructuring are demonstrating that we are committed to be very disciplined in terms of costs and of course, there's also -- I mean we are making a big step today I think in terms of capital allocation. I mean we have a $3 billion buyback and that's certainly something that will help and we have our target of 1.5 net debt to EBITDA that we've been laying out. I mean if you lay out on top of the growth of the core business, this is also a driver that will be very helpful when looking at the EPS growth in the next couple of years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Out of those 30 million acres of Intacta that you are looking for, what percentage of those would be third-party feed companies?","Brett Begemann","Yes. So I would -- as you think about Brazil, keep in mind that the Brazilian market has a large supply of multipliers in the marketplace, or call them regional seed companies and the large multinationals like us and others have relatively small seed brand positions, so it mostly goes through license.","So the vast majority of those 30 million acres will come through the licensed business that we have down there, but the trait obviously is the key driver of the value there and that's what we will reflect in the 30 million acres. All of that trait will, of course, be ours with Intacta. But the delivery mechanism is basically through licensed seed companies.","Hugh Grant","Which is a great thing because it gives us the accelerative potential and this is much faster. Your base grows much more quickly than what we see in the U.S., Steve. And the only other thing I would add, I was down in Brazil and Argentina a few weeks ago. Grower satisfaction is extraordinary. I mean we had -- we will see this again with Xtend, but when we rolled with the product in Brazil and Argentina, we had enough varieties to satisfy different climatic zones and different growing conditions, so we feel pretty good about the expansion of this.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Chase & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. It looks from your restructuring charge like you are writing down something by about $450 million. And so I was wondering what you were writing down. The second thing is that of the 2600 employees that you intend to separate, how does that split between ag productivity and seeds and genomics? And then lastly, was Syngenta a one-off opportunity, or is it a strategic priority to build an agricultural chemical franchise through acquisition?","Hugh Grant","Jeff, well done. You got a three for in here. So maybe, Pierre, you can talk to the $450 million and then --","Pierre Courduroux","So regarding the non-cash items, so what we are looking at is -- I mean we've been announcing that we were exiting our sugarcane business, so we got a number of write-offs associated with this one.","We also have, as Brett was mentioning also, we are streamlining our yield and stress program and we've got some intangible assets related to that too and maybe more importantly, we are also rationalizing some of our manufacturing operations as part of the plan that Brett laid out and there are some fixed assets also related to that. So these are the key ones that we are writing off at this point in time.","Hugh Grant","And then, Brett, a quick word on -- yes, I guess I would partition this and I would talk about some of this as cost and modifying our cost to the realities of a harsh market. But there is a piece of this that's transformational as well, Brett.","Brett Begemann","Yes. I think that's the important piece in all of this. So specific to your question of how it breaks out by segment, I'd think about it two ways. First of all, I remind you that we significantly reduced our investment in ag productivity a number of years ago and we are benefiting from that tremendously right now as we see the toughness in the ag productivity market and our GP hanging in there compared to historical standards.","The 2600 as you look across is really across the company and the driver of making it across the company is how we are looking at transforming our company. And I mentioned that the impact of data and data analytics and how it's going to help us, that cuts across our entire supply chain and how we drive our supply chain. Robb has talked often about how it changes how we do our technology work and our breeding and our testing across the company. And this is an opportunity to take our company to a whole different operating model, thinking about how data and analytics drives our company. And that, in fact, drives efficiencies and productivity across the entire corporation. So it doesn't necessarily break out by segments; it breaks out across the entire company as we leverage that approach across the company to drive efficiency.","Hugh Grant","And then your last piece of the trilogy, Jeff, was Syngenta, a one-off. So I guess real briefly we still believe in the opportunity of integrated solutions. We've got a 400 million acre seed technology footprint. We've seen time and time again that we can increase revenue and improve grower service by bringing chemistry up on that footprint. Syngenta was the best option, but based on their behavior, that's gone. So we will continue to look at opportunities, but near term, and I really want to emphasize this, near term, we are going to focus on three things.","We are going to focus on reducing our costs because of the market realities and also because of the transformation opportunities inside the company by applying big data inside the company, we think we can take out significant costs. We are going to drive our core business. I am very encouraged with the performance this year. It gets masked by lousy foreign exchange, but we did really well versus competitors in all of our key markets. So we are going to drive our core and we are going to complete the next tranche of our buyback. We are going to invest in our own company.","There's been a lot of conversation about Monsanto's pivoting, or you are changing. The core strategy remains the same. Earlier this year -- earlier this calendar year, we pointed to the reality of a tough 2015 and a tough 2016. Unfortunately, that has came to pass. I think you see that the performance of our competitors in this environment. I think the symptomology is there. We continue to see duplication in R&D in the sector. We continue to see the low effectiveness of R&D with some of our competitors and we continue to think that consolidation in this space is inevitable. So we are going to focus on the near term. We are going to drive the near-term performance of our business, but we are going to keep a weather eye on the horizon and we are going to keep our ears close to the ground because of the market realities. But you have to work on what you control and what we control at this time is exactly what Pierre talked about. We are going to manage the variables that we've got our hands on and we are going to make this a tighter run business given how tough the environment is.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Koort","Thank you. I will try and limit mine to just one topic. And maybe I will sneak in a Jeff-style multi-question though. On Roundup Ready II Xtend, you guys talked about a $5 to $10 per acre charge and I'm just curious how uniform is the value added of that technology? Is it pretty consistent across your grower base, or is there going to be quite a bit of variability in the cost? And then as you think about extending that, no pun intended, across the other crops, what is the value add for those other crops relative to soybean? Thanks.","Hugh Grant","So thanks for the question. Brett, maybe on the $5 to $10, maybe just a little bit of clarity on that?","Brett Begemann","Yes. I think one of the things that we get so excited about Xtend is because, to your point, Bob, it fits across the entire soybean business in the U.S., as well as cotton and canola and corn. And as we look at the value creation, it's relatively consistent across -- there's two things that drive that range of $5 to $10. One is the variety that it's being delivered in and how new that variety is and it also is driven by the value of that product as we look at a specific marketplace that we are going to be in. But I remind you that, this time around, we have 70 varieties that we are introducing this product in, so we are going to have a really, really broad product launch that really opens up the door for farmers to improve their overall weed control.","When you look at the crops that we are looking at, we already introduced this year this product in cotton and we gave a -- we put a price on it this year of $6 an acre, but I remind you that we rebated that back because we didn't have the label for the dicamba over the top, but the seed itself was approved as an indicator to the cotton farmers that that product was coming, but it's a three-way herbicide, so they could use glufosinate along with their Roundup Ready, which really helped them in the cotton market. So that gives you a range of how we are thinking about cotton.","And corn I would put in the bucket of too early to call. We've been doing work on corn and we clearly have made progress and Robb's team, bringing those products forward. We'll be looking at that and evaluating that as we get closer to the market.","Hugh Grant","Thank you. Bob, you said you had another piece to this, Bob, or are you done?","Operator","Our next question today coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Just on the corn -- price uplift in corn in 2017, how price -- how sensitive is that price mix to the corn price? And just on U.S. corn share, how much did you grow U.S. corn share this growing season?","Hugh Grant","So we haven't put any numbers out on growth yet because the denominator keeps -- there's arguments there. But we would say, in all of our key markets globally, we've held or grew share. And then on sensitivity, it's sensitive. Our pricing power and our pricing ability is directly linked to that. I think 10 years ago, we would've argued more over that, but as time has passed and we've gained more experience, there is a sensitivity. This period we are in right now, depends on who you believe, farm income at the moment is at the lowest it's been in the last 10 to 12 years, so it obviously has an impact. And as we've thought about 2016, we've been -- two points -- one, growers are still selecting out of our premium tier 1\/tier 2 hybrids. So technically the reach for innovation is still alive and well. Our pricing power and our ability to price for that is clearly modulated by that commodity price, absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. I wonder if you could just give us a sense of the pipeline from Climate Corp. and Novozymes. You mentioned Nitrogen Advisor success, but I am curious how quickly we're going to see other things roll out and what crops are looking like that are going to offer the best opportunity in the JV?","Hugh Grant","Mark, thanks for the question. We'll -- so this is the telephonic invitation to come to the party, so we look forward to hosting our biannual event here in St. Louis and we will have swept up field day by then, so that's the really attractive thing about our November date. So we will be in a much better position to give you actual yield data, but we've got a bunch of -- I would guess the biggest microbial trial program that the world has ever seen that we will be reporting on in St. Louis. But, Robb or Brett, any -- I don't want to get ahead of our data, but anything that you could offer or remark at this stage before the November meeting?","Robb Fraley","Sure, I'm looking forward to November and to the traditional pipeline update on the first quarter call. As you pointed out, the partnership with Novozymes has been incredible. I was just listening to their presentation yesterday at an event and a lot of excitement. We took several thousand microbial strains to the field. We are just generating the data and also we are continuing to work to expand the registrations on some of the current products. So the momentum there is very good and the excitement is terrific.","At the Farm Progress Show, just a huge amount of grower interest in the biological products. On the Climate side, I would just say that the growth dimensions that were alluded to in the call are threefold. First of all, we are going to expand geography. So we are looking at testing programs now on expanded geographies in the U.S., but also in Brazil and key other agricultural markets. We are expanding the crop base, so the easy extensions, things like the Plant Health Advisor and the Nitrogen Advisor will have applicability in crops like soybean, corn and cotton and that's key.","And then, finally, we are adding more apps to the advisor service and we are continuing to develop the precision planting apps in terms of targeted patterns for optimizing yield and a variety of additional advisors on everything from other nutrients to further use of the satellite based data. So those are all things that we will roll out in more detail in November.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Robb.","Robb Fraley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Sandy Klugman","I was hoping you could provide an update on the anticipated timeline for Chinese import approvals for Xtend, as well as approval for over-the-top applications of dicamba in the U.S. And then if I remember correctly, early engineering work for the Luling dicamba expansion has been approved, but what would be the timeline for the expansion to receive the full go-ahead?","Hugh Grant","Yes. Thanks for those questions, Sandy. So I think encouraging news, while headline news coming out of President Obama's meeting was that Premier Xi where this topic between the two cabinet teams, this topic was discussed in terms of acceleration, harmonization and improving the data sharing. So I think it's never done, but I think encouraging news there. And then the -- so that covers the -- so nothing definitive, but there's a handful of products waiting on that Chinese approval and I think it sounded like good discussions. And then on the EPA side, we continue to hear it's progressing through that process. But I don't know if -- so I guess that's all we can say on that at the moment. On Luling, we've said this is a three to five-year process, Pierre and we've kind of nodded to the back end of that time -- anything you would add in terms of phasing or timing?","Pierre Courduroux","No, as you mentioned, at this point in time, I mean we are going through the engineering work. So as Hugh was mentioning, out of the three to five years, we've been talking about regarding this investment. The lion's share of the investment would be later in the three to five years for sure.","Hugh Grant","And we see that as necessary priming the pump. It's going to be an absolutely huge product. So we need to get ready to prime the pump and I would anticipate we will see European, Chinese and Indian manufacturers following with the size of that product. Robb, do you --?","Robb Fraley","Yes. I just wanted to add again feedback from Farm Progress and all the trials this year, the enthusiasm for the Xtend technology, both in cotton and soybean and anticipating what it will do in corn and wheat and other crops has been at a high level. I mean in many ways, it kind of reminds me of the launch of the original Roundup Ready technology back in 1996, I think, in terms of the breakthrough that it represents for farmers in terms of simplifying weed control and giving them just an incredible tool. So lots of momentum there.","Hugh Grant","And we will share some of that data at the November event as well. So let me conclude. I want to respect your time. We've run a little bit over, but we did have a lot to cover today. It isn't often that we talk about 2015, 2016 and 2017 and then nod towards 2019 and 2025. So we covered a lot of ground.","Let me just try and summarize this. I think despite weakening global currency and commodity prices, we do continue to view this as a prime opportunity for the business. But you need the balance of innovation and discipline that can grow our long-term competitive position. I hope today you sense that we approach this period with focus and cost discipline centered on our core business and our capital allocation strategy and this will remain our focus.","Our strategy, as always, is grounded in the foundation of our leading seed technologies and our crop protection solutions. And this, in the future, is to be ever more fully integrated by the extraordinary potential of digital agriculture. And we will continue to look beyond the transitory macro factors, and I think they are transitory, to the longer-term opportunities to lead this evolution to integrated solutions in agriculture.","So we as a team are looking forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming biannual investor event in November 17 and 18 here in St. Louis. We will be able to share more insights into both our near-term and longer-term growth drivers that we believe will fuel this continued evolution in the remarkable agricultural sector. So thanks very much for your support and your time this morning and we look forward to seeing many of you in St. Louis. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Ms. Meyer, you may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Michelle, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m joined today by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team is Ben Kampelman.","During our fourth quarter call today, we'll share how we closed out fiscal year 2017, and we'll provide an early look into how we're thinking about 2018. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and replay at monsanto.com.","We provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release.","The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our year-end results, as shown on Slide 5. We delivered strong growth with as-reported earnings per share of $5.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $5.50 as compared to last year's as-reported full year earnings per share of $2.99 and ongoing earnings per share of $4.48. Our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $2 billion as compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year.","Hugh, I'll turn it over to you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much, Laura. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. At the outset of this fiscal year, we outlined 2 clear priorities upon which we judge success at year's end.","The first was delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and the second was to continue executing the necessary steps to close the deal with Bayer. With focus and discipline, our team did both, and I'm extremely proud of what we delivered.","In what may be our final full year conference call as Monsanto, I couldn't be more pleased with the results. We delivered record sales and gross profit in our Seeds and Genomics segment in fiscal year 2017, fueled by the outstanding penetration of our latest soybean and cotton technologies and continued adoption of our newest corn hybrids around the globe, reflecting the need for new solutions in what continues to be a challenging ag economy.","Clearly, our proven ability to innovate as well as our unique platform advantages position us well to meet the production challenges of today as well as the demands of tomorrow, as shown on Slide 6.","New products and services will remain crucial to meeting that demand. And leading the way is our strong foundation of seeds, traits, digital ag and chemistry solutions like the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, Climate FieldView offerings and NemaStrike Technology, all outlined on Slide 7.","The outlook for these new offerings is bright. In fiscal year '18, the Climate FieldView platform is expected to reach 50 million paid acres globally. Our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology is launching across 6 million to 8 million acres in the U.S.","And we, along with our partners, expect to have supply to double the penetration of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. Momentum builds with continued INTACTA penetration in South America, and growers continue to demand our newest corn hybrids, particularly our Disease Shield hybrids, which were sold out in fiscal year '17.","Given these strong drivers, we remain confident in the outlook for the business. Looking specifically at the first quarter, we anticipate our earnings per share to be stronger than last year with growth expected to come primarily from soybean technologies and better pricing in Ag Productivity. Looking beyond Q1, we will refrain from specifics as we anticipate closing on the merger with Bayer at the beginning of the New Year.","With that, let's turn our focus towards the status of the pending combination with Bayer on Slide 8. Bayer continues to lead the regulatory filing process, and progress is moving along, as expected, around the world.","All the key filings have been made, and more than 1\/3 of the approvals have been received from the authorities with whom we filed. We continue to cooperate with regulators as they work through the reviews, and we look forward to positive outcomes.","Beyond our work with regulators, we're also continuing outreach with stakeholders to convey the innovation opportunity that this deal can have on the future of agriculture. While some divestitures will occur in limited areas of overlap with Bayer, we believe in the potential to further evolve our leadership role in agriculture through this deal.","We expect to meet this challenge by delivering even greater benefits to our customers, as outlined in Slide 9. In fact, that commitment is exemplified by our significant R&D expansion in St. Louis that's just recently came online.","In the interim, we remain focused on delivering our new technologies, and we look forward to the possibilities that our combined pipelines and world-class teams can create for growers in the future.","So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update.","Brett Begemann","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. With record-setting sales and gross profit in Seeds and Genomics, 2017 was certainly a banner year for us. Our teams delivered strongly on our key business imperatives, and their unrelenting focus sets us up well for this year.","We expect continued momentum for our new products, and my confidence has been reinforced by recent interactions with growers around the globe. Despite low commodity prices, the demand for new tools only grows.","Let's start first with corn, where our gross profit grew by 15%. This was driven primarily by better pricing, mostly in South America on a growing acreage base and a better-than-anticipated benefit from a strategic licensing deal in corn in the fourth quarter.","Globally, we also delivered the improvement in cost of goods we were expecting with U.S. production volumes increasing. As harvest progresses in the Northern Hemisphere, we look forward to sharing our yield performance numbers in the months ahead.","Taking a longer view on Slide 10. We expect that launching new hybrids globally will continue to create price-mix lift and genetic share gains. For the first quarter specifically, we expect corn acres to decline in the first season in Brazil and do not expect to repeat the price gains of last year given the decline in the commodity prices there.","Moving to soybeans on Slide 11. We delivered an impressive 35% growth in our gross profit, coupled with nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp year in Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans saw our final U.S. acre count at greater than 20 million, as shown on Slide 12, which showcased the demand for better weed control.","As outlined on Slide 13, the vast majority of growers had a positive experience with the system, and we are hearing from many who have a desire to significantly increase their on-farm use in the coming year.","For those who did not, we remain dedicated to improving their experience with the system, and we are actively developing plans to reinforce and expand our training and grower education efforts across the country. We'll take full advantage of the months ahead to broaden and deepen the understanding of the technology's application requirements so that more farmers can experience the benefits that this system can offer.","For 2018, this will set the stage in a year where we, along with our licensee partners, expect to have supply available to double penetration to more than 40 million acres and to offer the trait in more than 300 varieties in our brands alone.","Moving to South America on Slide 14, INTACTA Roundup Ready 2 Pro soybeans continue to provide great value through better insect control and yields, and the trait reached more than 50 million acres this year. This lay solid footing for 2018 as we now expect more than 60 million acres throughout South America coupled with anticipated price improvement in Brazil.","In our cotton business, shown on Slide 15, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton reached more than 6 million acres, and our branded and licensed to cotton genetic share in the U.S. grew by nearly 13 points on a growing acreage base, which is the second year of that level of exceptional share growth. Next year, given the strong demand for our cotton technologies, we expect continued brand share gains and similar Bollgard II XtendFlex trait intensity even with planted acres likely to decline.","Shifting to NemaStrike Technology on Slide 16. Our teams are excited about launching this novel nematicide on an expected 6 million to 8 million acres of corn, soybeans and cotton in the U.S. It's been priced at a premium that reflects its consistent yield protection, and we planted more than 400 Ground Breaker trials this summer to allow growers to see it firsthand.","Moving to the Climate FieldView platform on Slide 17. The strategic differentiators for Climate, the strength of the platform adoption and the collaborations and partnerships, both saw meaningful advancements this year. One significant development was the recent signing of a new connectivity agreement with AGCO as well as the sale of the Precision Planting business to them, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. This sale allows us to focus more exclusively on the Climate FieldView platform, which continues to make great strides.","We landed on more than 35 million paid acres in fiscal year 2017, with a line of sight to reach 50 million paid acres globally next year, driven by 7 advancements and enhancements to the platform. Beyond the U.S., as shown on Slide 18, we continued global expansion with a commercial launch in Brazil and Europe, and we look forward to launching in western Canada this fiscal year.","Moving to Ag Productivity. We remain optimistic about the anticipated results of the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe, which we expect sometime before mid-December.","We're encouraged that the EU risk assessment process has reaffirmed the science supporting the safety and efficacy of glyphosate and by the dialogue we're hearing from farmers across Europe who continue to reiterate that it is an indispensable tool.","Within the Ag Productivity businesses, we saw the glyphosate price improvements over the prior year in the second half, as we had anticipated, and our gross profit of $892 million for the full year was well within the range we outlined at the outset of the year.","This improved glyphosate pricing trend is continuing with recent increases in our U.S. branded prices, in line with our strategy to maintain a premium over generics, and we expect it to lead to better gross profit in the segment for the first quarter. In addition, we expect that volumes sold of XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology will continue to grow with the expansion of the system.","All in all, I'm pleased to see the record penetration levels of our newest traits and record results our teams delivered in Seeds and Genomics. As we move through harvest and begin fiscal year 2018, I look forward to continued momentum and adoption of the new solutions we're bringing to our customers.","With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review.","Pierre Courduroux","Thank you, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fourth quarter earnings per share, which came in better than the prior year and our expectations at $0.05 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.20 per share on an ongoing basis.","These results came in stronger than we had anticipated due to additional tax benefits and better-than-expected corn gross profits from the strategic license Brett mentioned earlier. With the continuing consolidation in the industry, we had the opportunity to grant the right to some key corn licenses in Brazil, resulting in a benefit of more than $200 million in Q4. We expect to continue to receive ongoing royalties from those licenses.","Beyond of these factors, the results were in line with our expectations: the U.S. business closed out much as we anticipated; Ag Productivity gross profit declined modestly, primarily from the absence of the Latitude fungicide business; and SG&A and R&D spend was higher primarily due to higher incentive expense and commissions stemming from the strong growth in the business.","In addition, we had gains from non-core asset sales of about $70 million in our income and expense roughly split between the segments as we had guided. This compares to $157 million in gains from sorghum asset sales in Q4 of fiscal year '16.","The fourth quarter was simply the capstone for how the entire year came together. We grew gross profit by an impressive 16% in Seeds and Genomics, posted a record high for both sales and gross profit in the segment while improving margins with new technology penetration. We remain true to our brand premium strategy and our productivity and delivered in gross profit in the range we expected.","And finally, our SG&A and R&D spend, while growing with the business, remain relatively consistent as a percent of sales for the full year as we continue to execute on our cost savings and restructuring initiatives.","In terms of free cash flow, we delivered $2 billion for the year, which was above the high end of our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. This improvement from the prior year was driven by the excellent growth in the business and strong collections resulting from our prudent management of risk in a difficult ag environment.","For fiscal year of 2018, as shown on Slide 19, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of the fiscal year to improve, with growth primarily coming from stronger INTACTA pricing and penetration in South America, higher Ag Productivity gross profit from improved glyphosate pricing and gain on the sale of the Precision Planning business to AGCO.","Looking now at the full year, let me share some guideposts to help shape your thinking.","Hugh and Brett shared our outlook for penetration of many of our new technologies, which will greatly influence the results. Specifically, we expect the penetration of pricing of INTACTA, additional acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, price and share gains from the introduction of new corn hybrids and price premiums from the NemaStrike Technology to be growth contributors.","Pricing for glyphosate is expected to be better, at least for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and volumes of XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology are expected to expand. You have to balance those factors against the expected decline in corn acres in Brazil and against the fact that commodity pricing for corn remains challenging around the globe.","We expect that our tax rate will normalize and that the contributions from strategic portfolio management will likely fall below the roughly $350 million pretax average annual contribution we've seen for the last 3 years.","We remain committed to completing the restructuring and cost savings initiatives we began in fiscal year '15, as shown on Slide 20, and expect our SG&A and R&D spend to be relatively flat year-over-year.","In closing, our teams have done an exceptional job in delivering on our 2 imperatives for the year, and we look forward to continuing with that focus and discipline as we move through our first fiscal quarter and are anticipating closing with Bayer in early 2018.","Thank you for your time today. And with that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions.","Laura Meyer","Thanks, Pierre. With that, we'll now open the call for 20 minutes of questions. As we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person \u2013 one per person, so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. Michelle, we\u2019re ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning everyone.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Vincent Andrews","Can you just give us your view on - I know in INTACTA this year, the original discount that was provided as part of the Roundup 1 agreement goes away. Could you just give us your sort of - what you're seeing already and your level of conviction that you're going to be able to hold what should be a higher price point year-over-year?","Hugh Grant","Yes, Vincent, thanks for your question. Maybe, Brett, you can say a few words to Vincent's point on the change this year?","Brett Begemann","And you noted one of the key factors in that. I think it's important to start that INTACTA has continued to deliver incredible insect control as well as yield gains for growers, and we reached 50 million acres this year and expect to be close to 60 million next year.","One of the key things for pricing is through the transition from Roundup Ready 1 to INTACTA, there were some covenants with the growers in making that transition, and those have now expired.","So as we look at the value that the product is delivering in the marketplace and priced into the marketplace this year, we would anticipate somewhere in the range of double-digit price improvement on INTACTA for next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Yes. I had a question on Xtend. Obviously, a lot of stories and issues around off-target damage. I'm just wondering what impact you think this has on the growth of the trait. And as you review what happened this year, how much of the grower experience was due to grower-related issues such as spray drift, et cetera, versus is there a fundamental problem with the new formulations of dicamba themselves such as volatilization?","Hugh Grant","Don, thanks for your question. Before I pass it to Brett, just a couple observations. Between beans and cotton, we'll be on 26-ish million acres this year. So in what essentially was our first commercial year or rollout, there's been extraordinary penetration.","So to answer your question right up front, we're delighted with the product. We're delighted with the penetration. And I think that's got a little bit lost in some of the noise that we got a lot of very, very happy customers. It's true there were some that experienced leaf cupping, but the vast majority have had excellent results.","And as combines have begun - or run through those fields, the feedback has been quite exceptional. But Brett, maybe a few words to Don's question on spray application and just the hygiene of the product.","Brett Begemann","Yes. Good morning, Don As you mentioned, just a tremendous launch of the product, and I think it speaks volumes to the challenges that farmers have in controlling weeds in the market. I think the key that I look at is the vast majority of farmers had a really good experience, as you noted.","But there are exceptions to that, and we are following up each and every one of those particular claims to ensure we have a full understanding of how the product performed in the marketplace.","I'd also note that just last week, I participated in the academic summit that we had, and it was an exceptional meeting and surpassed our expectations and shared a lot of information with the academics and vice versa, them sharing with us.","So we're in the process of looking through all of that data to draw conclusions on the outcomes this year as well as working with the EPA in a collaborative way to make sure that we have a plan in place where all farmers have a great experience next year.","I mean, as you look at some of the things, to your specific point, in the marketplace that we observed this year, there are some cases where buffers maybe could have been followed a little better than they were.","There's cases where tank cleanout maybe wasn't done quite as well as it should be, and that's -- farmers have been using products that are a little more forgiving than the dicamba technologies.","So we got to work on that. In some cases, we found nozzles that probably weren't the appropriate nozzle to be used in -- for the application. So there's a number of things, Don, that we'll double down on the training and working with our academic colleagues to make sure that we have farmers fully aware and experienced next year going into the season.","But I think it's notable to also note that as you said, the yields are coming in strong, and we feel really good about our prospects for next year. And that's why we're, along with our licensees, prepared to double the penetration next year.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes in the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Yes, I think your Acceleron seed treatment now includes the NemaStrike in it and maybe a Bayer insecticide in it. But wanted to know what your thoughts were longer term about the potential to load in more Bayer chemistry into those seed treatments and leverage the Monsanto seed platform over into crop chemistry.","Hugh Grant","Yes. So I think there's a real -- thanks for your questions, Steve. I think there's a real opportunity there. We said we got the approval in NemaStrike late in the year. We kind of got it to the fields just in the nick of time. We'll see how yields pan out, but a lot of the early root digs are looking very encouraging. So 6 million to 8 million acres next year, I think, is definitely doable.","And I think you're right, the combination with Bayer chemistry, I think, brings another great opportunity. The way we've always looked at this is we look for the best possible chemistry that's out there and you're optimizing yields.","And when you put out brand-new hybrids every year, you - our general philosophy has been you put the very best technology you can on that and remain agnostic for the source. But I think there's real opportunities with some of the Bayer stuff as well as others from other stables as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi, good morning. I have a few questions about INTACTA. How did you fare in Argentina this year? That is, how many acres did INTACTA go on? And where do the patent issues in Argentina stand and how will that affect you in 2018?","Your projection is for 60 million acres of INTACTA in '18 but for 75 million in '19. So you have a 25% rate of growth in '19, 20% in '18. Why does the growth rate accelerate in '19, I guess? So those are my INTACTA questions.","Brett Begemann","Yes, good morning, Jeff. This is Brett. Thanks for the question. So INTACTA was a great success in South America again this year, and we've been talking about it to South America for a couple of years now rather than trying to differentiate between the various countries because you also have Paraguay and Uruguay stuck in the middle there between Argentina and Brazil.","And the markets are a bit different in Argentina. Particularly, the North looks a lot like Brazil and the middle and southern looks a lot less insect pressure. So specific to your question in Argentina, we feel really good about our patent protection in Argentina.","We have good patent coverage of multiple patents in Argentina. We feel really good about the progress that we've made in working with the coalition in the marketplace, working both with farmers and farmer unions as well as the government on a POD system in Argentina. It worked this year, and it's set up to work even better going into next year.","So there's always the challenges with that in the early years, no different than the experience in Brazil, but we feel good about our position. As we look at the penetration, we see substantial penetration in Brazil. We expect that to continue next year as well as in the following year.","And we would anticipate that we'll see an acceleration in Argentina as the POD system becomes more sophisticated and spread out across the country, more varieties available with INTACTA, et cetera.","So when you look at year-over-year from '18 to '19, that's the anticipation of more activity in Argentina coming online as more varieties are available. And as you know, we slowed down our efforts in Argentina when he had the early challenges with POD.","And because of that slowdown, well, other seed companies and us were slower to bring varieties and market fits. So we're starting to accelerate that now as the POD is in a better position, so I feel good about that 75 million number in '19.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you so much.","Brett Begemann","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Jackson","Hi, thank you. There are some news hitting the wire today that the Brazilian regulator might be concerned on INTACTA as part of the Bayer-Mon tie-up. Can you talk about that and if there's any risk there? Thanks.","Hugh Grant","Yes, Joel, thanks. It's Hugh here. I would - you're right, it just crossed the wire this morning, but we would characterize this coming from CADE, the regulatory authorities in Brazil, as just a normal step within the review process. So Bayer continues to lead that process. We're supporting them around the world.","And if you look at Brazil, you look at the rest of the world, we continue to be encouraged by the progress that we're making overall. So I don't think any new news out of the Brazilians that - this morning.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Thanks. Just in case you don't have one more earnings call, I want to say thanks for a great run as a public firm. I wish you all the success at Bayer.","Hugh Grant","That's very kind of you, John. Thank you very much.","John Roberts","Back on the dicamba drift issue. I remember when insect tolerance was introduced farmers had trouble initially dealing with the refuge acreage kind of issue. Is it fair to think about this as kind of a learning curve kind of new technology issue like we had back with that? Or do you think it's actually going to be a little bit more challenging to find a solution for them?","Hugh Grant","No, I think it's quite analogous, John. It kind of goes to our earlier comment. We've been at this for nearly 20 years. And if you look back, our experience with Roundup Ready 2s, with SmartStax with some of the early refuge issues, with insect-protected crops, I think some of this is the same.","Brett talked about being focused on buffer strips, being focused on cleanout, being focused on good nozzle selection. And I'm confident the feedback that we're hearing from growers, the vast majority of whom had good results, this is solvable with a bit more education and a bit more focus. So I think it's a fair comparison.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Jones with Redburn Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Tony Jones","Thanks very much for taking the call. Just a quick comment, a quick question on corn and the price cuts. So I think, Brett, this is probably a question for you actually, but you acknowledged that commodity prices are a little bit low on corn. How responsive have been farmers, growers, distributors to price cuts so far?","Brett Begemann","Good morning, Tony or good afternoon to you. It's early in the season. So that's the caveat that I would put against this. But the early responses has been -- I would put it in the category of as expected.","As I noted and you confirmed, the commodity price situation is challenging around the world. As we've moved into South America, which is our early market, we're performing as expected down there.","I'd say our orders feel reasonable. The market's going to be a lot smaller. That's clear. Third parties saying that acres are going to be down 20% to 30%. But we're doing fine in that market. In North America, harvest is coming in, products are performing.","And as we see every year, regardless of the challenge in the marketplace, farmers are really in tune with the newest hybrids, the best products. For example, we sold out our Disease Shield products this year. Those were our latest release and our best products.","We'll - we believe that we'll see that same kind of demand for our new releases and new hybrids this year, and we'll have to see how the market plays out. But right now, most of our new releases are up in price, as you would expect.","And with the products that are a bit older in the marketplace, they're flattish. I'd see the competitive market being reasonable at this point in time, but we'll just have to keep following it through the next month or 2 to see how that plays out.","Tony Jones","Great. Appreciate the detail. Maybe just one small follow-up there. Do you think then that the sort of the trading down that we'd saw - that we've seen in the past few years are finished pretty much?","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think in the early days, you -- and I always referred to it as the farmers on the fringe, that were on the edge, did they really have root worm or we're they just using SmartStax as kind of protection for the what if? That's all occurred. And if you look at it this year, there was very little of that even this year in '17.","So I think we're out of that. I think it's pretty much farmers know what they have in their fields and what they need, and I think that -- I see the market being more normalized next year as we go into that.","Tony Jones","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Brett Begemann","Thanks for your question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on soy as well. You talked about lower corn-planted acres in Brazil. Do you have any view on soy down there as well as in North America? Thanks.","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think the -- at this point in time, it's a guessing game on acres. And we're -- I will put it in the category we're pretty confident corn acres are going to be down in the first season in Brazil, and third parties are confirming that. I don't see the same kind of reduction in Argentina.","I would anticipate that those acres are replaced with soybeans, but they have options in Brazil to other crops as well and we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. I remind you that in Brazil, they get 2 cracks at corn, so they have the summer season that they're going into, and then they have the winter safrinha season.","So they're less sensitive to a singular planting. They can make up for corn in safrinha if they need to. And we don't anticipate the same kind of decline in safrinha that we're seeing in the summer season. So I would anticipate at this point that in most cases, beans replace the corn acres that are down, down there.","In North America, I say it's way too early. Farmers aren't going to make those calls. They're worried about harvesting right now and getting the crop out of the field. And then they'll start thinking about next year.","Hugh Grant","Arun, the only other thing I'd remind you of that Brett touched on is the Brazilian corn market is the domestic market. So the production is usually largely kept within the country. Beans are globally traded, so beans will probably follow much more closely what happens in the U.S.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","Laura Meyer","And Michelle, this all need to be our last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Rizzo","Good morning. It's Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Does Bayer have a nematicide product that competes with NemaStrike? Is there overlap there at all?","Hugh Grant","I don't know. I don't think so. I'm looking around the table. We don't think that they have a nematicide. The extraordinary thing about NemaStrike is its brand-new chemistry that was built on the backbone of the genomics of the nematode. So we reversed-engineered from biology, and it really puts it in a very unique class of its own.","So I'm not aware of what Bayer has in that space, but I think the performance of NemaStrike that we've seen in our own small trials and the feedback we're getting, it's -- I think, is going to carve out a completely unique niche in nematode control.","And the other fascinating thing about it is nematodes as a problem are extraordinarily widespread, but growers have not really had a tool to control them until now.","So it really reminds me in a lot of ways of the early days with corn rootworm, where the actual market and the actual products that were there were dwarfed by the introduction of proper control. I think we'll probably see the same thing happen when NemaStrike comes in the future.","Dan Rizzo","Thank you very much.","Hugh Grant","Thank you. Thanks for your question. I - I'll bring this session to a close and thank you for your attention and your support. I guess I would close the way that I started. I think my team has done an outstanding job of delivering on our operational plan and our deal milestones for the year while we continue to serve and support our customers. And that's quite remarkable given the risk of distraction, so I'm very proud of what they've done.","Given that, we plan to continue to execute on exactly the same deliverables as we move through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and we are really looking forward to the benefits that we envision that the pending combination with Bayer will bring to our grower customers around the world. So with that, thanks very much for joining us on the call this morning.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"14663":["Monsanto (NYSE:MON) Q1 2012 Earnings Call January  5, 2012  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Robert T.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto Company. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thank you, Dan, and good morning to everyone on the line. Thanks for joining Monsanto's First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Pierre Courduroux; our CFO; as well as Robb Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me are Manny Cruz and Bryan Corkal, my colleagues in Investor Relations. ","This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address. We're providing you today with EPS measures, both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are posted to our website. ","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial risks. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. ","Today's an extended conference call that features the annual review of our R&D pipeline results with Robb. Before we cover that, Pierre will walk you through the quarterly financial results and our guidance outlook. Then, Hugh will cover the strategic checkpoint, including the U.S. order outlook. ","So with that, let me hand the time over to Pierre to start us with the financial review.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line. The first quarter results we reported today reflect better-than-expected performance from our Latin American business. They also reflect some timing benefits from our Australian cotton business and some early positives from the U.S. These results were even better than our revised quarterly guidance of a month ago. With these strong results in hand and an additional month of data on our business outlook, it gives me the confidence to point to the upper end of our original EPS range for the full year, even at this early point in the season. ","Before we go into the details of the financial results, let me place the first quarter in a more precise perspective. First, we are, of course, very pleased with our first quarter results, as they confirm our emerging opportunity from Latin America, especially in corn. Compared with last year, we grew ongoing EPS by $0.20 this quarter. This is strong growth at this early point, and it is consistent with our plan that considers delivering 60% of our full year gross profit growth from our international business. ","But with less than 10% of our expected total full year earnings, the first quarter is still a small quarter. I personally believe in a proven approach to updating guidance, making sure the projections we communicate are backed by solid data points in the business. Today, with the strong results we've seen through December and the positive outlook coming out of our U.S. order book, we have greater clarity that gives us the confidence to take our full year EPS guidance to the upper half of the previous range. But with the U.S. season still ahead of us, and the reality that there's volatility in the broader economic environment, we will not get ahead of the business. Against that backdrop, I feel good about translating the early strengths in our business to full year performance. ","Let me now move from that overview to the specifics of our financial results on Slide 4. Ongoing earnings per share was $0.23, which was ahead of our quarterly guidance, but in line with our expectation for a more significant first quarter. That compares with ongoing EPS of $0.03 in the first quarter of last year. As expected, the most important driver is the growth in the Seeds and Genomics. Sales and gross profit both increased more than 30%. And there's really 2 key factors driving that change. One is the core business driver and the other as an element of timing. ","The first and biggest business driver is Latin America. The Seed business delivered at the high end of our expectations and you can see this in our Corn Seed and Traits numbers where quarterly gross profit was up almost 60% relative to last year. This growth was driven by the mixed benefit that came from significant trade expansion and by volume growth in both Brazil and Argentina. And that year-over-year gain flows very nicely through to the margins, where the Corn Seeds and Traits gross profit as a percent of sales came in at almost 60% compared with 55% in the prior year.","The second factor of growth revolves around cotton, where we saw a quarterly uptick in gross profit from our Australian business. As last year, the total planted acreage in the high-value cotton market in Australia stands at historical highs as the acres have rebounded following several years of drought. And in addition to the business performance, roughly $0.04 in cotton EPS reflect a pure timing shift in this business. ","In Australia, growers have the option of either buying the technology upfront or following harvest based on yield. This year, more farmers chose to buy upfront rather than after harvest, and this shifts those $0.04 from the fourth quarter of 2012 into this first quarter. ","For the other crops, Q1 is a small quarter. In soybeans, we saw some gross profit contribution as the final royalties came through the point of delivery system in Brazil. But we also saw the vegetable gross profit decline in the quarter due to some softness in the higher value vegetable market in Europe, as well as some timing shift in the Americas. ","On the Ag Productivity side of the business and albeit in a small quarter, gross profit is up about 24% compared with last year. This reflects continued solid performance across that segment and it keeps us right on pace to achieve the approximately $800 million target in total gross profit from Ag Productivity for the full year.","Below-the-line operating expenses for the quarter are also tracking with our full year guidance expectations. SG&A in the quarter was $500 million. This is higher than last year and reflects in part the Latin American business growth in the quarter as a portion of our SG&A expense comes from related commissions. ","On the R&D line, our expenses were $351 million, which is somewhat higher than last year as we increased on spending for more projects. But this keeps us within our projection for our full year R&D spend.","The strength of the first quarter also shows up through our free cash results. Quarterly free cash flow was $856 million compared with $500 million last year. The increase reflects growth in net income, as well as an increase in the prepays in front of the U.S. season, which are ahead of last year's pace. Importantly, these prepays are a good early indicator of U.S. purchase patterns and are a positive indicator that supports the momentum in the order book that Hugh will cover. And you can actually see a reflection of those strong prepays in the year-over-year increase in deferred revenues on the cash flow statement. ","Now on Slide 5, we roll out the complete guidance elements for the fiscal year. As we translate the strong Q1 performance into the full year, we move up the low end of our guidance and are on track to achieve the upper end of our original guidance or $3.39 to $3.44 of ongoing EPS, and it also tracks with our overall free cash target of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. ","If you now go to Slide 6, here is how I see the earnings cycle for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned, roughly half of our expected EPS growth for the full year is reflected in this first quarter. Given the Latin American contribution, that's right in line with our expectation that roughly 60% of our GP growth in 2012 will come from our international business. We expect the remainder of the growth to be spread among the second and third quarters, as we expect growth in our U.S. business as well. We expect growth over last year in both of these quarters, but not on the same order of magnitude as we saw in the first quarter with the significant Latin American contributions. ","In terms of drivers, we expect the momentum in the corn business will continue to drive our overall Seeds and Traits performance. Specifically, we expect continued strong growth in our corn platform in the U.S. for the second and third quarters. We anticipate less contribution to the overall growth from cotton and soybeans, as we are not planning for the same level of acres in favorable conditions as we saw in 2011. Reflecting the trend we saw in Q1, we also expect relatively limited growth from our vegetable business for the full year. ","Finally, we expect the fourth quarter to still be a loss, but with the emergence of the Latin American business, we should see an increasing contribution from Seeds and Genomics over time. But for 2012, the shift of the fourth quarter cotton revenue from Australia into the first quarter means that a portion of that Seeds and Genomics opportunity has already been reflected. And with that shift, we don't see a significant change in the quarterly loss in 2012 relative to last year. ","So as I wrap up, I will leave you with 2 key thoughts for how we carry the first quarter into our full year. It's still very early, but the first quarter is a strong start. We've seen growth come from the areas we expected and that positions us right where we need to be at this point in the year to realize the upper half of our full year EPS expectations. And within that, we have seen the contribution from a more balanced international business and that is important as it speaks to the flexibility in managing our business and the clarity we have in delivering on our mid-teens earnings growth objectives this year. ","With that background of the quarter, let me hand the time over to Hugh.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much, Pierre. And let me also wish everybody on the line the very best in the coming new year. The first quarter was a strong quarter. As the first checkpoint, the early strength validates both the business momentum behind our confidence in our 2012 growth and the drivers that create our opportunity beyond this year. ","At this point, 3 things strike me. First, our pipeline progress continues to move ahead and be a competitive differentiator, and that's even more important as we put an even greater focus on delivering yields to our growers. Second, to add emphasis to a point that Pierre's already made, the growth in Latin America isn't just an important financial contributor. It's an increasingly important strategic growth driver. With the proof points in hand, we can confidently see the game-changing effect that the Latin American opportunity can have in driving growth over the midterm horizon. And third, our early orders in the U.S. underscore that the momentum that we started to rebuild in 2011 is carrying into 2012. At this time a year ago, the order book check was the early validation that we could successfully reset our U.S. product and pricing strategy. Today, I see the early orders as the indicator that our momentum is strong and our platform opportunities are real. ","These all underscore the confidence that shows as we point to the upper half of our EPS guidance range today. They also reinforce the point that we made at our Investor Day in November that the key to our strategy is delivering yield to our farmer customers. We believe that we're the best positioned in that ability. And for when we are able to deliver yield, there's real value that shows up in our growth.","One of the biggest proof points of that is the emergence of the corn opportunity in Latin America. You see this most acutely in Brazil, which is highlighted in Slide 7. And just the fourth year since initial approval, the trait penetration this season stands at more than 75%. You see this rapid adoption occurring simultaneously with upgrades to higher value traits. We're seeing a significant step-up in acres from first- to second-generation singles this year with even further upgrade opportunity as we move our offerings for our Double PRO over time. With each of these upgrades, there's significant new value for the farmer, and the value of the acre increases for us, driving our mixed benefit. ","The same effect is true for Argentina on Slide 8. In Argentina, we're in upgrade mode, as farmers are beginning to choose to upgrade from their established doubles to the new Genuity VT Triple PRO, which is in its first year of widespread availability. ","If you shift to the U.S., 2012 is a bit different than the past couple of years, as we're coming out of a harvest where our products really distinguished themselves across the board. From a strategy perspective, our ability to deliver that total package of yield is a critical factor in defining how our customers see us. And that in turn sets up the first look at how our performance translates into the order book. ","So let me give you that data. As of December 31, the order pace for our U.S. portfolio is ahead of the same point in time last year and tracking well against our 2012 targets. Last year was a strong year for our U.S. business and we're tracking ahead of that pace this year. We're in a growth mode, so our targets revolve around 3 key variables. Unit volume growth, the germplasm upgrade and our trait mix. Against that, our total volume is ahead of last year's pace and our portfolio mix is tracking squarely with our planning assumptions. ","As a metric, prepays are also strong and coming in earlier this year. As Pierre indicated, a good portion of the cash flow that we've seen in the quarter reflects these strong prepays, which is a good indicator that there's solid commitments behind the order book. ","Additionally, in a year where the perception of tighter corn supply likely drove some early orders in the industry, the key cancellation deadlines for corn are now behind us, so we've got good clarity that the order uptick that we've seen reflects real growth. That current order mix validates our confidence that we\u2019ll expand the penetration of our key product platforms in both corn and soybeans, and that's reflected on Slide 9. We\u2019ve a strong response to the rollout and the ramp-up of our RIB Complete products for Genuity SmartStax and VT Double PRO this year. That's translated to orders and it\u2019s tracking very well to achieve the 22 million to 24 million acres that we've targeted for our Reduced Refuge Corn Family this season.","Likewise, the order book also reflects strong demand for our products with rootworm traits. For a number of years now, farmers have seen the value of rootworm control first hand. That proven performance shows up in the orders, as we're squarely on track with our expectations for our flagship Triples and the key products in our Reduced Refuge Family. Likewise, with widely recognized performance of Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans in the marketplace, we're tracking very well towards our targeted range of 27 million to 30 million acres. That speaks to the third year momentum as farmers experience the performance of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in a much broader lineup varieties.","So the bottom line in all of this, is the order book is strong. That speaks to the opportunity that we see in the U.S. for growth of our key platforms, for volume growth and for sales that flow through our financial statements. It's still too early to declare victory, but we're clearly where we need to be at this point in the year. ","So from that operational look, I want to wrap up with a word on one of the most strategic checkpoints at this time of the year and that's our R&D pipeline. We're bringing to bear more tools than ever and we're making the conscious effort to make sure that we highlight the complete toolkit, ranging from the leverage created by breeding to our unmatched biotech pipeline. We're the only company to have that total package today, and that positions us best to deliver yield to our grower customers. ","So with that, let me give the floor to Dr. Fraley for the tour of our pipeline this year.","Robert T. Fraley","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everybody on the line. When I outlined our R&D strategy at our November Investor Day, I focused on 2 points. First, that the competitive advantage created by our R&D engine is expanding; and second, that our R&D differentiation comes because we're uniquely positioned today to drive total yield, with the convergence of the industry's most advanced technology platforms. And remember, farmers buy yield, and that's where we're focused and that's what matters to the bottom line as we deliver yield to customers. ","The proof of that converging yield opportunity is in this year's pipeline update. In 2011, we saw significant progress and formal advancement in every one of our platforms. So if I begin on Slide 3 of our R&D Slide, the progress is clear. Number one, this is a record year for progress within our pipeline, with 14 total advancements or additions across our R&D platforms and 8 advancements specifically in the biotech pipeline. You will see significant annual progress balanced among all of our research areas and an R&D pipeline that's expanding. ","Number two, you see that the same concept of balance within the platforms. On Slide 4, you see only the biotech advancements. And if you do the 2-year look, including our recent product launches, almost 2\/3 of our biotech projects have advanced. The symmetry tells the story. There are advances in every major crop at every development phase and from both the agronomic and yield-and-stress project. ","Number three, if you expand the view to look at the platforms by crop, you see the power of the integrated approach to delivering yield on Slides 5 and 6. This is the convergence we've talked about and it reflects an expanded pipeline built around yield that we'll focus on going forward. We're known for our early investment in biotech, but we never rested on that. And today, we're driving even greater progress across more platforms. ","And finally, there's no better proof point of the value in R&D convergence than in the results from our breeding platform in 2011. From the U.S. data I first showed in November to the breakthroughs we're making in next-generation tools, our breeding advantage increasingly contributes to our commercial advantage. ","So with that, I want to dive into the update, and I'll begin with yield-and-stress pipeline on Slide 7. Yield and stress is the next frontier that flips biotech from a tool to preserve yield to a tool that creates yield. And like any new frontier, it's complex, it will be a significant learning curve for everyone and it won't be as straightforward as with the agronomic traits. Because of that, the value of our collaboration with BASF is more important than ever. The complexity of the work demands scale, scale and the discovery to generate leads and massive scale in testing. So the combined capabilities of 2 of the world's preeminent R&D engines at BASF and at Monsanto give us the capability no one else can bring to bear on yield and stress. ","As the projects advance, we're building the line of sight on how to deploy them commercially. Yield-and-stress traits fit our convergence point beautifully. We see every product coming out as a part of a system of traits, germplasm and key agronomic practices. Understanding how specific traits and germplasm work in combination is critical, so you're seeing us do an increased amount of testing in the field in Phases 2 and 3 to develop reliable yield data for these systems. ","Let me start with drought-tolerant corn, this is on Slide 8, and it's a project that illustrates these points clearly. This is our most advanced yield-and-stress project in Phase 4. As you know, this product initially targets the portion of the Western Corn Belt where dry conditions are expected in most years and where drought can limit yield during the stress period. It's a relatively small market to begin with, but it will be the first drought system in the industry to have the combined tools of breeding, biotech and agronomic practices packaged for farmers. ","And importantly, we've just crossed the key milestone. At the end of last month, we received deregulation of the drought trait from the USDA. That's the final regulatory clearance we needed within the U.S. It allows us to move to on-farm testing this planting season and to complete the stacking strategy with Double PRO and Triple PRO traits. From here, the next regulatory milestone before commercial consideration is the import country approvals for the complete traits stack. Those submissions have all been made and we expect to have them in hand during the 2013, 2014 time frame. In the meantime, we're able to move forward with significant on-farm testing in our new Ground Breakers program. We have several hundred farmers who will test this integrated drought system that includes some of our best drought genetics, the biotech trait package and related agronomic practices. This program is designed to give farmers early exposure on a field scale while generating data that will help us prepare for commercial launch of the drought system. So this is a good step for our system, as well as for building an even better approach to bringing these new technologies to farmers.","If I stay within corn, our first generation higher-yielding corn advances to Phase 3 on Slide 9. Over the past several years, we've been in early phase testing. And with the second year of field testing in the lead germplasm, we've seen consistent yield benefits, as shown in the photo on the slide. And as we move into expanded testing, we're evaluating different germplasm backgrounds in more environments to develop a comprehensive set of yield data. That data helps us identify the right combinations of trait and germplasm and that will help build out the ultimate package that we would take to farmers. ","If we shift over to cotton, we have also advanced our drought-tolerant cotton project on Slide 10. This is particularly relevant because it shows the leverage we get on our technology across crop platforms. As we're developing stress tolerance traits, we've been able to apply our experience to other crops, so there's a multiplier effect. ","In our early-stage testing, we've seen good results under drought conditions. And as we expand into broader varieties, we expect to hone in on the potential commercial leads that we'll take into development. This is still a relatively early-stage project, but it's encouraging to see the proliferation of these yield-and-stress traits across more than one crop platform. ","If we shift into our agronomic pipeline, I want to focus on one of our most advanced projects, dicamba-tolerant soybeans in Phase 4 and shown on Slides 11 and 12, the biotech traits advanced phase\u2019s last year. But here's another prime example of converging technology, as the complementary chemistry that drives the ultimate dicamba weed control system just advanced on an overall path to Phase 3. This will represent the industry's first biotech herbicide-tolerant stack in soybeans. ","On the trait front, we have this lined up for our Ground Breakers program in 2013, making it the second of our key new U.S. product systems that we\u2019ll take through that program. This is another project where we've worked in conjunction with BASF as we're collaborating on new formulations of dicamba. On Slide 12, we highlight the advancement of that over-the-top new chemistry. In early studies, we've seen a reduction in volatility in our improved dicamba formulations with Roundup. In addition, these dicamba formulations make a nice addition to our system relative to other herbicide-tolerant trait systems, as our testing clearly shows dicamba has activity against a broader spectrum of weeds and our field trials are showing some residual activity compared with other chemistries, providing extended weed control. ","Dicamba also has the fewest total resistant weeds globally, so it's a system we believe will provide unmatched weed control for farmers. And it's truly a platform system. Across the Americas, the dicamba system has fit on more than a hundred million soybean acres, with an opportunity to step up weed control and create incremental value. ","Within soybeans, we also advanced our second-generation insect-protected soybean on Slide 13. Because of our experience with agronomic traits and with some accelerated multi-season test, we've been able to accelerate this project, advancing into Phase 3 this year after it was moved into Phase 2 last year. This comes on the heels of the first generation Intacta product that has been rolled out for on-farm Ground Breaker testing this year ahead of the initial commercial launch in fiscal year 2013. This second-generation approach speaks to the upgrade opportunity. ","In tropical places like Brazil, the insect infestation in soybean is particularly heavy. So the additional Bt genes we add to Intacta with this second-generation product are valuable because they will provide multiple modes of action, increasing product durability and providing the potential for refuge reduction. In addition, with an expanded spectrum of control, this second-generation product would also add protection from armyworm, another important insect pest in Brazil. ","If I shift over to corn, our Corn Rootworm III project on Slide 14 reflects that similar concerted strategy around multimode product. This is a project that's important for a couple of very key reasons. Number one, it's the first agricultural application of cutting-edge RNA interference technologies or RNAi for short. With RNAi, we're able to target and control rootworms with a novel mode of action that\u2019s outside of the class of Bt proteins that had been used in all other insect control products. In fact, RNAi offers a mode of action different from the Bt protein mechanism in our yield guard products, as well as HERCULEX rootworm, Agrisure rootworm or the recently announced Agrisure Duracade traits. ","RNAi technology leverages our genomics investments, because we identified key DNA in sequences in insects, and this technology allows us to tap into the naturally occurring machinery in the bugs to design new ways to target and control specific insects. We're the first to move the application of this technology for insect control into advanced development. And in addition to this first trait, we also have the next round of RNAi actives in the pipeline demonstrating insect control. Just as importantly, we are continuing to look at broader product applications for RNAi and we're building a broader intellectual property portfolio and further R&D capability to explore it. ","Rootworm III is also accelerating with the advancement into Phase 3. Our extensive regulatory experience and advanced product development capability will allow us to move this product aggressively through the remaining development cycle. As you compare this with our current portfolio, the performance is unprecedented. ","On the chart on the slide, you can see the 3 light green bars, which have even better control than our dual mode-of-action SmartStax products. Given the headlines that there's been on rootworm control over the last few months, we see this pipeline product as a gold standard in rootworm control and durability that will be a real game changer. ","If we shift over to cotton, we advanced 2 agronomic traits, but the one to focus on is our Lygus Control project on Slide 15. The genes we're using for this project are one of the first to come out of our advanced protein engineering capability. We invested early and built up superior capability in protein structure, protein design and directed evolution. And that's paying off because it lets us design proteins that have as much as a 90-fold increased efficacy compared to the naturally occurring Bt proteins targeting these pests. ","Most importantly, this allows us to do things that simply weren't possible 5 years ago. We've used this technology to target the category of insects we refer to as piercing and sucking bugs, like Lygus. Currently used Bt proteins do not effectively control these hemipteran insects, effectively missing a significant class of pest. Where these bugs are present, cotton growers can spend up to $30 an acre on chemical treatment, so it's clearly a valuable economic target if we can integrate it in the seed along with the current bollworm control. ","So in the interest of time, I won't cover all the projects we've advanced this year. But I'll tell you that we're making impressive progress in our canola project, in some of the other chemistry areas and in the application of markers in our vegetable platform. Now we've highlighted these in the appendix that accompanies the deck I'm using today. ","I'm going to complete our walk-through with an update on a cornerstone platform and that's breeding. I think as most of you know, we spend about half of our annual R&D budget on breeding, so we've made a conscious effort to highlight our capability here, not just because it's a significant part of the yield convergence we've discussed but because it's a critical advantage in the commercial market. Nowhere is that more evident than our yield data from the 2011 harvest highlighted on Slide 16. I covered this extensively at our Investor Day, but I want to emphasize the historic performance gains we saw this year across corn, soybeans and cotton with a couple of updates. ","Now I also understand that there's a lot of yield data that floats around after harvest and everybody claims different things, but let me make 3 points. First, we do take yield seriously, as evidenced by the thousands of comparisons in our database. And second, since our initial data review, our core yield advantages have been further supported by independent first and university trial data. And finally, if your yields are better, they should be reflected in your pricing. We just completed a study of corn pricing for the 2012 season. You see DEKALB is consistently the premium priced seed in every major area and that premium tracks very well against the yield advantage we see relative to our competitors. And to me, that's the clearest validation that our yield advantage creates real commercial value. ","One of our important updates revolves around soybeans on Slide 17. We've completed a direct comparison of Roundup Ready 2 Yield compared to the Pioneer Y Series soybeans, and Roundup Ready 2 Yield advantage of more than 4 bushels an acre was observed in greater than 5,000 comparisons across 14 states. And that tracks squarely with the yield advantage we saw against all competitors and underlines the buzz we're hearing in the countryside around Roundup Ready 2 Yield performance. ","The other big update is from our cotton results on Slide 18. Like corn and soybeans, the new cotton varieties we've launched are consistently outyielding the competitors. You can see this by geography on the chart on the slide. And when you take a weighted average total, the Deltapine land advantage is more than 6%. That's about 70 pounds of cotton per acre or more than a $60 acre advantage for Deltapine land over competitors. And that really speaks to the rapid progress we've been able to make since acquiring Deltapine land and underscores the significant gains we made as we grew volume in 2011. ","If I broaden the view in breeding, the leverage we're getting from our technology leadership is greater and there's 2 areas I want to focus on. The first is our Integrated Farming Systems on Slide 19, and this reflects the massive upgrade in the amount of data we're generating on our products. Now the idea of precision agriculture isn't new, but what we have that\u2019s absolutely unique is the knowledge of seed genetic performance under different soil conditions, different planting densities and other environmental parameters. We're able to track and correlate that data to predict how a seed will perform on different farmers\u2019 fields. It's possible to deliver prescriptions to farmers beyond the typical seed recommendations to significantly step up yield. ","Today, we're piloting prescription programs with key farmers. From there, we have our first generation of commercial products in pre-commercial prep for the Phase 4 equivalent. This would be a commercial prescription that would tie the hybrid recommendations into variable-rate planning to maximize yield. From there, we plan to roll out successive waves that increasingly leverage our massive genetic databases to tailor what a farmer plant and drive the convergence of the advances in seed, soil testing and equipment to increase yield. ","The second area where this breeding leverage is a case study is on how our marker or genome sequence capability is changing breeding on Slide 20. So historically, to target diseases, breeders had to screen through germplasm in the field or use laborious greenhouse test to identify key disease-resistance genes. We've completely revolutionized that. Today, we use high throughputs, screening and markers to identify, select and deploy disease-resistance genes. ","On Slide 24, you see how this comes together commercially. We have active disease screens that boost our annual performance and we have targeted molecular breeding projects in ways that give our portfolio an unprecedented double shot of technology to create the industry's most advanced disease tolerance program.","The elegance of this approach can be best seen in our Goss's Wilt breeding program for corn on Slide 22. Through our traditional screening process, we have hybrids in our commercial portfolio with very good Goss's Wilt's tolerance targeting the key commercial needs today. But we also complement that using our molecular breeding technology to identify specific markers for Goss's Wilt that we can scale up significantly across all of our germplasm as a targeted trait, and that expands the reach of Goss's Wilt's tolerance in our corn portfolio and we expect it to step up the level of tolerance above anything available commercially today. And you see a similar opportunity for phytophthora in soybeans on Slide 23. We're literally stacking resistance traits that couldn't have been done just a few years ago and that's translating into almost 1.5 bushel yield advantage in soybean. ","Fundamentally, it underscores that we've only scratched the surface of the capability and opportunity with breeding. In fact, I'd make the strong case that our technology lead is as important and maybe more pronounced in breeding as it is in biotechnology. ","So if you move to Slide 24, I can summarize how I think about our overall pipeline and opportunity. First, our competitive differentiator is our ability to discover, develop and deliver products that matter to farmers. We established our lead with the early investment in Seeds and Traits R&D and with the first generation of biotech traits, and we've leveraged this across multiple platforms and no one has the scale, the capability and experience that we do. ","Second, we don't take our leadership for granted. While others are playing catch-up, we're driving the next innovation in the next platforms like molecular disease breeding, RNAi and precision agriculture that take yield to the next level. ","And finally, this all comes down to yield, and we're in the best position to deliver yield to our farmer customers. Just a few short years ago, the concept of truly integrated yield would have been inconceivable. Today, with our ability to generate data and form prescriptions for the grower, we see real opportunities in integrating the seed, chemicals and equipment management on one platform that drives yield more effectively. ","So I appreciate your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bryan for the Q&A.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Robb. With that, we'd now like to open the call for questions. With this R&D update, we'll extend this Q&A session a bit. But as we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible during this time. You're always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up question. So with that, Dan, I think we're ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You talked about corn seed supply this growing season. Can you comment on your availability and whether there could be opportunities for you guys if other suppliers can't meet their customers\u2019 demand?","Hugh Grant","David, we feel good about our supply this year. You're right, there's been a lot of noise in the marketplace and I think some of the smaller companies suffered with the very warm weather and production challenges given the lack of geographic diversity. We feel good about our own position and we are ready, willing and able to supply our farmer customers. So we're in pretty good shape and we're feeling confident as we get into the season.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So your corn sales were up 46% [indiscernible] ","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is just how we should be thinking about the big bolt in your deferred revenue line which at the end of the quarter was close to $2 billion. It was $1.3 billion last year, and if I have the number right, it was $368 million a year ago. So maybe you could just talk to how much of this is just early ordering year-over-year, although I kind of member last year, it felt like orders were in a little early as well because of the attractive economics, but a $650 million build year-over-year seems like it's quite substantial relative to the move you made with your guidance.","Hugh Grant","Vincent, I'll ask Pierre maybe to give you a little bit of color. But the way I think about it, if you think -- you're right as you portray the history of this, I think it's really an indicator of strong farm income and it really speaks to the health of the business in general, the sector in general and how growers are feeling and I'm just pleased we've managed to compete for a slice of that. But Pierre, maybe you can say a few words on Vincent's question on the bulge.","Pierre Courduroux","Sure. And Vincent, you're right. I mean, it makes us feel good that the early prepays support our order book. By the same token as Hugh was saying, I mean, a big part of that is a reflection of farmer economics. And as you know, right now, I mean, there's a lot of cash at farmer level this year, so that's great and we can take advantage of that. And at the same time, from one year to the other, I mean, things are changing in the marketplace and some of those programs may be adjusted from one year to the other. So my read on that is, if anything, it\u2019s definitely favorable, supports a strong order book in the U.S. I wouldn't over read it though. I would stay fairly conservative on the read. But definitely, we're very happy to have collected that money. And as Hugh was mentioning, I mean, definitely makes us feel very comfortable with our order book today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cox of Piper Jaffray and Company.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","My first question is on Brazil. You mentioned that 3 quarters\u2019 trait penetration. Could you perhaps comment more specifically on doubles penetration?","Hugh Grant","Yes. We are -- it's kind of interesting, Michael, because we're -- doubles was the first technology advance and now -- and it went very, very quickly. Those lines went faster than our historical trend lines in the U.S. and now we're seeing the -- before we reach peak acres, we're seeing the cannibalization of those acres in new traits.","Bryan Hurley","This is Bryan. I might add to that. From a Brazil perspective, you have basically 3 packages of traits in the market today. One is the first-generation single; the second is the second-generation single, which is actually a stack; and then the third is what we would refer to as the double stack. As a percentage, that thing, that is the double stack, is very low today. So most of the upgrade has really been the first-generation single to the second-generation single. So the runway there to continue the upgrade is still present as well.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then one on SmartStax. Any supply constraints you're facing for the 2012 season? In particular, any hybrid availability issues for some of your RIB complete offerings?","Hugh Grant","No, we feel good, Michael, of the availability. And a different story from a year ago. As you get into Central Illinois, we're still a bit hybrid, but we knew that going into the season, but a different game from our first year to launch.","Robert T. Fraley","I'll just add a quick comment that we just recognized that one of the Agri Marketing magazines made our SmartStax RIB Complete product of the year, so it is quite a difference from a year or so ago and the product has performed very well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Question for Robb. Robb, you talked about Ground Breakers, I think, 3 different times. This is kind of a new approach to launching products. Is the primary benefit here that it reduces the volatility around performance and pricing as you commercialize a new product? And I know you just went through the Ground Breakers with Intacta this past fall. Can you talk about how that process went?","Robert T. Fraley","Don, yes, So we've learned a lot. The origin of the Ground Breaker program actually started after we acquired Deltapine land and we're faced with the challenge of introducing new cotton technology in the marketplace to replace the fabulously famous Triple Nickel product. And so we required a lot of grower experience and interaction to select those new cotton varieties. And that turned out to be spectacularly successful as you kind of see in the cotton breeding results we show today. And then I think with the experiences we had with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and SmartStax, we really learned that getting that exposure to growers, getting them familiar with the technology, giving us an extra bit of time to match the traits to the germplasm is critical. So we're really making that for our large major trait offerings a routine part of the introduction cycle. So as you highlighted, the Intacta product in Brazil is already in the hands of nearly 500 growers and that's going to give us a lot of information on performance and opportunity for pricing and positioning and really understanding how a more complex product with multiple genes performs in the Brazilian environment. We're going to be doing that with drought. We have several hundred growers signed up to test the integrated package of the drought gene with different corn genetics, with the agronomic traits in Double PRO and Triple PRO. That's going to be really important because that product's going to fit across a broad geography. As you know, the last couple of years, we haven't seen a lot of drought, so it's also going to be a great opportunity for us to test how the trait performs in different germplasm, so we're excited about that. And I hinted in my comments that we'll take exactly that approach when we bring the double stack of Roundup Ready 2 Yield and dicamba tolerance into the marketplace in 2013. So yes, it's an important, I think, part of how we've dealt with both the interaction of traits and genetics and how we expect to manage the complexity of these new traits in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup Inc.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Your corn sales were up 46%. Can you sort of break that down for us between price, volume and mix, and what kind of pricing do you expect in the upcoming U.S. season?","Hugh Grant","Yes, we've seen -- I mean it's still early days, P.J. But I would say, as we look at the season development, we've seen limited amounts of price discount in comparison to what we've seen in previous years. I'll maybe ask Pierre to just do a quick dissection between price, volume, mix.","Pierre Courduroux","So P.J., if you look at the first quarter numbers, as we mentioned, most of the first quarter numbers definitely are coming from South America. And at a very high level, the way I look at it personally, I mean, I would break down the growth in between what's volume-related, which would account for a little less than 50% and what's the trait expansion and the mix benefits we are seeing, plus the price benefits we are seeing with new germplasm in South America. So I would look at it as a 50-50 and obviously, when you look at the level of margins as I mentioned during the call, this is one of the reasons because of the trait expansion that we have seen our margin and percent increase from 55% to 60% in corn. So I mean, the great news is we've got headwinds both from the mix side and on the volume side in South America; the first quarter definitely is the South America quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So just one question. If RNAi is successful with rootworm, would that mean that SmartStax ends up changing, meaning that you'd pick the HERCULEX worm out of SmartStax and related, should we expect you to start applying RNAi up to aboveground pests relatively soon or is that going to take a while longer?","Pierre Courduroux","We're very excited about the RNAi technology. As you know, this was a recently discovered mechanism in biology. In fact, the original university scientists who discovered this technology received the Nobel Prize for it. We've worked on it very aggressively. You may not know that in addition to the Corn Rootworm III product, our new Vistive Gold product also utilizes the RNAi technology and will be one of the first agricultural products commercialized with it. So it's an exciting opportunity. And as I mentioned in my comments today, Rootworm III represents a really unique and novel mode of action. I think the way -- as you think through the commercial development, you've seen us stack multiple modes of action together, so it gives us the opportunity to build on the SmartStax platform, but also the opportunity to create new combinations of products for the future. And one of the things I see really exciting about the RNAi technology is that we're advancing the first product. But in our pipeline, we're testing other RNAis with different modes of action and mechanisms that are completely different. So that's very exciting and really a centerpiece of technology for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My questions relate to the vegetable platform. I think you have a goal there to grow profit to the point where it becomes the third largest contributor behind corn and soybeans. Some of the commentary this morning sounded incrementally a little bit more cautious. I think you referenced limited growth opportunity for the year. Sales and earnings were down in the quarter. Maybe can you elaborate a little bit on what is going on there and whether or not you still feel there is an opportunity to achieve that third place status, if you will, in the portfolio?","Hugh Grant","Kevin, we still see -- we mentioned this in November, we still see this having the capacity to become our third biggest platform. I think that's going to take time. I don't know if Robb's going to say a few words on markers and really -- we're very enthusiastic with the progress that we're making in new product development. I think what we're seeing this year and will -- I think Pierre's comments were cautious as we look at the projections for the remainder of the year, a big piece of that business is European, and we've seen softness in that European market. Our assumption is that's tied to the general turmoil in Europe. I think we\u2019ll be a bit smarter, come another quarter or 2. But as we look out over the year, we're a bit more conservative for our veg projections in Europe. The rest of the business is actually tracking pretty well. So I think long-term, we still see the opportunity of that becoming a third platform, we see really good advances in the technology and in product development. But as we look out over the next 2 or 3 quarters, we're going to be a little bit more conservative until we see how Europe shakes out. But I don't know if my colleagues have got anything to add to that.","Robert T. Fraley","I think the only thing I would highlight and you see it in my deck that we're just starting now to see the wave of really unique technology differentiation coming through the application markers in the vegetable platform. I think our team there, Marlin Edwards and his team, have just done a spectacular job of really bringing the new marker and sequencing technology into vegetables, and so I'm really excited about the -- starting to see the wave of pipeline advances. And I think that's really what drives the ultimate differentiation of the business for us and continues to keep it as an exciting growth platform.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As a follow-up if I may on the subject of timing issues, I heard you mention the $0.04 related to cotton in Australia. Were there any timing issues in North American Seeds and Genomics as it relates to sales and earnings impact as distinct from the prepay or cash flow impact that you referenced?","Pierre Courduroux","No. Actually, in the first quarter, the U.S. plays a very small role and we didn't see any significant change from a year-to-year in the first quarter. So really speaking about the U.S., we are mostly speaking about the order book because in the actual results, the U.S. doesn't weigh a big weight in the first quarter. So really the way to look at it is really the first quarter is South America from a corn perspective with some support from South Africa, but that's pretty much it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You have a very good preorder book, and I'm just curious to what extent do you worry that might be farmers themselves worried about availability and double ordering. I know that some of our contacts suggest there's the risk of selling substitute from some of these smaller farms that will have some challenge for you guys providing guarantees on availability. And then for Robb, it seems like for the first time in a while, with your dicamba trait in the soybean, you've actually got a competitor that is on a reasonably similar time frame, so I'm just curious if you could size up how important first mover advantage is versus the Dow Enlist product and also the fact that they've got multiple modes of herbicides instead of only 2, does that really matter?","Hugh Grant","So on the order book, we feel very good. Pierre's point -- even though it\u2019s a small quarter for the U.S., but as we look at the order book and how it's firming up, we feel very good as we go into the season. There's a lot of noise out there on seed availability. We feel confident on our ability to supply across brands and across zones. And I think the piece that\u2019s given us reassurance as we turned the year into 2012 is we passed our early December cancellation date. And as you pass that date, the order book firms significantly. So I don't see this as panic buying as much as a recognition on the yield increment that we're delivering and farmers rewarding us for that with their early commitments. But the fact that we've passed that first week in December is another level of commitment as you pass those early cancellation points. And then, Robb, maybe a few words.","Robert T. Fraley","Sure. On your question relative to some of the competitive traits, Bob. So first of all, I'd tell you upfront that 2,4-D and dicamba are both very good established broadleaf products. They\u2019re a similar oxin [ph] class of chemistry, and I think they'll both be 2 really almost brand-new tools in the context of biotech traits for growers to have access to. I think I've tried to highlight what I think the benefits of dicamba are. Basically we're working closely with BASF on new reduced volatility formulations that look very, very good in development. Some of the things that we particularly like about the dicamba chemistry are the fact that it has a very broad spectrum of all broadleaf weeds. It has very few resistant weeds that are known. And the nice thing about dicamba is that we're seeing a surprising level of residual activity, which means the farmer can put the dicamba application and then be able to control emerging weeds for several weeks afterwards, and that's a real advantage. So I think it's well positioned. I mean, we're looking at other herbicide-tolerance traits, we're combining Liberty Link and others. I think our key advantage is we're working on a program with a great chemistry, we're going to stack it with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and we're going to be doing Ground Breaker trials in 2013. So I think we have a timing advantage and I think that's terrific. And again, I can't overstate how important it is to have the ability to combine those traits with a genetic platform that has the strong performance that we're seeing out of our soybean breeding effort and out of the Asgrow brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Picken of Cleveland Research Company.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to circle back here with South America, and it seems like we've had some dry weather and some real hot weather as we've entered in the pollination season, probably more so in Argentina than Brazil. But do you think that's going to have any impact on the [indiscernible] volumes potentially in Brazil? And then secondarily, how reliant are you guys on the South American seed production? Is there any issues to some of that crop coming into the U.S.?","Hugh Grant","So 2 or 3 points. I guess the first one is, every year, we do winter production in Latin America, so we have experience in that. And you're right, Argentina is warm. It's warmer than it is in Brazil. If you look at our seed production down there, 100% of what we produce is irrigated. So it doesn't guarantee success, but it certainly mitigates the risk of dry conditions. So as we think about bringing seeds back, we feel good about our processes and our logistics, and we feel good about our production fields down there. So I think that, that kind of covers that end of it. And then if you look at production in general, Argentina's had a lot of coverage in the last few weeks. The piece that probably isn't covered as much is you look at Mato Grosso in Brazil and they\u2019re forecasting significantly higher yields. So I think Argentina, there\u2019s areas in Argentina are going to be stretched. As we look at our own seed production, we feel okay. As we look at the region in general, you have to imagine late June, July in the U.S., and that's kind of the timing we\u2019re at right now, so you\u2019re right, it's a squeeze right around the time of pollination but from our own physical production, we feel good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Cash of UBS.","Andrew W. Cash - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on soybeans. Pioneer's been out there dotting the Midwest with these bulk bins about every 15 to 20 miles, and their customers are claiming that it's convenient for them to make seed pickups and it lowers their cost of seed treatment. I'm just curious what\u2019s Monsanto's answer to Pioneer's program.","Hugh Grant","We -- our focus in this really has been -- our focus in this really, Andy, has been on delivering better beans that provide better yield. And logistics is one component, but I think genetics, at the end of the day, makes a really big difference. I don't know, Robb, if you got any answer.","Robert T. Fraley","No. I mean, I think that's the key. In the end, the yield advantage we're seeing with our Roundup Ready 2 Yield technology and the ability to stack with dicamba is great. But I think the other point that I just ought to emphasize is, as you look at our strategy and both our licensed genetic platforms and our brands, we have -- our retailers and dealers are also doing bulk availability of beans, so I don't really see that as a differentiator at all.","Andrew W. Cash - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But just as a follow-on, Pioneer has been pretty successful with their value pricing strategy in beans and so far, they haven't signed up for the Roundup Ready 2 Yield license. So I'm just curious, if that continues to be the case, are you going to have to rethink your pricing strategy around Roundup Ready 2 Yield beans?","Hugh Grant","I mean, we've -- it's so speculative, Andy, because as we sit here today, DuPont hasn't made that step in license in Roundup Ready 2 Yield. I've been very clear in the last year that our stall is open and we'd be very happy to have them as a licensee. We've made that offer but they've never closed that deal. I'll tell you, the way that we think about this isn't from the perspective of what kind of bag or what kind of box you deliver it in, we feel good about where we are in our bulk delivery systems. What the grower\u2019s looking for at the end of the day is who delivers more bushels. And when you look particularly in the environment at the moment where commodity price are, and you look at the switch that's occurred in the last 24 -- well, actually 36 months now on the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform, I think the results speak for themselves. So the grower's going to look for performance. He's going to look at optimizing every acre he has and it's our job to get the best possible genetics and the best possible performance out there. And that's how we're thinking about the run-up for this spring.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just have a two-part question there. First question is to Robb in that your nitrogen uptake for corn, your nitrogen utilization trait, didn't advance this time. And I was wondering whether you were running into some obstacles in that program. And if you were, what were they? And then the second part is, to go back to a previous question or your deferred revenues are up about 50% year-over-year or about $660 million. So I was wondering why that rate of growth didn't really translate into an appreciable change in your earnings outlook.","Hugh Grant","So Robb, maybe a couple of words on nitrogen. I think nitrogen advanced the [indiscernible].","Robert T. Fraley","Yes, Jeff. If you look at the slide, you'll see that it advanced phase last year, so we're pleased with the progress. In fact, we've, this year, studied a number of second-, third-, fourth-generation nitrogen leads. This is an area where the research is quite active and we're excited about the early results.","Hugh Grant","And then on the deferred piece, I\u2019ll maybe defer the deferral to Pierre. But Jeff, just a couple of words on philosophy, we've -- the first quarter's 10% a year, we get 90% to play for. But I'll tell you, if I look at the order book, if I look at what's happened in Latin America, I feel very good at how the year's panning out and I also feel good about the move that was made to the upper end of our guidance. So maybe you're looking for more but I think where we're sitting, I think is exactly the right stance to take. But Pierre on the deferral again, just...","Pierre Courduroux","So speaking back to the deferred revenues on the balance sheet, I mean, really, as we said, a big factor in those deferred revenue is the amount of available cash at farm gate. I mean, that's really where the key driver of those prepays is. What is great is that it definitely supports our order book, and that's really the way we look at it. And that's why we feel extremely good about it, collecting the cash, having the vote from farmers, at the same time, we don't consider that yet as a significant upside. I mean, this is really -- we look at it more in terms of a cash flow management from the farmer's side and a vote of confidence at the same time.","Bryan Hurley","This is Bryan. With the extended Q&A here, I think we're still running with a few minutes. Why don't we take 2 more questions before we let Mr. Grant wrap up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Robb, you were talking about the drought-tolerant corn that you got the USDA approvals last month. And then, as you're looking to commercialize this in the 2013, 2014 time frame, you need to get the international regulatory stack approvals as well. Can you talk a little bit more about the process involved, the countries and the expected timing, where you need to get those international approvals?","Robert T. Fraley","Sure. So on the -- with the U.S. approval, that gives us the ability this year to put the seed out into the U.S. market and to do our test with growers, which is a great advantage and lets us follow up on larger scale testing of the trait and the genetic packages. And then to the heart of your question, for many of the import countries, the data packages for the ultimate product have to be based on all the integrated traits. So once you get the approval for the D1 gene and it's now stacked as you would commercially with the Double PRO or Triple PRO product, we need import country approvals for all of the traits as a stack package. So we've submitted those, but those take additional time. And in some cases, the clock doesn't start until you get the deregulation of the drought gene in the U.S. in certain countries and regulation, so that's what's going on. And then over the course of the rest of 2012, 2013, as we go into 2014, we'll achieve the full set of international approvals and be able to go into launch of the integrated product package.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you think that it might be a situation where it takes through 2013 in order to get the full approvals? I'm just trying to gauge the likeliness of a commercial launch in '13 versus '14.","Robert T. Fraley","It depends on the final countries and timing. But generally, we would expect to have everything done in '13.","Operator","And our final question comes from Elaine Yip of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Elaine Yip - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With some farmers experiencing issues when they continue with corn and with some of the bug resistant headlines that popped up over the past few months, have you seen any changes in farmer behavior as to what crop they intend to plant this year? What hybrids to use? What chemicals to apply?","Hugh Grant","Elaine, I'll maybe let Robb say a few words. But I'll tell you, as I've traveled and I've done some of the sessions in the countryside with growers this year, they are focused on optimizing profitability, and it's maybe changed the way that they're looking at incorporating insecticide into some of those programs. But in general, they are selecting the hybrids and they're selecting the best possible technology practices to drive yield, so we haven't seen the shift there. The acreage involved in this is 0.5% or less, it's a very, very small area. But I'd say that the closer you get to the farm, the more aware they are and the more practical -- the more practical the approach to driving solutions around us. But it's much more a mitigation -- it's more a mitigation and insurance approach than anything else. But Robb, I don't know if you have anything to add.","Robert T. Fraley","No. I really can't add much, I mean, other than we actually are sitting down with corn growers. This is not an item that comes up. I mean, corn growers like to talk about what's going on with ethanol subsidies or with corn prices, but I get very little feedback on rootworm, and that's because such a small percentage of the corn production has dealt with any rootworm issues. There's a tremendous amount of excitement with the SmartStax, RIB Complete and the Double PRO RIB products. So we certainly haven't seen any changes reflected either in the order book or in grower purchases.","Hugh Grant","Yes, and I guess that would be the final validation point to Robb's last point. If we look at the composition on order book and we look at our projections on the RIB family and our triple stacks, it really -- it tracks exactly in line with where we were projecting, which is kind of validation in terms of how our customers are purchasing them.","Thanks very much for the questions. And I think Bryan and I will -- just a few very brief words to respect your time. I think in closing, on behalf of all of us here at Monsanto, we'd wish you a happy and a healthy new year, and thank you for your support and for joining us this morning. ","As I mentioned in my opening comments, this was a -- this first quarter was a strong quarter, and that gives us the data points that reinforce the 2012 opportunity and the drivers that we see in continued growth. In the near-term, we're seeing momentum from the growing Latin American opportunity, and we featured that in our November Investor Day and it's really playing out in this quarter. But we also see the opportunity in our corn business in the U.S. And that's reflected in our confidence in delivering at the high end of our original EPS guidance expectations. ","Beyond this year, we've increased our focus on becoming the yield company, delivering valuable yield to our grower customers. That shows in our strategy, it shows in our products and it shows in the pipeline that Robb shared with you today. What matters most to growers is yield. And I tell you that I believe we're in the best position today to deliver that yield. We're extending our competitive lead and that's what drives our opportunity to serve our farmer customers.

The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","We plan to take a slightly different approach this morning on our format, so to kick us off, I\u2019ll hand it over to Hugh. Hugh?","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Laura. Good morning to those on the phone and thanks very much for joining us today. Today, in a departure from our previous calls, I\u2019d like to open with a few brief comments and then pass it Pierre, who will address our third quarter results and the outlook for the year, followed by the operational outlook for fiscal year \u201917 and beyond with Brett. At the end of this call, I\u2019ll close by covering our longer term strategic view and my perspective on our unique integrated solutions vision for agriculture.","But first, let me address the Bayer proposal and other strategic alternatives directly. Over the past several weeks with the support of our board and advisors, I have personally been in discussions with Bayer\u2019s management regarding this proposal, along with others regarding other strategic alternatives. Regarding Bayer specifically, there is no formal update at this point. We\u2019ve said that we remain open and we believe that our efforts and continued constructive dialog could allow our joint teams to explore potential next steps. ","While any value discussion is more complex given the fact that the industry is running at a low point in the ag cycle, we recognize the potential value these types of combinations create as they accelerate innovation and increase choice for farmers across a broader set of crops, geographies and production practices while improving the sustainability of agriculture around the world. We continue to believe in the value potential of the right combination.","Of course, there can be no assurance that these discussions will lead to any transaction, or on what terms. It\u2019s clear that Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this industry, and I assure you that we\u2019ll continue to actively explore these opportunities and pursue value enhancing strategic options.","Our belief in the long-term opportunity is unchanged and our growth prospects beyond fiscal year \u201916, with our without a deal, remain strong. The global ag cycle is at a low point, and we\u2019ve seen a series of recent economic and political challenges. These are huge events around the world that create instability. Today, however, we see potential for positive resolution on the horizon for some of these challenges, particularly for our Argentinean soybean business, for our Round-Up Ready Xtend soybean blockbuster, and the recent announcement on re-registration of glyphosate in Europe. As this tide turns, and turn it will, with the changes that we\u2019ve made to our business, we\u2019ll be well positioned to strengthen our leadership role in this space with our financial discipline and our steadfast commitment to innovation.","With that, let me pass it to Pierre.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks Hugh, and good morning to everyone. Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter, given the events that Hugh alluded to, as a company we\u2019ve remained focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary actions to set the stage for future growth, as illustrated by the following. We have stayed true to our philosophy of pricing to the value of our innovation. We have delivered on significant strategic portfolio management and licensing commitments, resulting in an approximate $370 million EBIT contribution for this fiscal year, as compared to $274 million in 2015. We are tracking very well towards our restructuring plan savings at a cost now closer to the low end of the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion while transforming and modernizing the way we work, and we have delivered on our capital allocation commitments.","This demonstrates our ability to maintain our focus on the variables we control despite an unprecedented level of challenges affecting our business. These actions set us up nicely for momentum going into the anticipated rebound in the ag cycle, with an expected return to growth in earnings per share in fiscal year \u201917 which accelerates to a mid-teens earnings per share growth rate from fiscal year \u201917 to \u201921. With that, let\u2019s focus on the here and now and review our third quarter results, as shown on Slide 4 and 5. ","On a net reported basis, our third quarter earnings per share is $1.63, reflecting $0.54 for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters, and a charge for Argentine-related tax matters. The Argentine-related tax matter resulted in a charge of $219 million, which refers primarily to a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, mostly driven by recent cumulative losses in our Argentine subsidiary. With growth in the business, we would expect to see this allowance reverse partially or in full over time. On an ongoing basis, this translates into $2.17 of earnings per share. ","Although partly offset by the benefits of share repurchases and increased row crop licensing EBIT contributions, we encountered several headwinds in the quarter. These included the expected absence of last year\u2019s Scotts licensing agreement and the anticipated glyphosate pricing declines, but also Round-Up Ready Xtend-related costs and lower soybean volumes amplified by the delayed EU import approval, as well as lower cotton gross profit in India arising from pricing regulations and declines in planted acres. Finally, our free cash flow year-to-date is a use of $224 million as compared to a use of $789 million in the prior year, reflecting strong working capital management.","From a year-to-date perspective, our seeds and genomics gross profit margin as a percent of net sales was nearly flat at 62%. Global corn gross profit margin was down just slightly as increased COGS from lower production plans combined with discounting to counter competitive offers more than offset the mixed leaf benefit from new hybrid introductions and price increases in local currency in regions like Brazil. In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined approximately 3 percentage points primarily as a result of costs associated with the Round-Up Ready Xtend launch, which were amplified by the delayed European import approval. These more than offset the pricing benefit from increased Intacta penetration that was partly masked by the weak real at a critical point in the season. Our cotton business gross profit margin reduction was due primarily to Indian pricing controls that were enacted in the third quarter of this fiscal year, while vegetable margins improved due to lower costs arising from better operations. Finally, our other crop segment margins improved with closure of the alfalfa licensing deal with Forage Genetics. Moving to ag productivity, gross profit margins declined due to the lower Round-Up pricing and the absence of the $274 million licensing deal with Scotts. ","Looking forward, we are seeing signs of a positive resolution for several of the headwinds we\u2019ve been tracking. First, the EU Commission just affirmed that an 18-month extension of the existing authorization for glyphosate use would be completed by the June 30 deadline. In addition, we anticipate the receipt of the EU import approval for Round-Up Ready Xtend stack shortly thereafter, and finally Argentina announced an interim policy that supports mandatory testing for Intacta, leaning into what we expect to be a strong start for our southern hemisphere businesses. However, despite these positive developments and expectations, with the results of the third quarter we now expect to be at the low end of our ongoing fiscal year \u201916 earnings per share range of $4.40 to $5.10, which assumes approximately $0.85 of currency headwinds. After the inclusion of the Argentine-related tax matters and the favorable change in the expected amount and timing of restructuring expense, this translates into a full-year as-reported earnings per share guidance at the low end of an adjusted range of $3.36 to $4.14.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the individual components within our 2016 guidance, as shown on Slide 6. First, with recent revisions, we expect seeds and genomics gross profit to be down just under 5% for the full year. Importantly, exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $350 million, seeds and genomics gross profit is anticipated to be flat to up slightly. Practically, on a currency-neutral basis we expect the benefit of the alfalfa license, increased Intacta penetration and global corn volumes to offset the roughly $150 million impact of the Round-Up Ready Xtend soybean-related costs and share loss, the impact of the pricing controls in Indian cotton and declines in planted acres there. ","Of the approximately $370 million of EBIT benefit from licensing and strategic deals expected in fiscal year \u201916, we recorded approximately $210 million in gross profit, reflecting the one-time upfront fee related to our alfalfa traits and technology license to Forage Genetics International. We expect the remainder of the EBIT benefit, which is mostly derived from the expected $145 million gain from the sorghum joint venture and plant sale to be recorded in other income in the fourth quarter. Our ag productivity gross profit outlook is now trending towards the lower end of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion as earlier estimates had assumed one of our smaller licensing and asset sale deals would benefit gross profit, but was ultimately recorded in other income. For the full year, we continue to expect to see a higher ratio of branded Round-Up volume as compared to the prior fiscal year; however, we expect that full-year volumes will be below our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity, but not to the point of generating material volume variances.","From a price perspective, our competitive intelligence leads us to believe that we are nearing the bottom for genetic glyphosate pricing in the market, and we are not expecting significant moves from this point forward. We remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year \u201916, primarily benefiting operating expenses. These savings combined with spending discipline and currency benefits contributes to our expectation that even after increased investments in new platforms, we expect to see operating spend down slightly before estimated restructuring charges and environmental and litigation matters. ","Assuming the Argentine peso exchange rate remains close to a ratio of 1:14 at the close of the fiscal year, we now expect our expense net to be relatively flat year-over-year as the nearly $180 million impact from the devaluation in Argentina is now being offset by gains on non-core asset sales of approximately $170 million.","Our tax rate is expected to increase to 32 to 34% for the full year, inclusive of Argentine-related tax matters. Looking out to fiscal year \u201917, we expect our tax rate to be more in the range of 25 to 27%, which is more aligned to recent prior years. Finally, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases, including net financing expense, should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.20 to $0.25, with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our third quarter.","Consistent with our updated earnings projections and based on the possible slight delay in the close of the sale of the Precision Ag Equipment business to John Deere, we now adjusted our free cash flow guidance for the year to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, as shown on Slide 7. At the peak of our working capital cycle and after the successful execution of the $3 billion accelerate share repurchase in the second quarter, our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio sits at 2.6 at the close of the third quarter. We expect this to revert to a ratio in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 at the end of the fiscal year, following strong expected collections. ","Looking ahead to fiscal year \u201917 and assuming relatively stable foreign currencies, we expect a return to growth in earnings per share, as shown on Slide 8. As we shared at Q2, our expectation is that our long term growth would not be linear, with next year marking a slower pace as we recover and reset the trajectory with the early days of Round-Up Ready Xtend penetration. This expected growth is driven by the continued penetration of our soybean blockbusters, the durability of our global corn platform, and an improved cost of goods outlook for both corn and soybeans. ","From a year-over-year perspective, this growth is expected to be partially offset by declining glyphosate pricing, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year \u201917, by a lower level of non-core licensing deals, and by a slight increase in spend with inflation and expected increases in commissions and incentives offsetting the benefits from our restructuring plan. We also expect a more normalized effective tax rate of 25 to 27% for the coming fiscal year. Once we get a better line of sight on the closure of the northern hemisphere crop season and finalize our operational plans, we will provide a more refined outlook for \u201917.","Beyond fiscal year \u201917, the opportunities significantly accelerate as the growth drivers of \u201917 are expected to expand, continuing to generate the best margins among our ag peers with streamlined operations and portfolio advantages driving our multi-layered growth into the next decade. We continue to target a mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share from fiscal year \u201917 now advancing to fiscal year \u201921 from fiscal year \u201919, as we moved our long-range plan a notch forward. Practically, our estimated EPS for fiscal year \u201919 has not changed significantly from our previous guidance. We are now simply expanding the horizon.","In closing, our financial focus remains consistent: return on innovation, financial discipline, and balanced capital allocation. These together with a sound and disciplined approach delivering on our integrated solutions strategy supports long-term growth and industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital, as shown on Slide 9.","With that, I will pass it to Brett to walk through the operational outlook. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thanks Pierre, and good morning to everyone on the line. While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering against the milestones that set a foundation for rapid growth, and importantly with an optimized operating cost structure. This focus is balanced across our broad portfolio and key growth drivers, as outlined on Slide 10, whether it is our seed business, crop protection or climate, all of which I\u2019ll update you on today in our outlook for fiscal year \u201917.","Let\u2019s begin with soybeans on Slide 11. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption rates toward their target opportunity, with both Intacta and Round-Up Ready 2 Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a meaningful step-up in penetration next year. Let\u2019s start with the 100 million acre insect protection opportunity in South America, where we are on a good path to penetrate 75 million acres by fiscal year \u201919. ","After achieving an expected 35 million acres of Intacta Round-Up Ready 2 Pro technology penetration across South America this year, we now believe that Intacta will be planted on 45 to 55 million acres in South America in fiscal year \u201917. A royalty collection system in Argentina that operates consistently and with integrity would move us to the high end of that range.","Moving to Round-Up Ready 2 Xtend soybeans on Slide 12, we now estimate that our introduction this year is just above 1 million acres across our brands and licensees. Despite the repeated delays on the EU import approval, which we expect shortly, we know that farmers want the technology and we\u2019re producing aggressively to be in a strong position for the coming selling season. To that end, our brands and licensees have plans in place to supply roughly 15 million acres of Round Up Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in fiscal year \u201917. In addition, we expect roughly $150 million of incremental cost and soybean share losses related to the launch and subsequent delays in the EU import approval to decrease by two-thirds next year. ","To enable the full benefits of the system, there is also good progress on the herbicide approvals as well. The EPA\u2019s public comment period for the over-the-top use of dicamba herbicide closed late last month, and we\u2019re happy to share that to date of the more than 850 comments posted so far, more than 75% of those are comments from growers, dealers, academics and others in support of the new use. The EPA has indicated they expect to conclude the process for approval of the label for in-crop use of dicamba formulations by late summer to early fall.","Our plans to enable a reliable supply of those dicamba formulations at our Luling, Louisiana facility continue, and in the interim we have supply agreements in place to meet the demand for what we envision will be the number two molecule in crop protection behind glyphosate.","From a global corn perspective, as shown on Slide 13, the factor that stands out is the durability of the portfolio in a challenging environment. This is illustrated by the expectation that we held or grew our global genetic share. Although our global germplasm price mix excluding currency is expected to be down slightly for this fiscal year with anticipated stable to improving corn acres and commodity prices, we expect to see global price mix lift move to the positive in fiscal year \u201917. As we finalize our price guards, we\u2019ll share more. This lift is then expected to accelerate in later years due to performance from breeding gains. We also expect improved cost of goods from more normalized seed production plans, leading to a significant reduction in the $90 million to $100 million of headwind we experienced this year.","As we review by region, let\u2019s look first at the U.S. We expect planted acres to be in the range of 91 to 92 million acres, and we expect to grow our genetic share on that footprint, delivering the second highest year of U.S. corn sales volume in the history of the company. With new generations from our advanced breeding programs and the next generations of corn insect control traits coming from SmartStax Pro and Trecepta towards the end of this plan, our U.S. business looks promising. ","In Europe, with an estimated eight points of share gain the past eight years, we look forward to continuing to be the fastest growing corn seed brand in the region. In Argentina, with an expected lift in commodity prices and reduction in export taxes, we believe that corn acres in the country could increase greater than 20%. Given our historic share in Argentina corn, this bodes well for the season ahead and beyond. In Brazil, we also see the outlook improving. We expect that acres planted to corn will increase in the mid-single digits and that the ramp-up of VT Triple Pro traited hybrids will continue again in 2017, as farmers trade up to better insect control. I\u2019m also pleased to share that for the upcoming summer season in Brazil, we expect double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency coming on the back of 20%-plus price increases in Brazil for fiscal year \u201917, offsetting some of the currency downside.","Other notable developments occurred in our complementary crops, as outlined on Slide 14. I\u2019ll begin with our U.S. cotton business. The latest addition to that portfolio is Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton in its second year of launch. We expect it to be on about 3 million acres in the U.S. this year, or four times last year\u2019s acres. With strong farmer demand for Bollgard II XtendFlex and our new cotton varieties, we expect to gain three or more brand share points this year, or six points in the last two years. Our vegetable business is also experiencing positive momentum and operational excellence. We\u2019re managing supply well, now boasting the lowest inventory in seven years while delivering nice GP growth exclusive of currency. ","In our ag productivity segment, we\u2019re maintaining our emphasis on cost discipline and portfolio optimization. As we near the anticipated bottom of the generic pricing cycle here in the fourth quarter, we expect the pricing comparison for the first half of next fiscal year to be a headwind; however, this should be partially moderated by some expected volume recovery for the full year.","Let\u2019s transition to climate, as shown on Slide 15. Last month, we provided an update that highlighted how we were on track for our targeted penetration of more than 12 million paid acres. That number is now expected to be more than 13 million paid acres for fiscal year \u201916. Overall, we are seeing paid offerings up more than 2.5 times versus prior year and now expect to continue that momentum into fiscal year \u201917, with targeted penetration of 25 million acres with paid services, nearly doubling this year\u2019s results. It\u2019s clear that farmers are seeing the value that the Climate FieldView platform provides, and that step-up to paid acres builds from the total platform footprint for the technology which is also ahead of target at more than 92 million acres. More than 75% of those platform acres are with growers who are monthly active users of our digital tools. ","In addition to strong product penetration results, recent farmer survey results indicate that growers now identify the Climate FieldView platform as the number one digital ag brand in the industry. Global expansion of Climate FieldView is also on track with a pre-launch in Brazil this fall and a launch in eastern Canada in the spring of 2017. Climate has now forged partnerships across more than 10 retail, software and equipment platforms with these relationships serving as yet another strategic differentiator. One of the significant agreements is with John Deere, and we\u2019re on track to launch our in-cab connectivity offering with Deere\u2019s new wireless data server technology for the 2016 fall harvest. ","In our other new technology platform, led by our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, we\u2019re testing microbes this year on a scale that\u2019s unmatched in the industry. At the same time, we are preparing for the launch of our first alliance microbial seed treatment for corn, which demonstrated a greater than four bushel average yield advantage in fiscal year \u201915 field trials. This upstream corn inoculant will be marketed under the Acceleron brand in the U.S. and as Jumpstart Xl in remaining geographies. As this product expands to addition crops, it has the potential to penetrate approximately 100 million acres by 2025, making it one of the largest biological products in the ag industry. ","Last but not less important is an update on our continued spend discipline, as outlined in Slide 16. Our savings are on track and with lower estimated cost, we\u2019re looking to continue to drive efficiency through the business. We continue to track towards the expected $500 million of savings from our restructuring and cost savings initiatives by fiscal year \u201918, reaching an expected $375 million to $420 million by fiscal year \u201917. ","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Hugh.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Brett. I\u2019ll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view of what\u2019s to come hasn\u2019t changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there is one unwavering constant, which is our commitment to an integrated solution strategy that brings seeds, traits, chemistry and data science tools to farmers around the world. We are uniquely placed with our seed position and our digital ag platform with Climate. We believe that this strategy will create tremendous value for society, for farmers, and for our owners as outlined on Slide 17, and the world is going to need it. The long-term demand trends remain robust and are reinforced by the most recent WASDE report. It indicates that year-over-year global demand growth for soybeans and corn continues to be strong, with another billion bushels of corn needed for the year ahead. Beyond that, we see robust demand continuing for decades to come. ","The need to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable intensification of agronomic solutions remains a global priority. We continue to see innovation in agriculture as being the answer to satisfy these demand curves, as well as the differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres. We are best positioned to answer that need. Our leadership in this area is evidenced by the industry\u2019s most proven pipeline, one with up to $25 billion in expected peak net sales and core platforms alone. ","By better integrating these technological advances, this approach will allow farmers to maximize yield, minimize risk, improve sustainability, and optimize their overall profit. It\u2019s about selecting the right seeds, traits, and weed, insect and disease control, with accurate data insights so that farmers can manage their operations not just acre by acre by increasing row by row. ","It\u2019s our unique innovation platform that underpins our own strong standalone growth plan as well as the industrial logic for Bayer\u2019s proposal to acquire Monsanto, as shown on Slide 18. It starts with our leading seed and trait platform that reaches more than 400 million acres globally and strong and leading germplasm share in corn, soybean, cotton and vegetables globally. We\u2019re the world\u2019s largest seller of seed applied solutions. We\u2019re enhancing our Acceleron seed treatments with plans for a new Phase 4 nematicide, Nemastrike, as well as with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes. Finally, Climate has emerged as the digital ag platform driven by fundamental competitive advantages. Climate uniquely combines core data and software capabilities, broad commercial reach, and unprecedented adoption, all of which we\u2019ll continue to build as the integrating hub for seeds, traits and chemistries, and that\u2019s clearly recognized by others in our industry.","To further expand the value of this innovation platform, our technology organization has moved forward with unprecedented trials of next-generation technology in the lab and in the field. Overall, this is stacking up to another stellar year with projections of this being the fourth year in a row with more than 20 phase advancements. You\u2019ll get the chance to see our next wave of innovation at Whistlestop on August 17 and 18, so mark your calendars to plan to join us for this event.","To further enhance our unique position to deliver the integrated solution strategy, we\u2019re continually optimizing our portfolio, as shown on Slide 19. As a part of this optimization and further bolstering our position as the partner of choice in innovation, we\u2019ve recently entered several distinct technology agreements. Some contribute directly to the bottom line in fiscal year \u201916, and importantly they all contribute to our long-term vision, so let\u2019s take a quick look at some of the most significant agreements.","We just announced that DuPont Pioneer is a new licensee of the Intacta trait stack pending Brazil approvals, which is yet another endorsement of the strength of this rapidly penetrating technology. We exclusively licensed our alfalfa traits and technologies to Forage Genetics International, and we\u2019re in the process of forming a strategic joint venture with Remington Holding Company to more effectively manage our elite sorghum germplasm assets. Both transactions unlock value and create R&D focus while still generating new technologies for our grower customers in a collaborative manner. ","We also recently negotiated and signed several gene editing agreements that coupled with our own internally developed proprietary technologies are expected to accelerate and enhance the drive to the next generation of seed and trait solutions. Finally, consistent with our collaborative approach to new chemistry solution development, as shown on Slide 20, we announced a new agreement with Sumitomo Chemical Company to establish future generation weed control trait stacks in several crops. It features a new PPO chemistry paired with the related tolerance gene that not only overcomes weed resistance issues but also controls problematic weeds. Importantly, this new herbicide and trait are being developed in parallel, allowing farmers to access the benefits of this technology earlier than a more traditional sequential development approach. We plan to announce other chemistry collaborations in the near future as we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to drive returns on our innovation and align our portfolio to our integrated solutions vision.","Pierre touched on this earlier, and as I wrap up, I think it bears repeating - our continued commitment to operate as the most innovative company in this space with a foundation of disciplined spend and portfolio management will position us well for the expected rebound in our industry. Many in this industry have theorized on integrated strategies, but we believe we\u2019re the best positioned to make this strategy a reality. With our truly unique asset position in traits, seeds and digital ag, as well as our pace and our breadth of proven innovation, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for agriculture while continuing to deliver industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital across our peer set, along with strong cash flow to fuel future growth, as shown on Slide 21. Quite simply, this is what makes partnering with Monsanto today such an attractive, unique proposition.","So with that, Laura, let\u2019s move to the Q&A section.","Laura Meyer","Thank you. With that, we\u2019d now like to open the call for questions. Dr. Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer, has also joined us for today\u2019s Q&A. As we typically do, I\u2019ll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You\u2019re always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up.","Christine, I think we\u2019re ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Thank you. Hugh, a question on your outlook for 2017. Last quarter you talked about a return to rapid growth in \u201917, you talked of an earnings snapback. Now, you seem to be downplaying that a bit. I\u2019m just wondering what is it that\u2019s changed in your outlook, because both currency and sort of grain price headwinds seem to be turning in your favor.","Hugh Grant","Yes Don, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll maybe ask Pierre to categorize or put it in a few buckets, but we\u2019re taking a little bit of a cautious approach until we see how the year plays out. Pierre, maybe if you look at the dissolution of some of these headwinds and then some of the plus points that are emerging?","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, and actually entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into \u201918 and \u201919, and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds definitely. So Intacta traits on 44 to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this is our assumption today and the demand in the market is still very strong, so we see this one as a key driver for growth. We also anticipate Xtend on 15 million acres next year, so that\u2019s also something that will carry us into \u201917 with momentum. We also anticipate that some of the headwinds we have this year, we said one--that two-thirds of the headwinds we\u2019ve been seeing this year related to launch of Xtend will disappear, so that\u2019s about $100 million of benefit we are anticipating next year. We also mentioned cost of good momentum in both corn and soy, and there again around $100 million there, and the return to positive pricing in corn. ","On top of that, obviously there is the--our assumption right now is we\u2019re not going to be seeing devalution in Argentina comparable to what we\u2019ve seen this year, so these are done, all the positive elements that we see as building momentum entering into \u201917.","However, we have to balance those with a couple of other things we are actually watching at this point in time. What we expect is that we will have a tough comparison in glyphosate, mostly in the first part of the year. Our anticipation is that glyphosate pricing is going to stay pretty much where it is right now, and if you look at the first half of fiscal year \u201916, we enjoyed pricing way higher than where they are, so we anticipate this one to be a tough comp for us entering into \u201917.","The other element that we highlighted today is that from a deal perspective, so this year we have the benefit of $370 million in deals, we are not anticipating at this point in time, based on the portfolio of opportunities we have in front of us, that the deals are going to be of that magnitude next year, and we\u2019ll give a little more clarity on that when we have our operations plans in place. Tax rate will also be a little more challenging next year, based on what we are looking at right now, and we also have to balance the benefit of our restructuring actions with inflationary increases, increased commissions based on the success of our channel model in the U.S. and obviously South America, and also incentives. So if you add to that the impact of India on our cotton business, these are the things we want to clarify, and that\u2019s why as you mentioned, we wanted to be cautious entering into \u201917, although as you mentioned we also see a lot of tailwinds there.","Don Carson","So if you put that all together, what would that translate into, sort of high single digit earnings growth, or do you think you can get to double digit earnings growth next year?","Pierre Courduroux","So Don, at this point in time we don\u2019t want to give an absolute number at this point in time, and what we mentioned in our prepared remarks is we\u2019ll come back to you as soon as our operational plans are in place.","Don Carson","Okay, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","PJ Juvekar","You know, if you look at your grower customers in the downturn, they seemed unwilling to pay for the premium seed or sort of innovation, as they seem to have traded down in seed technology this year. So do you think that they\u2019re willing to pay for premium, or the premium pricing only in the upturn and maybe they sort of trade down in the downturn?","Hugh Grant","PJ, thanks for your question. I\u2019ll maybe ask Brett to say a few words. I think our observation over the last 15 years has been growers need innovation in good years and bad, and the seed that we sell out of first is our best performer. The quantum in that premium changes over those years, but the compromise and reaching for mediocre or average seed doesn\u2019t--that doesn\u2019t play out.","Brett, maybe a few words on the refresh on our portfolio and how we see that in \u201917?","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think--PJ, good morning. If you think about our highest premium product that we sell across the U.S., it\u2019s our SmartStax products, and as we look at this year, SmartStax is going to make up a similar percentage to our overall business as it did last year, so I do not see farmers trading down. We have farmers on the fringes of rootworm areas that may trade down, but it\u2019s not material.","We had to make some adjustments in our pricing ladder that we talked about last year to adjust for the significant pullback in the commodity price, of which now we\u2019re seeing rebound a little bit, and we had to address some of the competitive issues in the marketplace, which we did, I would argue, very effectively and that\u2019s why I\u2019m confident today to say that I actually think for genetic share, we\u2019re up, and for brand share we held our own in the marketplace. ","So I feel really good about how we ended up in the U.S. corn business, and when I look to South America, boy, farmers are not slowing down, down there at all. We\u2019re seeing--we took significant price increases in corn last year in Brazil. We\u2019re doing it again this year. Now, granted it\u2019s a currency offset and it\u2019s not offsetting all of it, but farmers are quickly moving to our new Triple Pro in Brazil to get better bug control. So I think even in these challenging times, farmers look for the best seed and the best traits to drive productivity on their farm, and they need it more than ever. I think we see that this year - you know, it\u2019s really disappointing that we ended up with the ongoing delays with the EU, but I have to tell you, farmers were lined up to buy the Xtend technology this year, and I\u2019m really optimistic about that one next year.","So tough conditions do not slow down farmers\u2019 appetite, as Hugh said. They\u2019re looking for ways to drive productivity and profitability.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you, Brett. You mentioned earlier, I think, $150 million of headwind due to delays in Xtend. Is that what mainly contributed to third quarter weakness in soy, or was there something else? Thank you.","Pierre Courduroux","So PJ, this is Pierre. It definitely was a big part of the third quarter impact from soybeans. There were a couple of other elements, and the key one is an element of timing. If you remember last year when we entered into the fourth quarter, so at the end of the third quarter, everybody in the market was looking at the soybean market. The expectation was 85 million acres, and the market ended up being 83, so you saw a lot of returns in the third quarter. Right now, people are looking at the market more in the range of 82 million, so this is--also this element of timing, the huge return that happened last year at the end of the fourth quarter, that\u2019s also driving some of the comps when you\u2019re looking at the Q3. But definitely the delay in Xtend from a cost perspective but also from a share perspective has been a big impact for third quarter.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you, good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning, David.","David Begleiter","Hugh, how are you and the board balancing the strong rationale for an integrated solutions in ag seeds and chemicals versus potentially selling the company at the bottom of the ag cycle?","Hugh Grant","Yes, thanks David for the question. As I\u2019m sure you understand, there\u2019s a limit to what I can talk about because these have been private conversations, but let me try and give you a little bit of the landscape to the last piece of your point. I think it is complex because we\u2019re at the low point of the ag cycle, and I think in the tone and some of the comments today, we see some of the early signs of this cycle beginning to turn. As we look at the Bayer proposal and as we examine some of the other strategic alternatives that have emerged, I\u2019m personally engaged in those discussions along with the board, the support of the board and our advisors, and I would say this gets down to two things. It gets down to value and it gets down to certainty, so we\u2019re convinced--the longer this runs, we\u2019re convinced in the value of that integrated strategy. We spent a bit of time talking about it today, and we\u2019re convinced that we have a unique position as an integrator because of our seeds, our unique position in seeds, and the emerging strength of our data science position. So in two short years, I think you\u2019ve seen Climate transition from theory to reality, and I think in the next two years that becomes even more important.","So as we look at the trough, as we look at the Bayer proposal and some of these other strategic alternatives, we are focused, my team and I, we\u2019re focused very, very clearly on creation of shareholder value, and that\u2019s where this begins and it\u2019s where it ends. So we\u2019re going to take a very rational approach to this, bearing in mind where the cycle is and the need for value creation, and we\u2019re going to really focus in the uniqueness of Monsanto and its part as a key integrator.","So I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but it\u2019s probably the scope of what I can discuss on our call.","David Begleiter","No, that\u2019s very helpful, Hugh. Just on the same subject, digital ag, can you discuss maybe further the challenge of getting paid for this platform at is very early, nascent stage of development from other parties?","Hugh Grant","Yes, so real briefly, our strategy isn\u2019t where it started, but in the early days of working with the Climate team in San Francisco, they were very adamant - and they were right - that this is about driving grower experience, and in the early days it\u2019s about delighting growers and sharing data insights with them. So as Brett talked about 95 million acres up on the platform, the first round of this for us, David, was gaining experience in the same way that all apps are developed, so gaining experience and letting growers work with this on their farms and their fields. The nitrogen advisor has been additional functionality and we have priced for that, and in the last two short years we\u2019ve got all of U.S. retail distribution upon the platform. We\u2019re either in discussion or concluded with all the machinery manufacturers, and I think the next natural step in this is to see some of our competitive companies and some alternate offerings up in that platform as well, so the grower experience--he doesn\u2019t need multiple iPads in the cab. ","I think as we move through this progression, then pricing to value and retaining a piece of that value in the same way that we\u2019ve done with traits becomes a natural next step. I think the experience of 15 years of trait development blends beautifully into the next handful of years on data science development and how we broadly license this platform with others. ","David Begleiter","Thank you very much, Hugh.","Hugh Grant","Thank you. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Chris Evans","Good morning, guys. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was hoping you--","Hugh Grant","Hey Bob, can you--you\u2019re breaking up. Can you get a little bit closer to the phone?","Chris Evans","I apologize. ","Hugh Grant","There you go, perfect.","Chris Evans","I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the eleventh hour sort of [indecipherable] glyphosate in Europe, so what\u2019s the long term expectation for use of glyphosate in that area? And then if you could also, sort of staying on that topic, talk a little bit about the pricing declines that seem to have outpaced your expectations - you know, what\u2019s the support for pricing?","Hugh Grant","Yes Bob, I\u2019ll--so thanks for the two elements. I\u2019ll maybe let Rob and Brett talk about this I\u2019d just say before he does, there\u2019s been an element of frustration in this with some of the bureaucracy in the EU, so it\u2019s beyond the eleventh hour but it\u2019s really good to see this finally come through. We\u2019d expected that it would, but it\u2019s nice to see the reality. I think it actually occurred during the call this morning, so Rob, maybe a few words on this.","Robert Fraley","Well, I think you captured it right. I mean, it\u2019s been a very painful process particularly when you consider that the EU has just completed the re-review of glyphosate and gave it a very strong safety record, and that review was largely led by the German regulators. They took four years, did incredibly detailed review and analysis, and concluded that the product is absolutely safe and has no indication of carcinogenicity. So what we\u2019ve seen play out, unfortunately, over the last six months has been the challenge of operating in the EU system between the parliamentarian votes and the Commission\u2019s final decision, and we--you know, effectively we watched the two teams play volleyball for six months. Today, it was great to see that the Commission moved forward on a science-based decision to extend the product. ","So we\u2019re--as Hugh said, the delay has been tough. We\u2019re delighted to have the approval and the extension and are moving forward, and we think that frankly this has been part of the logjam that has delayed our over-the-top Xtend approval. I think the real good news from today\u2019s announcement is I think it accelerates the timing on the approval for the over-the-top application of Xtend.","Hugh Grant","And then Brett, a word on Bob\u2019s question on pricing?","Brett Begemann","Yes, as we think about the pricing, Bob, it\u2019s always risky to try to call the bottom on any of these things, but I do believe that we\u2019ve kind of reached that bottom range of glyphosate pricing, and it\u2019s kind of bouncing around there the last few months. I really don\u2019t see anything in the near term that\u2019s going to shift that and move it in a different direction, so it\u2019s purely looking at where we were priced last year in the first half of the year versus where we\u2019re priced right now, and saying that that creates a bit of a headwind for us going into next year that we\u2019ll have to manage against.","I feel good about our position, though, and our cost position and how we\u2019re competing in that industry. We\u2019re down a little bit on volumes this year, but I think that we\u2019re going to recover those back next year as we see the momentum building across the marketplace. So we\u2019re in a good place, it\u2019s just going to be the challenging first half with the price differential between \u201916 and \u201917.","Chris Evans","Got it, thanks guys.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Perfect, thank you. Farmer credit\u2019s been a bit of an issue in Brazil, and it\u2019s also been an impediment in other emerging markets - Eastern Europe, India, and at least previously Argentina. When you look at your longer term outlook, how do you think about this in relation to your strategy, how could it affect your growth aspirations? Are there any things we should think about on how you plan on working with growers, distributors, co-ops, et cetera? Just any color on that would be appreciated.","Hugh Grant","Brett?","Brett Begemann","Yes, thanks for the question. I think as you go around the world, every farmer finds themselves in a different position, as do we. If you think about Argentina, for example, we use significant barter for our business down there, so a big chunk of our sales are through the barter system, which minimizes our credit risk with the Argentine farmer. They basically use the grain to buy their inputs.","In the case of Brazil, keep in mind with how currency has impacted our business negatively, it helps put the Brazilian farmer in a pretty good position right now. Buying in local currency and selling in U.S. dollars is not a bad place for them, so we feel reasonably okay. With all the disruption that\u2019s occurred in Brazil in the last year, I\u2019m actually optimistic about Brazil right now with the position of the farmer and their ability to access credit and buy products. Farming looks good, and we\u2019ve got Intacta and we\u2019ve got a strong corn business that\u2019s growing, and we\u2019ve priced up in that environment and it seems to be holding, so we look good in South America. ","When you get to Eastern Europe, it\u2019s a mixed deck over there. In the far east, there\u2019s some real challenges, call them geopolitical challenges with the Ukraine. We\u2019ve tended to manage our credit very aggressively - in other words, we don\u2019t extend a lot of credit, and we seem to be doing quite okay over there. That has impacted some of the pricing - some of the farmers have gone to lower priced seed which has impacted our global pricing, but overall we\u2019re in a good place and we continue to be conservative on how we manage the credit. ","Christopher Parkinson","Perfect. Just very quickly - on your efforts with channel in the U.S. over the last couple years, I imagine the number of seedsmen has grown fairly significantly, but can you just comment on this initiative quickly and the long term, both in terms of the go-to-market strategy, how that\u2019s working, as well as how growers are feeling about the brand\u2019s technology advancement over the last few years? Thank you.","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think the way we look at it is we like to sell seed the way farmers like to buy seed, and there is clearly farmers that want to buy seed through a direct relationship that we set up with channel. There is farmers that clearly want to buy through retail, which is predominantly our Dekalb Asgrow brands, is selling the seed the way farmers want to buy it. The channel brand has really done well in the last couple of years. We\u2019ve made some substantial improvements, moving it to an agency which created some confusion in our results for a couple of years as we made that transition, but it\u2019s going really well. I have to tell you, some of the other companies out there that are struggling with the performance of their products, the channel brand is a really interesting one for them to consider to become seedsmen for because they get access to the phenomenal pipeline of genetics and traits from Monsanto, and they get to handle a brand that they sell directly to farmers, which in many cases they\u2019ve been used to and that\u2019s the model they came out.","So we feel really good about the multi-brand strategy and how it\u2019s playing out.","Christopher Parkinson","Perfect, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Steve Byrne","Yes, thanks. Let\u2019s just continue down that path a little bit on the channel comment. Brett, you made a comment earlier about your corn genetic share improving this year. Within that, was there a mix shift, say, away from your premium brands, either to the channel brands or to your licensees, and what is the impact of any of that mix shift on price?","Brett Begemann","Yes, so it\u2019s really early to be that specific between the brands. I\u2019m very comfortable saying I believe that we grew our genetic footprint this year, and yes, there is some strength in some of the licensing business that participates in that. On the brand side, let me be really clear - the channel brand is not an inferior brand to Dekalb. The channel brand is positioned right along with Dekalb, and they both are superior brands targeting to the higher end of performance in the marketplace. There is always shifting between the premium brands in the marketplace - that occurs every year, but I\u2019m comfortable today saying that our direct brand share, we expect it to be flat this year. We\u2019re maintaining our position, so I think when we--when it all settles out in a few months, then we\u2019ll have the details around that, but I feel good with where we\u2019re at.","Hugh Grant","Steve, the only thing I\u2019d add is the good news is we have created genuine optionality, and you see--to Brett\u2019s point on growers buy and how where they want, they get the opportunity of the licensee route, they have the opportunity at channel or a national brand, and we\u2019ve seen nice migration from some of our competitors because of that. That\u2019s why that genetic footprint has stretched.","Steve Byrne","The source of your conviction about improvement in corn seed pricing next year, is that driven by mix shift, would you say, or more due to a price lift due to underlying commodity price gain?","Pierre Courduroux","So what we are expecting is actually to see a normalized market where the elements of the mix shift are going to be driving our portfolio, and as every year when we issue our price guards, we readjust our price guards based on the commodity price, based on the performance of the hybrid, but definitely--I mean, the key driver is going to be the mix lift that we are anticipating based on the introduction of our new hybrids.","Steve Byrne","Okay, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Hugh Grant","Good morning, John. Yes, we can hear you loud and clear.","John Roberts","I think the EU announced today that they\u2019ve opened an antitrust review of the Bayer combination. I think that\u2019s highly unusual if you don\u2019t actually have a deal yet. I think they normally have a first to file process, but I think they\u2019ve indicated that they would consider any additional deals, possibly holistically in combination with the prior two deals that have been filed. How do we think about the regulatory regime or the approval regime? Is this sort of a one-off environment, or can we rely on kind of past rules and how things have happened in the past? ","Hugh Grant","Yes, I think this must have happened while we were on the call, John. I think it\u2019s more the declaration of intent, rather than they have, so it\u2019s more the intent to do it than they will. My experience with these reviews over the last 15 years is they\u2019ve been pretty logical and pretty straightforward in Europe, but I did talk earlier, a previous question about value uncertainty from a share owner point of view and from a value creation point of view. That\u2019s obviously something that we would treat seriously in any discussions. ","So I can\u2019t really say more than that about it, but I think the European declaration was one of intent rather than starting.","John Roberts","Okay, and then given the uncertainty around Round Up in Europe that we\u2019ve had recently, do you think there was channel destocking? I assume it would have affected generics more than you, but I don\u2019t know if you were possibly affected by the supply channel just not wanting to hold as much Round Up inventory during this period of uncertainty.","Hugh Grant","No, we haven\u2019t seen that. I don\u2019t know what the generic impact has been, but we haven\u2019t seen it with our own brands. I mean, the certainty of today definitely helps, but the reality is weeds grow in the spring and you need to have the material there on hand to control them. So no, we haven\u2019t seen any shift in flow, John.","John Roberts","Okay, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the questions.","Laura Meyer","Christine, we\u2019ll take questions from one more and then we\u2019ll pass it to Hugh to close it.","Hugh Grant","Very good.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Hugh, I have a question about value creation at Monsanto. When you consider offers from other parties, and I know you\u2019re limited in what you can say, do you think about the value of the offer relative to where Monsanto might trade in three years or five years in this depressed agricultural environment, or do you have some--or do you and the board have some idea of the intrinsic value of the company that encompasses more favorable agricultural economic climates? How do you--yes, please.","Hugh Grant","Thank you. I\u2019m sorry I interrupted. Thank you for your question, and this will be the last question. As I indicated earlier, these are private conversations so it\u2019s difficult to comment substantively. But we\u2019re an agricultural business, we are developing technologies on a 10-year horizon. We\u2019ve been in existence for about 15 years, so you can\u2019t--you know, we\u2019ve done many of these calls together over the years. You can\u2019t look at the down cycle in an ag economy - farmers would never farm if they thought about the peaks and troughs, so you have to see through that when you\u2019re either buying a farm or if you\u2019re developing a technology.","So I guess the headline in this is if you\u2019re valuing a unique company like Monsanto, I would argue you can\u2019t look at one quarter. You can\u2019t look at a year - you need to take a 10 or a 20-year view, and that\u2019s how we develop technologies. When you look at the promise of Climate or you look at the value of the pipeline that Rob Fraley and his team have developed, I think you have to take that long view.","We\u2019ve been very clear since May that we were open to these discussions, but that the value had to be reflective of the company and the proposition that we have. The Bayer proposal was financially inadequate. We are looking at that proposal relative to other strategic alternatives, but you have to take the long view in this because the vagaries of the commodity markets are either punishing or they develop elation, but you have to kind of take a line through that. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve always built our resource models, that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always built these products on a seven and a 10-year development cycle, and that\u2019s how we will look at this. ","I guess I would finish by saying we are absolutely committed to optimizing share owner value, and we were look at the proposal in hand and we will evaluate these other strategic alternatives against that benchmark. That\u2019s what we need to do.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thank you so much. That\u2019s very clear.","Hugh Grant","Thank you for your question. With that, I want to thank you for your patience because we\u2019re a little bit tardy in our finish today. Let me just make two or three points, at the risk of repetition, and it kind of ties to Jeff\u2019s last point on the call.","2016 has been a challenging year for our industry. It\u2019s been a challenging year for the company, but our core businesses have done well but have suffered from some regulatory delays that we\u2019re beginning to see--literally on the call today, we\u2019re beginning to see turn. Despite this, innovation in this industry is needed and it\u2019s recognized by growers, and I think today we\u2019re uniquely placed as a key player in any integrated platform strategy, so regardless of how that integration strategy plays out, we have a central role in that. So as I mentioned on the last question, I\u2019m personally committed to the optimization of shareholder value.","So we\u2019re really pleased that you\u2019re joined us this morning. We are moving forward with preparation for Whistlestop, and we hope to see you there on August 17 and 18. If I was you, I\u2019d be booking a slot soon because those are hot tickets and they\u2019re selling fast. ","So with that, thanks very much for the call today and for your continued support. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star, zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, you may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team is Ben Kampelman.","Our second quarter call marks a critical time during our annual business cycle and importantly allows us to provide a meaningful outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at Monsanto.com.","We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website. ","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the company\u2019s actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today\u2019s press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","First, let me share our second quarter results as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $3.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $3.19 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year as-reported earnings per share of $2.41 and ongoing earnings per share of $2.42. ","With that brief overview, I\u2019ll hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge our progress against our two priorities for the year: number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to close the merger with Bayer. ","Let us start first with the deal, as shown on Slide 6. Bayer has led the regulatory filing process with support from Monsanto as appropriate, and as they indicated in their year-end earnings call, both parties are working towards closure at the end of this calendar year. They continue to expect the filing to be made with the EU Commission this calendar quarter, and progress has made with the second request from the U.S. Department of Justice. Like you, we also see the other proposed combinations advancing as this industry undergoes a necessary and a healthy transformation to serve farmers better around the world.","As the process moves forward, our emphasis at Monsanto is where it\u2019s always been: on bringing much needed innovation to growers. Rob and I have spent significant time sharing our perspectives with ag industry organizations, policy makers, and grower groups on the benefits of this deal. Innovation is at the heart of the industrial logic for combining with Bayer, just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry 20 years ago. Since then, we\u2019ve seen scores of biotech, breeding, and crop technology improvements and our view is that the next 20 years will raise the level of agronomic performance even further. Very simply, this deal is about accelerating innovation, optimizing integrated solutions, and expanding the offerings that will be available to farmers through broad licensing globally in the years to come. ","From delivering new choices even faster to expanding solutions in disease and insect control, our combination with Bayer is a real gateway to exciting possibilities in ag science, as shown on Slide 7. It doesn\u2019t stop there. We think greater focus can be brought to historically underfunded crops like wheat as well as opportunities in geographies where agriculture could benefit from improvements in scale, like parts of Asia and certainly in Africa. ","After outlining examples like these with growers, one thing is very clear: they want innovation and they fully recognize the role that it plays in bringing them solutions to run the profitable and sustainable operations necessary to meet the demand curves. This overarching need to produce more hasn\u2019t changed; in fact, as seen on Slide 8, demand continues to strengthen. The trend line from WASDE forecasts projects the annual demand for corn and beans is expected to rise. Growth expectations for just the 2016 - 2017 marketing year translates to demand for an incremental 1.7 billion bushels for corn and more than 600 million bushels for soybeans. To put that into context, if this incremental demand were met by new production acres in the U.S. alone, it would require more than 20 million new acres of corn and soybeans combined. ","As shown on Slide 9, it\u2019s Monsanto\u2019s proven innovation and unique platform advantages that position us well to meet these challenges and what makes us such an attractive complementary partner for Bayer. However, we\u2019re not sitting still and we continue to invest in our future. We\u2019re building upon our industry-leading Climate FieldView platform and strong foundation of seed, trait, and system solutions, particularly with our next generation technologies in insect and weed control. ","Shortly after we spoke back in January, we broke ground on our Luling, Louisiana glyphosate production site to make way for our first ever dicamba production facility, expected to come online at the end of this decade. This plant, together with capacity being added by the industry, will be an integral part of delivering the top weed control system throughout the Americas. We\u2019re stoking this demand with the fastest trait ramp-ups in our company\u2019s history, with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and Bollgard 2 Xtend Flex cotton. ","Longer term, we\u2019re building out our leading platforms with investment in R&D capabilities. We\u2019ve nearly completed the initial phase of our planned $400 million Chesterfield R&D site expansion and we expect that the ribbon cutting will be later this year. In addition, technical pipeline projects are progressing well, including our blockbuster Nemastrike technology with exceptional nematode control. The public comment period for the EPA approval process for this new technology recently closed with positive feedback, and we\u2019re now well on track for commercialization next year. Also, we reached another significant positive milestone in the re-registration of glyphosate in Europe, with the European Chemicals Agency concluding that glyphosate is not a carcinogen. Once again, this aligns with more than 800 studies spanning four decades that all confirm the safety of this critical farming tool. In fact, this same conclusion has been reached by the U.S. EPA, the European Food Safety Authority, and regulators in Japan and Canada and numerous other countries. So despite some headlines to the contrary, some science from respected organizations continues to prevail.","Finally on the business, we\u2019ve had an excellent first half, delivering $3.39 of ongoing earnings per share as compared to $2.25 in the prior year. Our gross profit improved nearly 20% in the first half due primarily to strong pricing and area expansion in corn in South America and the strong performance of our newest soybean seed and trait technologies. This growth in gross profit coupled with the absence of the Argentina currency devaluation and the gain on the Latitude sale has propelled this strong start to the fiscal year. Given these results and our increased confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year, our guidance for fiscal year \u201917 now moves to the high end of the range for both as-reported and ongoing EPS. ","So all in all, I\u2019m very proud of our team and their focus on our business. We\u2019re making strides towards closure on the pending combination, our record-breaking technology penetration continues to drive earnings growth, and we\u2019re investing for the longer term in R&D. We do all of this through our singular strategic lens to continue to bring value-added innovation to growers around the globe.","With that overview, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support this outlook. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thanks Hugh, and good morning everyone. Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let\u2019s begin the operational outlook with corn, as shown on Slide 10.","We continue to expect to grow our corn gross profit even as the commodity prices remain challenging in the mid to high $3 range. This is driven by global germplasm price mix lift in local currency and genetic share gains despite expectations that the global planted acres could now decline slightly.","Starting in the U.S., with an early spring our Q2 deliveries were ahead of expectations and provided some timing benefit. In addition, I\u2019m pleased to share that we\u2019re sold out of our first year DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids, which also came with our newest microbial seed treatment, Acceleron B-300 SAT. In Brazil, double digit price mix lift in local currency continues in the second quarter and we\u2019re seeing strong demand for VT Triple PRO traited hybrids. In Argentina, we now are estimating even greater growth in acres at more than 40%, and finally Europe remains on track with strong grower demand driving volumes in the second quarter, though we do expect some decline in acres planted compared to last year.","Let\u2019s move to our soybean franchise on Slide 11 next. We\u2019re very excited about the story developing here. We\u2019re on pace to deliver greater than 25% growth in global soybean gross profit and are seeing nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the United States is now moving fast, as shown on Slide 12. We have all the approvals in place for XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology for the key soybean growing states we\u2019re seeking, with the exception of Arkansas. We\u2019re also pleased to see that the recent EPA approvals of numerous tank mix partners, including glyphosate, providing industry-leading weed control and a convenient tool for growers. Seed supply is excellent and we now expect 18 million acres of traited varieties to be planted from Mississippi to Minnesota. This demand-driven increase from our prior estimates matches our largest trait launch ever and altogether at 18 million acres would be the highest penetration we\u2019ve ever achieved in the second year of a trait launch.","Moving to South America on Slide 13, performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 3 PRO continues to demonstrate its advantage over competing varieties, and we are in the early days of evaluating the first wave of our own yield trials. This adds to our confidence in the 45 million to 55 million acre range for the technology this year as Intacta continues to set trait penetration records. In Argentina, our planning assumption is there is a continuation of the current royalty capture system for the upcoming season.","Our other crops are also seeing steady growth, stating with cotton on Slide 14. Bollgard 2 XtendFlex cotton is now expected to exceed 4 million acres in the U.S., which will be a driver towards our target of delivering our third straight year of share gains. On top of that, we\u2019re starting to sell Bollgard 3 XtendFlex cotton in the U.S. this year to further increase the spectrum and durability of insect control. ","Moving to our climate business on Slide 15, we\u2019re seeing major advancements in a number of areas. Digital ag tools are rapidly evolving and the strategic differentiators for the Climate FieldView really set it apart. Collaborations and partnerships with others in the space, as well as our pace of adoption and expansion, have established our leadership role. Interest in joining our platform has been strong and we\u2019re currently in discussions with more than 25 potential technology providers. ","We remain on track to deliver our fiscal year target of 25 million paid acres, and geographically experience with the platform is growing in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil, as shown on Slide 16. In fact, in Brazil some of the largest growers in the country are using the technology on 750,000 acres. The feedback is good and we\u2019re off to a very promising start.","Lastly, let\u2019s close with ag productivity. We\u2019re seeing first half price improvements for generic glyphosate asset translate to retail, which we expect to result in modest price improvements in the second half of the year. This anticipated price increase plus volume growth places glyphosate on a more positive trend line, although we do anticipate some higher cost with the increased volumes. In addition, it was great to see the first shipments of XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology moving to retail, and we expect this to continue in the second half. ","In summary, I\u2019ll echo Hugh\u2019s comments - we delivered a great start to the year and our operational plans set us up for a strong close. We have tremendous momentum with the record penetration we\u2019re seeing with our latest soybean and cotton technologies and continue to anticipate genetic share gains across multiple crops and key geographies.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks Brett, and good morning to everyone. Let\u2019s start with a review of the second quarter. In Q2 we delivered as-reported earnings of $3.09 per share and an ongoing earnings of $3.19 per share. These translated to growth of more than 28% in both as-reported and ongoing earnings per share and was mostly driven by three things: more than $300 million of gross profit growth from our corn and soybean businesses, the absence of the approximate $180 million impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, and finally the $83 million gain from the sale of the Latitude business recorded in other income this quarter. ","In corn, gross profit grew by 12% in the second quarter and came mainly from Brazil, Europe and the U.S. U.S. corn growth related primarily to improved cost of goods with the return of a more normalized production plan, while Europe and the U.S. combined had a volume timing benefit of roughly $40 million stemming from strong grower demand. In addition, they both delivered anticipated share gains mitigated by expected planted acre declines. Finally, the single largest driver came from pricing in Brazil where we continued to see strong double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency. ","In soybeans, the 19% growth in gross profit and six points of margin expansion came from reduced COGS and increased trait revenues from our Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans in the U.S., which were compounded by higher volumes from expected increased soybean acres and share gains. Cotton gross profit also grew nicely in the quarter, where we saw more than $50 million in growth in the U.S. This was due largely to a timing benefit from a change in our customer contracts and to a lesser degree from initial sales of Bollgard 2 XtendFlex.","Moving to ag productivity, we saw our gross profit for the quarter grow by about 3% over the prior year. Regarding Roundup and our glyphosate based herbicides, we continued to experience the pricing headwinds we expected; however, at the segment level this was more than offset by incremental glyphosate volumes and the initial sales of our dicamba-based herbicides. Finally, as we expected, operating expenses increased in the quarter mostly due to the return to growth of the business. These increases were primarily driven by increased incentive accrual expense, higher commissions in South America, and greater investment in the Climate FieldView platform. They were partially offset by the continued savings from our restructuring and transformation actions. We continue to expect these to generate $200 million of operating expense and COGS savings versus the prior year on our path to $500 million of savings by 2018 versus our 2015 baseline, as shown on Slide 17.","For cash, for the first half of fiscal year \u201917 we delivered nearly a billion dollars of free cash flow as compared to $900 million in the prior year. This improvement was driven by the considerable increase in our net income, offset by working capital increases from receivables and inventories and payments for restructuring actions accrued in the prior year. These results reflect our new definition of free cash flow, which is operating cash flows less capex. This new definition of free cash flow aligns to the more commonly used definition by publicly traded companies, and we\u2019ve conformed our historical reporting and our guidance accordingly.","Let\u2019s move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 18. With strong first half results plus the outlook for the rest of the year, we now confidently expect to be at the high end of the as-reported earnings per share range of $3.95 to $4.44, and of the ongoing earnings per share range of $4.50 to $4.90. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect our seed and genomic segment gross profit to increase mid single digits as a percent year-over-year. In corn, we expect some volume gains from global genetic share gains particularly in the U.S. to contribute to this gross profit growth; however, we now anticipate acres planted to be down slightly on a global basis with the upside in South America being more than offset by the expected declines in the northern hemisphere. ","Global germplasm price mix lift in local currency is still expected to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages, with strong increases in South America being muted by germplasm price mix lift in the U.S. that is expected to be roughly flat. In soybeans, gross profit is expected to now grow by more than 25%, driven by new trait penetration and an anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. In cotton, with the strength of Bollgard 2 XtendFlex in the U.S. and the return of high-value acres in Australia, the gross profit is expected to grow by more than 35%. Meanwhile, other crop gross profit is expected to decline due to the absence of the one-time $210 million alfalfa technology license payment from Q3 of the prior year. ","Within ag productivity, considering yield dynamics and the variables Brett discussed, our gross profit guidance still remains within the range of $850 million to $950 million, albeit moving more towards the lower end. From a strategic deals perspective, with further advancement in our discussions, we are now expecting the benefit to be somewhat below the earlier estimate of $100 million from licensing and asset sales and now shared between the EBIT of our two segments in the second half of the fiscal year. This shift is in the projected recording of the ag productivity deal benefit to other income is the primary reason we are pointing to the lower end of the range for gross profit for that segment. ","Overall, operating expense in 2017, excluding the pending Bayer transaction costs and restructuring expenses, are still expected to increase slightly. This is because inflation and the costs associated with the return to growth of the business are anticipated to more than offset our savings. ","Finally, our outlook also assumes that changes in currency rates will have a relatively neutral effect on net income for the full year, and we continue to expect that tax rate for the year to be in the range of 25% to 28%. If we look just at Q3, we expect as-reported earnings per share to be roughly flat with the prior year. This is due to the absence of last year\u2019s Argentine related tax matters call-out of $0.50 per share mostly offset by the expected decline in ongoing earnings per share from the absence of the alfalfa deal, which was roughly $0.34 of earnings last year, and the volume timing shift from Q3 to Q2 in the European and U.S. corn businesses. ","For the full year, we now anticipate these earnings to translate to the high end of our range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows, resulting from expected operating cash flows at the high end of the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion and capex of $1.2 billion.","In closing, at the midpoint of our year, we look back on a strong first half driven by outstanding returns on innovation and financial discipline. As we look forward, we\u2019re increasingly confident in the outlook for our business and our continued progress towards closure of the pending combination with Bayer.","With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks Pierre. With that, we\u2019d now like to open the call for 20 minutes of questions. As we typically do, I\u2019ll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You\u2019re always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up. ","Christine, we\u2019re ready to take questions from the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just a question on the corn segment. It looks, as far as I can tell, that your cost performance came in a lot better than certainly what we expected and I think what the street expected, and just looking at the gross profit margin of almost 67% is the highest one we\u2019ve seen. So I get that there was a lot of pricing in the South American market, but it was cost that you called out in the press release, so did the cost come in better than expected and were these results and margins better than you expected?","Hugh Grant","Yes Vincent, thanks for your question. We\u2019re delighted with corn and soy performance, but Pierre, maybe just a little bit of color, and Brett, a few words on pricing?","Pierre Courduroux","I mean specifically, Vincent, regarding the point on corn gross margin, I think you pointed to the key elements of why we ended up in a really good place from a margin perspective. So pricing in South America, specifically pricing in Brazil, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, has been extremely strong and we\u2019ve seen a nice recovery and some growth in pricing in Brazil, so this has been something we\u2019ve been observing in the first quarter but also continuing into the safrinha market into the second quarter, so that was really very strong performance in Brazil. ","Regarding costs, you remember we\u2019ve always talked about having a penalty last year related to our cost of goods and reduced production plans. This year, we are going back to normal production plans, and as expected, we are seeing an improvement in our cost of goods position. So from a pure margin perspective, these would be the two critical drivers, and we\u2019ve also seen really nice performance in terms of volumes in the U.S., in Europe, part of that being related to timing - I mean, we got really nice mild weather during the winter, but also expected share gains and obviously we\u2019ll see that before the end of the year, but a very strong performance in corn this quarter, definitely.","Hugh Grant","That\u2019s good, I think you covered it. Thank you, Vincent.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Parkinson","Thank you. Just very quickly on Intacta, you\u2019ve mentioned you license out the germplasm providers to just over 90% share in LatAm, but can you just comment on the rough number of varieties you\u2019re on the context of the total portfolio versus last year and for the upcoming season? In other words, do you still need to ramp with certain licensees in terms of the number of varieties over the next two seasons to reach your long-term goals, or is this not really even a consideration anymore? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Chris, thanks for the question. I just got back from Sao Paulo at the weekend, and Brett it\u2019s my impression they\u2019ve colored in the map really, they\u2019re in good shape.","Brett Begemann","Yes, we\u2019re in a great position with Intacta in South America. We\u2019re well covered with varieties from the south to the north, and the seed companies will all continue to move Intacta into their latest and greatest varieties as they continue breeding, but that\u2019s just normal process. We have very good coverage with varieties now across the country.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect, thank you.","Hugh Grant","And yield\u2019s looking good?","Brett Begemann","Yield is just starting to come in, and we see our own stuff first before we do the rest, and we\u2019re positively inclined with what we\u2019re seeing with our own yield results. From the little bit that we\u2019re hearing from farmers and the little bit of harvest that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s positive there as well.","Hugh Grant","Yes.","Chris Parkinson","We\u2019ll see if we come in above 110 million.","Hugh Grant","We\u2019ll see. Thanks a lot, Chris. ","Chris Parkinson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Thank you. Hugh, a question on the impact of acreage shifts on your earnings. I know in the past that a shift from corn to soy was negative, but this year if we look at the top three crops - corn, soy, cotton - acreage is actually up 4 million in total. With the launch of Xtend, are you now indifferent between corn and soy acreage in the U.S., and then how do you see that going forward as you ramp Xtend up?","Hugh Grant","Yes Don, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll let Pierre do a little bit in the background, but this could be a unique year. We\u2019re still a ways from spring, but as Pierre said, we never really had much winter, it\u2019s a very open spring. It\u2019s turned a bit wet now, but it\u2019s a very open spring and we could be looking at a year where we get 90 million acres of corn and 90 million acres of soybeans. So the good news is we\u2019ve got that hedge between the two and the extraordinary news is we\u2019re launching Xtend this year, so if you think about Brett\u2019s numbers, 18 million acre launch in a 90 million acre market, we could be on 20% of the crop in the first year, which is extraordinary.","And then the economics, Pierre, just on the trade-off between the two 90s?","Pierre Courduroux","So Don, regarding the economics, they have slightly changed but the dynamics are still the same. We are still looking at a differential in between corn and soybeans in favor of corn for about two pennies, roughly, and regarding cotton and corn, they are now about equal. So the differences in between those different crops has reduced, which is actually more comfortable for us, but definitely corn is still the most profitable crop for us.","Don Carson","And then how do you see that Xtend ramp next year, Hugh, in years two and three?","Hugh Grant","It will be bigger. I mean, we are--you know, it\u2019s a catch-22. We spent so long waiting on this coming through, it has elements of the Intacta launch around it where, to Chris\u2019 previous question, we kept expanding the varieties. We kept ramping the opportunity, and as we look at next year, it\u2019s 50, 55 million in 2019, so it\u2019s going to be a significantly faster growth rate than we\u2019ve seen in a lot of things because of the rehearsal time that we had. So I would--if you\u2019re looking at your models, 55 in \u201919 is achievable.","Don Carson","Okay, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Hugh, you mentioned some genetic share gains in corn and beans this year. Just on corn in the U.S., how much share gain do you think you can achieve, and from whom are you realizing the share gains?","Hugh Grant","So early days, but Brett, you want to take a swing at the genetic gains?","Brett Begemann","You guys know me well because you hear from me every spring at this time that we know what the farmers\u2019 expectations are now from the WASDE report, and that\u2019s close to 90 million acres of corn. I will tell you that the biggest driver between now and June on what they actually plant is Mother Nature and the weather. You know, a month ago it looked like they were all going to start planting in the middle of March, and then it started raining and now there hasn\u2019t been much planted, so we\u2019ve got to see what actually gets planted, what the returns and replants look like. But what I will tell you is that I feel good enough with the deliveries that we\u2019ve already made, the remaining orders that we have and the expectation that acres will fall plus or minus a million around 90 million, that we\u2019re going to be in a strong position to grow share. ","When I look at where the share is going to come from, it\u2019s too early to call because I don\u2019t know what everybody else is doing, but I know where our volumes are and kind of where the acres are, so I feel really good about that. I think you\u2019re going to see it across the whole industry. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any earth-shattering moves that are occurring out there. That would be my anticipation. I think it will be across the board.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Koort","Thank you very much, good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Koort","I was hoping to explore a little bit the price mix challenges in corn, and wondering if you could speak to maybe how the new hybrids are doing or if that share of your portfolio has changed at all, and are we seeing just lesser price increases on the top end, greater price increases on the aging end? Can you give us some characterization of what\u2019s going on within your bands of hybrid years?","Hugh Grant","Yes, well the first piece, because we always tend to go at the U.S., but the extraordinary story in this quarter has been the Latin American contribution, particularly Brazil, particularly in corn and particularly in pricing in corn. But Brett, a little bit on how the curve looks in the U.S. relative to other books, and how that\u2019s evolved?","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think as all of you know, the environment for our customers continues to be very difficult with corn prices still--call it plus-minus 350, hanging in there somewhere. That\u2019s not a robust pricing scenario for our farmer customers, so it creates a challenging environment.","So two things that that impacts: number one, as you increase yield, which we do with our new hybrids and introduced those into the marketplace, the value of that incremental yield is based upon the price of the commodity, so that has an effect, Bob, on how much you actually go up based on that yield gain that\u2019s occurring. Then, it also plays into the farmers\u2019 expectation around how they set their portfolio.","Here\u2019s what has not changed, and this has been consistent for many, many years. Farmers do not back away from buying the latest and greatest, because they drive yield and productivity. That is their only friend. Whether it\u2019s a good commodity environment or a bad commodity environment, that\u2019s their only friend, is drive yield and dilute the fixed costs that they're getting across their business. When they start using tools like Climate and start managing their other inputs more effectively and efficiently, and they can still get those yield increases, they can drive their cost per unit of production down. ","So that\u2019s the focus, and that\u2019s why you look at this year, we\u2019ve completely sold out of our Disease Shield hybrid with the new B-300 SAT which is--that is our top of the line, it doesn\u2019t get any better than that, and those sold out. So farmer demand for high end is still there. They look at adjusting through the rest of the portfolio, and it\u2019s been hard to get those price increases with commodity price. That\u2019s how it plays out and puts us where we\u2019re at.","Robert Koort","Great, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.","Joel Jackson","Hi, I just want to get a sense of how competitive the market\u2019s been for corn in the U.S. this spring. We had heard that it\u2019s gotten more competitive, a little more discounts in the last few months. Maybe you could compare it to how the season played out about a year ago. Thanks.","Hugh Grant","Yes, a different season than last year. To Brett\u2019s point on when you see commodity prices where they are, it\u2019s tough. Growers are in a tough environment, so competition if alive and well, but more hotspots that national. Brett? ","Brett Begemann","Yes, we went into the year with our eyes wide open, but I would tell you it\u2019s been, as much as I can frame it, a normal year. There\u2019s always pockets - that happens every year, and when you have a smaller acre base, everybody is fighting hard for their position. There is a lot of good products out there competing and there\u2019s new products being introduced, so you\u2019re going to see some, but I\u2019d call it as close to normal as you could frame it. That\u2019s kind of what we were hoping for and expecting, and that\u2019s kind of where it\u2019s landed.","Joel Jackson","Where were the hottest pockets?","Brett Begemann","I\u2019m sorry?","Joel Jackson","Where were the hottest pockets of competition?","Brett Begemann","It\u2019s not even where you could frame it by state, because it really is within pockets within states, where there is, you know, our portfolio versus everybody else\u2019s portfolio and what your mix looks like in a given multi-county area and that type of thing. So you find places where you have extra strength, if you will, or weakness, and everybody in the industry is very good at understanding where other companies have strengths and weaknesses, and you go after those opportunities. That creates a little bit of the paint rubbing that occurs in some of those pockets, but they\u2019re not even big enough to call them states.","Joel Jackson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much, good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Your corn revenues were up 8%. Can you give us a rough idea of how much of that was volume price and currency? And in your ag productivity area, you sound more optimistic about glyphosate pricing, but you\u2019re now on the lower end of your gross profit expectations. Is that because there\u2019s licensing revenue that\u2019s missing that you expected, or has there been a reallocation to the other income area so that really you would be at the higher end of your expectation if there were no reallocation?","Hugh Grant","Right, two good questions. ","Pierre Courduroux","So if you look at the first half and in corn, what we\u2019ve seen is--I mean, I would qualify the growth really into three buckets. The first one would be the volume performance in South America and the price performance in South America, mainly in Brazil, and this would represent about half of the growth. Then, if you look at the northern hemisphere, you look into the U.S., you look into northern Europe, the rest of the growth is coming from those places and it\u2019s going to be mostly volume and COGS, and roughly 50-50 in between volume and COGS. So at a really high level, that\u2019s how I would qualify the growth you\u2019re seeing in our first half corn results.","Jeff Zekauskas","And in ag productivity?","Pierre Courduroux","So regarding ag productivity in the second part of the year, I think you\u2019ve pointed to a couple of the elements that are driving our thinking. So first of all, we are really happy to see the price of Roundup continuing to slowly go up, which is favorable and which was one of our planning assumptions getting into the year, so this one will be a positive in the second half. What we are seeing in the second half is--I mean, because of the sale of the Latitude business, we are not going to have the revenues from that business that we usually enjoy in the fourth quarter, and then from a cost of goods perspective we\u2019ve got a couple of increases in cost of goods in our glyphosate business and also a number of projects costs on the manufacturing side that are going to impact our second half results. So these are the key drivers of our guidance into the second half of the year. ","Regarding the slight adjustment to our guidance in the second half, it\u2019s mostly that some of the deals we are contemplating based on the world we\u2019ve been doing is also going to be recorded in other income rather than gross profit. But overall, I mean, the nice thing we are seeing in this segment is that our glyphosate business now is on the right trend.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you.","Laura Meyer","Christine, we\u2019ll take questions from one more. Sorry, I cut you off there, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","No, it\u2019s all right. Thank you so much.","Hugh Grant","Thanks Jeff. So one more question, Laura?","Laura Meyer","Yes, we\u2019ll do one more.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Frank Mitsch","Yes, thank you so much, Laura. I appreciate that. I had a question on the expected closing for the transaction. Hugh, obviously you\u2019ve seen extended delays in other M&A, and you\u2019re still holding to the end of the 2017 target. How confident are you, or what gives you the confidence there? I guess you also have a really good idea between you and Bayer as to where the issues would be. I\u2019m curious if there have been exploratory talks with other companies on the expected regulatory remedies that may be required.","Hugh Grant","Yes Frank, thanks for the questions. You know, from the beginning of this, our position has been that all these deals should be done and that the industry really not only would benefit, but the industry really needed this consolidation. So as you think about despite the terrible commodity prices at the moment, the grower, to Brett\u2019s point, is desperately hungry for innovation, and a big piece of that innovation, I think, is going to come through this work.","Each of these deals is unique, but we are heartened to see the deals ahead of us making progress, because I think it underscores the fact that the regulatory process works. Then to your point on closure by year end and confidence, we\u2019ve learned over the years that it\u2019s never good to speculate on government agencies, but I would tell you the unique thing about our deal--I guess everybody thinks that their deal is unique, but the unique thing about this deal is the very limited amount of overlap. So as this call this morning has underscored, we\u2019re really strong in the area of seeds and biotech, Bayer is the premier company in the broad front of crop protection, and I think that--you know, I won\u2019t speak of regulatory agencies, but the remedy lies in the elimination of that overlap around the world.","So we are working--Bayer has taken the lead, we are supporting them, but we are working diligently towards a year-end close, and Rob and I have been [indiscernible] plane hours going and talking to ag constituencies around the world, and those have gone well. The feedback there has been good because there is such a focus on the need for not just more innovation, but faster innovation. The timelines, when you think about how long we waited on Xtend - you know, seven years from submission to approval, there\u2019s a need to kick start faster innovation in this industry, and I\u2019m hopeful that this conclusion, the conclusion to this deal will see a phase shift on timing as well.","So that\u2019s how I\u2019m looking at it, and obviously as owners and people interested in the company, we will keep you up to speed as we get more to talk about.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much for the question.","So let me respect your time. I thank you for joining us today, and thanks to Laura and her team for continuing to bring, albeit streamlined communication, but keeping the facts in front of you during this period. ","So as we close out today, I\u2019d say it\u2019s clear that the year ahead for us will be significant, and we here at Monsanto are clearly focused on our two key deliverables. To that end, our plan to return to EPS growth in \u201917 is tracking nicely, and to the previous comments from Frank, we continue to work towards closing the agreement to combine with Bayer by the end of this calendar year.","I\u2019m very proud of our teams here at Monsanto. They have maintained their focus on the business, and as always they\u2019ve maintained a focus on our grower customers during a tough time and have turned in really good results.","So thanks again to you for joining us on the call this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again in June on our Q3 earnings. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Christine and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Boeker, Priyal Patel and Ashley Wissmann.","Our third quarter call provides the wrap up of our two most significant quarters and the early views into our outlook for the coming year. Today we will be sharing a business and strategic overview as well as a summary of our third quarter results and full-year outlook. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.","We have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the company\u2019s actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-Q and in today\u2019s press release.","First and foremost, let me review our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4. Our third quarter ongoing earnings per share is $2.39, well above the range we outlined at our second quarter call due primarily to the successful completion of the licensing agreement with Scotts Miracle Gro, reinforcing our confidence for the year.","Our free cash flow year-to-date is the use of $789 million as compared to a use of $1.4 billion year-to-date in the prior year, primarily reflecting the absence of the Climate acquisition and the Novozymes transaction in the current fiscal year. With these results and our outlook for the year, we remain at the low end of the guidance ranges namely $5.75 to $6 of ongoing earnings per share, and $2 billion to $2.2 billion of free cash flow as shown on Slide 5.","With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Laura and good morning to everybody on the line. The close of our third quarter is always a pivotal time in our business and never more so than this year. With our proposal to combine with Syngenta, we have put forward the transformational plan to further drive sustainable intensification for growers in the future.","Our business and our pipeline are stronger than they have ever been. Our ethos, however, is to continually challenge ourselves to be proactive and authentic. With our proposal we are looking beyond short term macro challenges to drive the next evolution in agriculture.","The challenges facing the world's food supply continue to evolve. The growing population along with our volatile and changing climate place ever increasing burdens on global food production as shown on Slide 6. Equipping farmers with the right set of innovations that will help solve tomorrow's food challenges today requires more than a new company and requires a new vision and a new approach.","This is what is at the heart of this new company proposal as shown on Slide 7. Combining the strengths of Monsanto and Syngenta would accelerate the development of new innovations, increase our scale and reach and provide a broader spectrum of products for growers around the world and it would use data science to offer a more insightful, precise approach to agriculture.","Syngenta's announcement yesterday, albeit one sided communication is promising and it does reinforce the validity of our integrated solutions theory, but in our opinion overstates the risks to execute the proposal, and without Monsanto as a partner, it lacks our leading seed footprint, digital Ag platform and track record for innovation and execution.","Monsanto-Syngenta combination represents the optimal solutions to unlock this value. We believe we are simply the best positioned to drive the opportunity with a current proposal that offers a significant premium, more than 30% over the three-year average price, 43% premium price versus the unaffected stock price, and a 45% premium over the 12 months weighted average stock price. And importantly, it provides an ongoing growth opportunity for the combined shareowners.","So I would continue then to encourage the shareowners to appeal to the Board to simply engage in constructive discussions with us regarding a very attractive proposal, one that we believe has the best interest of our customers, our respective shareowners and society in mind.","So let's take a closer look at the core tenets of our strategic rationale that support this assertion as shown on Slide 8. As always begins with innovation. By using the R&D capabilities of Monsanto and Syngenta and the fields of breeding biotechnology, crop protection, biological and data science it will allow us to put now solutions in the hands of farmers. Secondly, a stronger global presence with more integrated solutions unlocks scale and reach that isn\u2019t possible today, more acres, more farms, more crops and more geographies.","The new company will bring a new set of options to farmers in several regions of the world who due to limitations in their access to technology are not currently able to maximize production. Today, our foundation and our core crops reaches 400 million of the world's 3.5 billion acres of arable land. To fully address the demands for food production we need to deliver technology and insights to every acre and every farmer, from large scale operations in the Americas to small holder farmers in Africa. All farmers deserve the choices and the opportunities to be successful.","This combination would expand our ability to deliver innovation across more of those acres including the highly relevant cereal crops which make up the majority of the global caloric intake.","Third, this would give us an even more precise approach to every acre creating immediate and long-term revenue growth opportunities through a diverse range of optimized, integrated solutions. Near term by combining Syngenta's leading crop protection portfolio with Monsanto's leading seeds footprint we would have the unique ability to provide leading science based recommendations of integrated seeds, traits, and crop protection solutions. This integrated approach is no longer a theory, but the reality that we see today with the success of our Roundup Ready PLUS and our Acceleron seed care programs.","This combination would also allow us to more fully participate in the value creation from our crop protection solution recommendations. A prime example of that is our announcement today to begin our preliminary investment in dicamba production at our Luling, Louisiana location. Pending final approvals we are considering a potential investment of more than $1 billion over the course of three to five years to support this 200 million acre opportunity.","Longer term and unique to Monsanto, we will be able to unlock a new data driven approach to provide farmers even more valuable real time insights about their crops with our Climate platform. The information will provide actionable crop protection recommendations to farmers to maximize productivity, while ensuring inputs are applied in a precise manner to meet society's broad goal to preserve and protect our environment.","And this is ultimately what makes this proposal unique. Many in the industry have theorized on integrated strategies, but we believe we are best positioned with our strong seed footprint and our leading digital Ag platform. This bottom line delivers new opportunities and much needed yield for growers around the world.","Fourth, it provides synergies that create value for shareowners. We believe the proposed combination would deliver substantial cost synergies and revenue growth opportunities that create value for shareowners of both companies. This includes an attractive return on invested capital and a responsible capital structure taking into our current cash proceeds from the planned divestitures.","These core tenets are not new to us. Our track record and our commitment to innovation paired with our execution and our financial discipline positions us well to lead the next evolution in agriculture. The many milestones we have reached this year as Brett and Pierre will highlight offer the continued proof points and give us confidence to reconfirm our full year guidance.","Looking to the longer-term as shown on Slide 9, optimized spending and the milestones that we delivered this year reinforce our confidence in our five-year plan to more than double our fiscal year 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019. While we believe the combination with Syngenta as optimal to several customers for the long-term and would drive even greater growth in long-term earnings per share, our current portfolio and our pipeline leads the industry and provides multiple levers to drive our long-term growth projections.","We are committed to using the full range of variables in this plan adopting the past to our long-term target as conditions shift. While the pursuit of this next evolution in agriculture creates new opportunities to meet the long-term demands of sustainable food production, importantly we're not allowing it to distract us from managing the business at hand.","So where are we today? We've made a highly compelling proposal to Syngenta at 449 Swiss francs per share, one that provides 43% or 12 billion Swiss franc premium to the shareowners along with the potential for significant upside from the benefit [ph] of the growth prospects of the combined entity as the two companies together are more valuable than the two alone.","Furthermore we have provided significant regulatory certainty by agreeing to divest all of Syngenta's seeds and traits businesses along with competing chemistry products. We've underscored our confidence in obtaining regulatory approvals by offering a substantial $2 billion reverse breakup fee if we're unable to obtain such approvals. The interest in the sale of the seed assets has been extraordinary given us confidence that we can divest of the businesses and attract this price.","I am personally encouraged by their actions that helped our proposal from our respective shareowners, customers and our stakeholders. It is disappointing that Syngenta has not engaged in substantive discussions about the many benefits of the combination including those for farmers around the world.","We remain committed to unlocking this opportunity and we will continue to pursue a constructive conversation. But the window for seizing this opportunity is measured in months not years. This vision is simply too important to delay executing to make a reality for growers and owners alike.","So with that, I'll handover to Brett to provide the operational business update. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thank you and good morning to everyone on the line. There is no doubt it has been a tough year with the macro pressures facing global agriculture, namely our retreat and corn acres, currency and pressured commodity prices. That said, I've not seen our relationships with our farmer customers, our portfolio, our position in the market or our pipeline stronger than I see them right now. I feel really good about our position and that's a real testament to the strength of our core business.","You need to look no further than this year and our third quarter performance top see this strength and the benefits of the global portfolio we've cultivated. A real highlight this quarter stems from a core element of our strategy, our broad licensing approach. In the second quarter we highlighted that there were licensing opportunities that could come as soon as this year and in our third quarter we announced an agreement with Scotts Miracle Gro unlocking additional value in the Roundup Lawn & Garden brand.","As we look across our pipeline of new products, as well as our existing portfolio and brand franchises, we expect to continue to attract additional licensing opportunities. In corn on Slide 10, we continue to see demand for the newer hybrids and technologies enabling positive germplasm mix lift and footprint expansion. The portfolio mix curve is intact and demonstrates that even in this environment growers are demanding the newest hybrids.","Exclusive of currency headwinds we continue to expect to deliver positive germplasm mix lift for the full year and we continue to see footprint expansion as we remain on track to hold or grow our branded share in every major market in the face of declining corn acres which we still estimate to be down 11 million to 12 million acres over the past two years.","With the line of sight from our third quarter, where we've seen a good uptick in the U.S. end season ordering, we now believe corn acres will be in the of 88 million to 89 million acres. We are also seeing the shift in the channel brand we were expecting as the growth in that business is now largely reflected in our third quarter results. Against that, we now expect a softer start in Latin America due to industry expectations that acres will be lower in the coming season and also slightly lower acres in other ex-U.S. regions such as Europe.","As I look at this 2015 season, the germplasm price mix lift and footprint expansion we're tracking towards in a time of compressed margins for growers reflects the continued demand for high-performing seed technologies based on strong product performance and customer relationships, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term outlook for this business.","In soybeans the early milestones in the decade of the bean translate to margins with our soybean platform set to deliver over half $0.5 billion in gross profit growth since the end of the fiscal year 2013. This growth highlights the significance of the runway of opportunity in this platform.","Intacta, the single largest incremental driver of our soybean growth on Slide 11 is delivering. We've reached a record 15 million acres across South America this year and with production and operational plans in place for fiscal year 2016 we expect to penetrate an estimated 30 million acres with greater than 150 varieties in Brazil alone, meaningful tipping point in the 100 million acre opportunity for Intacta.","In addition to rolling out production plans, we continue to make meaningful progress with the establishment of the POD system in Northern Argentina. Approximately 70% of growers elected the pay upfront and we've now seen the majority of the grain handling partners operationalized this system collecting royalties for those who opt to pay at harvest.","In the U.S. it's too soon to tell exactly where acres will shake out, but with the additional clarity we have from the spring planting progress, we expect U.S. soybean acres closer to 85 million versus earlier estimates of 87 million acres and the combination of shipments in our order book continues to indicate our share is growing with farmers continuing to choose Roundup Ready 2 Yield as the product of choice across our branded and licensed footprint.","Our Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System as shown on Slide 12 comes on the heels of Intacta. We continue to make progress on pre-commercial activities in the U.S. setting up what we expect to be a record soybean launch targeting more than 3 million acres in 2016 pending necessary regulatory approvals.","To that point, this quarter we reached an important milestone with the receipt of the EU import approval for Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans and we\u2019ve submitted all the required data to the China Ministry of Agriculture and await their approval. Farmers are in the need of this technology and we\u2019re looking forward to being able to deliver this to the market in 2016 setting up the next wave of growth in our soybean business.","We can see the demand for this next generation weed control technology and cotton this year on Slide 13. Despite the pullback in cotton acres this year, our limited introduction of Bollgard II XtendFlex is sold out with the technology exceeding our initial target reaching more than 750,000 acres as growers limited returns to ensure they could access these new varieties on as many acres as possible.","We expect these new best-in-class varieties to drive back-to-back share growth in the Deltapine brand in the U.S. as we remain on track for Deltapine to become the number one brand share position.","We\u2019re also seeing better than expected progress in the rollout of our Climate Pro offering this season. At the beginning of the year, we laid out three key priorities for the platform and we see significant progress against those shown on Slide 14 as well as continued evolution of the platform in this emerging technology space to set up the focus on an integrated platform.","First, we committed to stepping up our investment and we\u2019ve expanded our organization to enhance our offerings and expertise, we've closed on our 640 Labs acquisition in December and our organization is already incorporating their capabilities, second we targeted to increase our active enrollment in the Climate platform.","To date, we\u2019ve enrolled more than 75 million acres on the Climate Platform, which is roughly 45% of the total planted corn and soybean acres in the U.S. and with the current usage trends from those who use the platform weekly, we are tracking nicely towards our active used target of 45 million acres.","And finally, I\u2019m most excited about the runway to our premium offerings with the significant step up in orders this past month, our premium services now exceeds 5 million acres; that is 2.5 times, our initial target. While not financially material in this early stage of adoption, it is clear proof that farmers value improved insights to allow them to reduce known variability and improve overall productivity.","Overall, this performance increases our confidence that Climate will serve as the integrator in our vision of fully integrated solutions. I\u2019m also pleased to highlight that our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes is off to a great start. Since the close of the deal in February of 2014, our partnership is stronger than ever. Integration of the existing business is occurring smoothly and joint product and R&D teams are established and running well. In fact, roughly 2000 microbial streams which is an increase of four times the prior season's quantity have been sourced from our joint discovery efforts fermented by Novozymes and quoted on corn and soybean seeds by Monsanto.","These have now been planted across more than 50 sites in the U.S. In addition, our teams are running microbial field tests in over 20 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia in our effort to discover new transformational microbial solutions for farmers.","In Ag productivity, our third quarter was a significant one, not only because of the Scotts agreement, but also because we\u2019re seeing the volume shift to our branded business we expected as we provide customers with more of our branded products for their critical over-the-top applications. This puts us on track for a significant step-up in the portion of our business that\u2019s sold as a branded volume this year.","Against that, we\u2019re seeing some incremental softening in price at the retail level. So consistent with our strategy, we continue to adjust our pricing to maintain a premium over the generics within our targeted ranges.","Further across the industry in the U.S. with the early and quick planting window in some regions, coupled with the extended periods of rain in other areas, we\u2019ve seen some decline in volumes for Q3. As of today, growers patiently wait to make the critical over-the-top space in the fourth quarter.","As I step back and look at this year, it\u2019s evident that the power of a balanced portfolio, coupled with differentiated brands and technologies drives growth. This is allowing us to better withstand a challenging Ag backdrop and backs our confidence in our growth longer term.","We fully expect the macro environment to recover and are well positioned to participate when it does. That said, as we develop our operational plans for next year, we are taking a clear eyed view and we expect that many of these headwinds will continue into fiscal year 2016.","As we proactively plan for the success of our long-term growth vision in light of these trends, we plan to continue to optimize our operating cost structure. As we target the next level of savings, we plan to optimize processes, streamline administrative cost and use automation and data science to optimize the way we do work in the lab and in the field in products we deliver and in ways we deliver the experience. This is about using technology and smarter processes to maintain our operational effectiveness, while continuing to invest for the long-term success of our new growth platforms.","I\u2019d like to close my operational update with our announcement to begin our preliminary investment in a dicamba manufacturing facility. We are setting the stage for the industry\u2019s next leading integrated solution in weed control shown on Slide 15.","The Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System has a practical fit of more than 200 million acres when looking across soybeans and cotton in the Americas and has the potential to be even bigger if ultimately expanded to include corn.","Today\u2019s dicamba production capacity covers less than 20% of the expected opportunity. Bottom line, with today\u2019s announcement we\u2019re taking the initial step to ensure that growers have access to all elements of the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System. Over the next decade, as the technology penetrates more of the 200 million plus acre opportunity, this holds the potential to further diversify our Ag productivity segment and provide a source of growth longer term.","This is the prime example of the integrated solutions we\u2019ve been sharing in our vision for a new combined Ag company and demonstrates how we can more fully participate in the value we create and deliver an expected attractive return on capital with the proposed investment.","In summary, our business accomplishments this year in a more challenging Ag environment are remarkable. They highlight the strength of a strong portfolio and the importance of disciplined business plans.","Importantly, as I look at this year, we\u2019ve delivered on many key milestones that we expect to propel our growth longer term. These milestones along with licensing opportunities, disciplined spend and a solid capital allocation strategy backs our confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term target to more than double our 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019.","As Hugh indicated, the pursuit of this next evolution in agriculture is of utmost importance to us to meet the long-term demands of sustainable food production. And I look forward to engaging in constructive discussions with Syngenta to begin that journey, fully recognizing that the strong healthy base business we have in Monsanto today is vital to the success of the new company.","With that, I will pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks Brett and good morning to everyone. With the close of our third quarter, we have essentially met our full year earnings per share guidance for the fiscal year with the delivery of $5.75 of ongoing earnings per share on a year-to-date basis.","This was accomplished through a combination of leading innovation of balanced portfolio and financial discipline in terms of how we manage our spend, in how we capture the value from our portfolio and in how we advance our capital structure.","So let\u2019s look at the highlights. In soybeans we see continued strong performance of our Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S. starting off to tremendous growth from Intacta in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, we delivered more than $200 million of gross profit growth in global soybeans and improved our gross profit margins by four points.","In our global corn business, germplasm mix lift remained positive when excluding the effects of currency, and our year-to-date gross profit margins were essentially flat at 63% versus the prior year with a five points improvement in the third quarter. Our margins benefited from the change in our business model in the U.S. channel brand and from global germplasm mix lift, which now offset the decline in trait pricing in Brazil and the increases in corn COGS primarily in Brazil and Europe.","On an absolute basis, the total corn gross profit declined by about $300 million as the benefit from germplasm price mix lift and the growth in our global branded and license share was more than offset by the decreasing global acres, weaker foreign currencies and increased cost of goods.","In cotton, well the absolute gross profit is down primarily from the declining acres in the U.S. and Australia. Gross profit margins improved by four points driven by the adoption of new higher value cotton varieties in the U.S. and increases in our licensed business in India.","With the one-time benefit of $274 million related to the sell of an intellectual property perpetual license to Scotts and an increase in the branded mix of glyphosate herbicides, our year-to-date Ag productivity gross profit shows an increase of about 2%. However, the decline in generic glyphosate pricing has continued and we also saw some delays in glyphosate volumes in Q3.","Further, our teams have remained extremely disciplined on the spend front through effective management of variable spend and open positions. Year-to-date our total operating expenses were flat with the prior year effectively absorbing more than $100 million of inflationary increases and a ramp in spend on our new Climate and biological platforms. This discipline has allowed us to lift our year-to-date EBIT margin by nearly one point.","Finally, we successfully completed our 6 billion accelerated share buyback program this quarter and our share count now stands at 469 million shares outstanding, a reduction of more than 55 million shares since we initiated our new capital allocation strategy just a year ago.","With this strong year-to-date performance and the light of sight we have on our fourth quarter, we reconfirm our full-year guidance for ongoing earnings per share at the low end of our original range of $5.75 to $6 as shown on Slide 16.","Practically this means that our fourth quarter is now expected to be close to breakeven as the benefit from licensing transaction we had expected in Q4 in seeds and genomics came to fruition instead in Q3 in Ag productivity with the signing of this agreement with Scotts.","The amount of this benefit exceeded our placeholder estimate of about $100 million into the fourth quarter and the increase is helping offset some additional market softness in corn Roundup and soybeans for the full year. At this juncture, we do not expect any additional material licensing agreements before the end of the fiscal year.","Looking at our full year guidance, we now anticipate that our gross profit for seeds and genomics will be essentially flat year-over-year, but with roughly a half point in gross profit margin improvement. The evolution since our Q2 call is two-fold. First, our global corn gross profit is now expected to be down more than $200 million for the full year as we are not expecting Latin America to have as strong a start as originally anticipated and because planted acres across Europe ended lower than we had expected while their COGS increased.","Second, our global soybean business gross profit, while still expected to grow by more than $200 million for the full year is down slightly from prior estimates as it now appears that U.S. acres will be modestly lower than expected.","For Ag productivity, we now expect the gross profit to be down only slightly for the full year reflecting the benefit of the Scotts transaction as an offset to the anticipated 15% to 17% decline in gross profit related to the softening of generic glyphosate pricing and currency headwinds this fiscal year.","From a spend perspective, we still expect our total operating expenses inclusive of the new platform investment to be down in the range of 3% to 5% likely closer to the higher end of the range. We continue to manage variable and discretionary spend very closely, which is typically higher in our fourth quarter with currency and lower incentive also driving lower expenses.","Our expense is expected to be a little less than half of the prior year amounts and our net financing expense in Q4 is expected to increase over the Q3 run rate with our typical incremental customer financing programs.","Finally, the tax rate for the full year continues to migrate lower and we now expect it to be in the range of 27% to 28% more in line with our third quarter effective tax rate.","From a free cash perspective, we continue to track to the lower end of our original guidance of $2 billion to $2.2 billion as shown on Slide 17.","Our net income and working capital use remain consistent with our prior guidance and we have begun the execution of our plans to proactively manage our corn inventory for next year for the planning of a smallest seed production plant this spring. This plant reduces long-term inventory risk and is an effective management of our cash. So depending on the ultimate yield it may translate into a 1 to 2 point margin bounce in corn next year due to lower fixed cost of fixed cost absorption.","While planning for the next steps in building our Xtend platform with the potential meaningful capital investments of our Luling plant for the production of dicamba we remain very diligent in the management of our investing cash flows. We expect the investment to exceed $1 billion over three to five years with the preliminary investment beginning now.","With our excellent conversion of earnings into cash, we continue to target the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 as a standalone company. However, as of now we have put our share repurchase program on hold as we continue to pursue our Syngenta proposal.","The successful combination with Syngenta at our proposed price and consideration mix would translate into a higher leverage ratio for this near term. But to be clear, a solid investment grade credit rating and continued access to the commercial paper market going forward is an important consideration for us. We expect substantial cash proceeds from the proposed divestitures and before finalizing the permanent financing of any potential Syngenta transaction, we intend to consult with the rating agency.","Looking beyond the current year as Brett mentioned, we are in the process of assembling our operation plan for fiscal year 2016 and bearing a significant shift in the U.S. growing season or the general macroeconomic environment we are planning for the continuation of several headwinds from this year.","As we build the plan, we will prudently consider currency, commodity prices, corn COGS and generic glyphosate prices. This of course is expected to be balanced against key growth drivers including the Annual Corn Germplasm Refresh, Intacta expansion, Xtend launches, continued licensing opportunities and expected share growth in our seed footprint globally.","Finally, the plans we\u2019re developing also consider the opportunity to potentially reduce and optimize our operating expenses in the range of $300 million to $500 million over the course of the next two fiscal years. We are building options in these plants to allow us to adjust the level of savings with improved clarity on the potential cost synergies from the proposed combination with Syngenta.","The associated cost to implement these plans, timing of approvals and execution will ultimately be contingent upon the outcome of our proposal to Syngenta. In the coming months and as we get better clarity on the evolution of these macro factors and the critical now remaining ph growing season we will provide more specifics on the outlook for fiscal year 2016.","Our five-year plan is a natural expansion of the coming year\u2019s operational plan and we remain confident in our commitment to more than double our 2014 ongoing EPS by 2019 as shown on Slide 18.","Our foundation and opportunity for gross profit growth remains strong and the continuation of financial discipline, both in terms of estimated cost savings and capital structure, backs our confidence in the long-term outlook.","Continued share repurchases, accretive acquisitions and capital investments all have the potential to contribute to these commitments in addition to the power of innovation, the increasingly balanced portfolio and the financial discipline that have led us to our success to date. The delivery of key business milestone coupled with our financial discipline fuels our long-term growth and provides the springboard for the vision Hugh outlined.","A proposal to combine with Syngenta to create a new even more innovative solution oriented global Ag company represents the forward thinking that has become our hallmark and looks beyond the near term industry challenges to see the opportunity, an opportunity we believe, we are the best positioned to convert into value for our shareowners, our customers and broader society. Thanks and I\u2019ll turn the time back over to Laura for the Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks Pierre. With that, we\u2019d like to open the call for questions. As we typically do, I will ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You are always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up. Christine, I think we are ready for questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Due to time constraints, we ask that all callers limit themselves to one question. If you have additional questions, you may re-queue and those questions will be addressed time permitting. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. Hugh a question on your Dicamba investments, pretty sizable investments, you talked about getting a reasonable return on investment, is that return on investment based on just the chemistry itself or is that considering the roughly $6 fee you\u2019re going to get on Xtend, so just wondering how big an opportunity Dicamba as a chemistry can be for you going forward?","Hugh Grant","Yes, thanks for the question Don. I think it\u2019s going to be substantial. It is, we said 200 million plus, I wish we had that, today there is tremendous demand out there. As we run the mass from this we looked at both, we looked at the return based on the plan alone and then also the platform opportunity when you enable 200 million plus acres, but Pierre maybe a few more inputs.","Pierre Courduroux","Yes and in both cases and exactly as Hugh mentioned, we\u2019ve been looking at the picture from both perspectives. So as a standalone chemical and as a system and in both cases we are delivering IRRs in the double-digits. So feeling pretty good and obviously including the value of the trait its way higher, so we feel good about the potential return from that project.","Don Carson","Okay, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks Don.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Thank you. Hugh, I think you made a comment that the window of opportunity for Syngenta deal will be measured in months, not years. Obviously Syngenta has shown reluctance to engage to-date. If you\u2019re unable to consummate a deal in coming months, can you speak to your capital allocation thoughts in the wake of that scenario?","In another words would you resume repurchases or might there be other partners of interest in crop protection and also have you considered a partnership with the crop protection producers it means to an end of achieving your integrated solution vision of digital Ag? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Kevin thanks for the question. So call me traditional, but I always think that business gets done when people meet, when they sit down across the table and try and work out a solution and we\u2019ve been singularly unsuccessful in getting Syngenta to sit down and talk. We\u2019ve seen the videos where they talk to themselves, but I'd love to be able to engage in a conversation.","The months versus years, I\u2019ve talked, but there has been a long game. We have tremendous response from the Syngenta shareowners and from combined shareowners between Monsanto and Syngenta. But I think the opportunity is significant and if unsuccessful, this isn\u2019t something we're going to turn into an epic struggle. We will look, we're committed to bringing chemistry up onto those platforms and we would look for other opportunities.","Having said that, either through partnerships or otherwise, having said that, I get the feeling that we haven\u2019t really, we haven\u2019t even run the first lap in this Syngenta discussion yet, but as I said in my prepared comments, there is mounting frustration on both sides of the Atlantic and puzzled why they won\u2019t sit down.","Your second question on capital allocation, we would and then Pierre alluded to this, we would revert back to our commitments in our original plan, but we are keeping our powder dry at the movement until we endeavor to conclude these conversations.","Kevin McCarthy","Understood, I appreciate the thoughts.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Sandy Klugman","Hugh good morning. I was hoping you could discuss the source of the incremental $300 million to $500 million in cost cuts that you\u2019re targeting? And the follow up question is if the environment for growers or FX does improve do you see a scenario where you would potentially pull back on some of those cost reduction targets?","Hugh Grant","Yes, maybe I'll ask Brett to, thanks for your question, I'll maybe ask Brett to say a word on this. Our organization this year has delivered in a tough environment with some significant cost controls. I hope to your point that the environment improves, but as we look at '16, our anticipation is '16 in many ways looks similar to '15. So the prudent thing to do is, plan accordingly and anticipate that we will be taking more disciplined actions, but Brett maybe a word on the sources of those opportunities.","Brett Begemann","Yes, so as you mentioned the discipline that we demonstrated in '15 has been a contributor to our results in '15 and with '16 looking tough we\u2019re planning the same way. And the areas that I mentioned that we\u2019re looking at are process optimization, administrative costs, and I think you can bucket this together also saying leverage and data science as we learn more about it, to drive productivity of our operations in the labs and in the fields and in the marketplace. And those process improvements and optimization all help us to reduce cost and basically make us more efficient at delivering products and services to our customers and that\u2019s where we will be focused.","Sandy Klugman","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, hi good morning.","Hugh Grant","Hi, good morning PJ.","PJ Juvekar","The Scotts Miracle Gro transaction, seemed like a onetime benefit, so why are you including that in your ongoing EPS guidance? And then secondly, Pierre last quarter you explained that the fourth quarter EPS would be 15% to 20% of second half earning and now fourth quarter is expected to be breakeven, so what changed in the last three months?","Pierre Courduroux","So PJ and this is actually I mean, both questions are related and its really looking into what we said at the end of the second quarter was we are contemplating a number of licensing opportunities, I mean in both seeds and genomics and our productivity actually. And what we're seeing is the first one to materialize actually quicker than what we anticipated was the Scotts transaction and that\u2019s really part of our business model.","We\u2019ve always been, I mean really pursuing those opportunities and we do believe there are further opportunities down the road that we are going to be tracing. So based on where we are today and as I mentioned during the prepared remark, we don\u2019t see any of those opportunities translating into the fourth quarter. However, as I said we still see potential for some of those, I mean happening in '16 and maybe beyond that.","So this is the licensing part of the question, regarding and obviously this has an impact on the quarter-to-quarter because you see a benefit in Q3 and as we mentioned we had a place holder of more than $100 million in Q4 that now disappears. And we said as well that I mean the market condition and especially the beginning of the season in South America, I mean what we hear from Argentina right now is that acres are going to be down, so we want to be a realistic about how we think about the fourth quarter and this is really how we came to this revised guidance.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Was there a revenue benefit to Ag productivity from the Scotts deal and if there was, how much was that? And secondly, if you spent a $1 billion to expand dicamba capacity, how many gallons do you get for $1 billion?","Pierre Courduroux","So, I will take the first part of the question regarding the Scotts transaction. So there was definitely a benefit in terms of the revenue in Ag productivity and this is very close actually to this $274 million recorded in terms of gross profit. I don\u2019t have the exact number, but these are fairly close to each other.","Hugh Grant","And then Jeff, the second question on dicamba, so we said the three to five-year investment stream. So the front end of this will be the fin end as we do engineering and early spec-ing. The market so 20% Brett, 30%?","Brett Begemann","Yes, it will be in that range and part of this is the investment and the basic infrastructure to prepare for the development, so you could add additional capacity for far less cost after the initial installation is put in place, you could add another train.","Pierre Courduroux","Somewhere in the 20% to 30% range would be although future markets demand, because the market today is quite small, but and classic Monsanto fashion we'll be creating that market and then supplying it, but that would be a rough guideline.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning, David.","David Begleiter","On corn gross profit, given the pressure on gross margins next year from lower acres or production, can you still, is it possible to grow corn gross profit next year, given the pressure on margins?","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, I mean we are - and Pierre mentioned that sometimes production and we didn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve seen acres skinny and down in Latin America. So the early read there is acres are going to be crimped. What we\u2019re anticipating, you look at the challenges this year in corn, so we are anticipating that next year will be a tighter market and more blessed within this, so we\u2019ve got balance portfolio. So what we\u2019re losing in corn we\u2019re seeing really a nice uptake in beans, but maybe a little better on how you see margin and as the growth opportunities next year?","Hugh Grant","Yes, I think they are really good news in this in corn as I mentioned, our portfolio is as strong as it's been. We continued to see farmers migrating to our best hybrids, in other words our newest hybrids, which gives us the opportunity to continued to get portfolio mix lift from our germplasm and we believe that that\u2019s going to continue.","We will continue to face the headwinds of acres. And when we face the headwinds of acres and the softness that Pierre mentioned in South America, that translates into an impact in COGS because it lowers our production and the absorption of our fixed cost. So, we feel really good about our position going into '16. Albeit it's going to be a challenging market, not unlike what '15 was and that\u2019s going to have an impact on margins and we'll be a lot more clear on that as we start to finalize the projections for '16.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect, thank you. Regarding your channel brand in seeds, I mean growth initiatives, can you update us on the potential margin improvement here and the best way to think about this geographically, are there any U.S. regional limitations? And also, is the portfolio refresh here done at the same rate as DEKALB? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","So nice, so Chris we from an operational point of view it seems really good improvements in the channel piece. I\u2019m not sure, service the growers and operational level, but didn\u2019t effect, convert yet into a margin uptake Brett.","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think the primary focus with the change that we made in channel was change in the relationship and experience with the customer to provide better service and real time management of inventories in season. So, and that\u2019s gone really well. We feel good about how we made that transition.","It really wasn\u2019t intended to be a significant margin improvement. There could be a little bit as we continued to improve our overall service there. To your other part of your question, do we refresh the channel brand like we do DEKALB, each of those decisions are made independently, but yes, we do refresh the channel brand and we do bring new products into that portfolio every year just like we do in DEKALB and those metrics would be very similar between those two brands.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Joel Jackson","And again, talking but how you\u2019re giving at month [ph] to try to have Syngenta feel done, what has to happen though, is it a possibility that you could look at an unsolicited offer that you take directly to Syngenta shareholders, how long would you have to wait to have that happened and what would have to happen for that to be a suitable outcome?","Hugh Grant","I think there is a miles in the journey before we get to that. I think the first step in this and I\u2019m very encouraged by the early progress, but the first step in this is direct engagement with their shareowners and explaining as I\u2019ve done this morning and the vision that we see for this, there has been a lot of talk around these integrated solutions there has not been much success historically.","And I think that more we talk about the difference between talking and doing, the more interest there is in the vision and the strategy. So I think for us the nearest item [ph] is the continued outreach to their shareowners and the continued outreach to Syngenta to encourage them to sit down and do this face to face rather than through YouTube and leaked documents. And I'm hoping that we get to a point where we\u2019re actually sitting and talking.","Your pass is there is always a potential, but my preference would be a friendly deal with the two Chairmen of these two companies.","Joel Jackson","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Thank you, when you talk about additional upfront licensing fees potentially in '16 is this more Xtend Dicamba related or are there other opportunities on Roundup people to decide or discuss?","Hugh Grant","Yes, John thanks for the question. I mean, we\u2019ve been doing this for years. We talked very early on architecture and always expanding our licensing opportunity. The one that this front and field trials this year that I would and Pierre kind of alluded to this in his comments, is corn rootworm fee, so it's next generation corn rootworm control. We have and collaborate a trial, they will be doing root digs in the next few weeks, when we can go out of the rain and see ground drying out, so that\u2019s one that I would probably put front and foremost.","John Roberts","Right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Koort","Thanks very much. On the Dicamba investment, I\u2019m curious on the interim before your own facility starts, have you would source that given I think you\u2019re going to use the new formulation or reduce the volatilization and will it be a branded product and managed in the same manner you manage Roundup?","Hugh Grant","Yes, so the short answer will be yes, but Brett let me just add a little bit of flavor around it. We've done a lot of work in formulations. We're encouraged there and also third party supplies and collaborators.","Brett Begemann","Yes, so the way we\u2019re looking at this Bob is, we're if you think about this in stages getting the products into the marketplace and there is an update that came about there that already supplies about 20% of the market and we are sourcing some of that. You may recall some months ago we made the announcement of an investment and our marketing facility and a formulation plan, where yes we are making our own branded products that we\u2019re going to sell in the marketplace and it is an advanced formulation that brings benefit to the farmer.","So we\u2019ll do that from sourced material and the near term and will continued to do that and until we build our own capacity and bring that online, but along the way we\u2019ll continue to use some of those sources that are out there, that are already have Dicamba, so it will be a combination of all of those.","Bob Koort","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Bob thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. I might have missed this because I had to hop off for a second, but did you talk at all about any progress update on getting the Chinese approval for Xtend?","Brett Begemann","We did not. We\u2019ve seen nice progress in Europe and China will, as is traditional in the case, China will be the last piece of this process to come through, but no new news, but I mean our experience has been China has usually been the last piece of this, but China has generally been pretty predictable and they need be, so we feel pretty optimistic but no news Vincent.","Vincent Andrews","Is there a go or no go date by which you need approval in order to be confident for next year?","Brett Begemann","We don\u2019t necessarily think of it as a go or no go date. We\u2019re producing seed this year with the anticipation that we will be in the market in 2016. So that I guess I would call that already ago. As we get closer to 2016 with the anticipated approval out of China we'll make those decisions on how we manage that next year with, but that will be decisions that will be made in conjunction with our grower customers and the rest of the industry sitting down and working together on this and decide what we do. But at this point our focus is totally on the China approval. We've provided them all the information necessary to make their decision. So we'll stay focused on driving that decision so that we don\u2019t have to address the other side of it.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks very much.","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Connelly","Good morning. So couple of quarters back I asked you about your confidence broadly in getting paid in Argentina, and since then most the news flows the same as always just chaotic and negative and you mentioned the POD and the 70% of farmers are paying upfront. So my question is, do you think we\u2019re headed towards a model where we pay upfront across Brazil and Argentina and are you thinking any differently about the safe seed issue in soya in Argentina given what the government has been saying?","Hugh Grant","Mark, thanks for the questions. So I think your summary on the news flow looks the same as always. It is chaotic. I think it just is life in Argentina, when you get down there and you talk to growers, there is tremendous enthusiasm and a pent up demand for these technologies and the other ones are coming down the pike.","So, you have to kind of claim above the noise and look at the microenvironment and I think the evidence and your point is exactly right, the evidence says we\u2019re seeing growers more and more towards buying new bags, but the bags still for POD continues to be important. And Brett, you have been looking at this for last few weeks.","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think, I would just remind you to think about the early months and years when we put this system in place in Brazil, it was pretty noisy there too. And I think we're hearing a lot of same thing out of Argentina. But there is as Hugh mentioned tremendous interest in the product and what we've seen in Brazil and I\u2019m not suggesting it will be an exact carbon copy of Argentina, but I think it will be the right flavor as POD got in place, farmers became more comfortable buying new seed every year because they see the value.","They see the value and high quality planning seed and when they\u2019re getting better yields and they\u2019re buying better seed, they put better seed treatments on et cetera, et cetera. So I think we\u2019ll see the same thing overtime in Argentina. The POD system has clearly an important backstop there that makes sure we have that in place and it will be noisy, but we\u2019re still confident that it will move in the right direction.","Mark Connelly","Very helpful, thank you.","Hugh Grant","No, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Brett Wong","Great, thanks for fitting me in here at the end. Just talking about Climate growth you never really talked about that at all, just wondering the step up in orders you saw this past month, what was leading that where the Climate Pro users is that around more favorable pricing? And then on top of that as you look at how that product offering ramps, how do you see kind of the scale up in ramping product and pricing can be back? Thanks.","Hugh Grant","So, I\u2019ll ask Brett to give you a little bit of granular detail. Let me just start with saying we are delighted with the progress. It isn\u2019t financially material yet, but it does improvement the system and the link to my earlier comments on Syngenta, what we're seeing this year with some of the nitrogen this is still early, what we\u2019re seeing this year with some of the Nitrogen Advisor work, I think bridge is beautifully into bringing chemistry up on an acre. So what we do nitrogen, there is the opportunity in the future was chemistry and giving the farmer much better advice on when and how he applies chemistry, but so early days Brett, but some great numbers on the board.","Brett Begemann","Yes, we are really excited about it. If you look at the early days of the Climate Pro, which were the paid acres this year, I\u2019d say it was driven by the nitrogen model which gave farmers, lots of insights particularly in some areas this year that were kindly difficult with the early planning season and lots of rain et cetera in some areas so that played very well.","And then the shift which was just as exciting as how much interest there was in the Field Health Advisor this year which was the other big app that we had available on that paid system this year and that one really gets that worked. He was describing as thinking about field help in the field help and farmers make the decisions in raising the crop through the rest of the year and its really impressive to see the interest from farmers that it confirms again the farmer's understand intuitively. They have this variability in the field and they believe that it can be addressed and they\u2019re willing to work with us to figure out how to do that. So, it is an exciting start with that platform.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Frank Mitsch","Hi thanks guys for taking the question. This is actually Rory Brakin [ph] for Frank Mitsch. I just had a couple of quick ones. On the dicamba side I thought that we were still waiting for regulatory approval on the in crop use, is there any update there?","And then also just changing gears a little on the crop, on the Climate Corporation side, obviously a nice number on the free offering, a nice number on the premium offering, how should we think about the adoption rate and is there any change in how we\u2019re thinking about pricing for it? Thanks again guys.","Hugh Grant","I\u2019m sorry on the same piece adoption rate on what sorry?","Frank Mitsch","The adoption rate on the Pro side and also the pricing of it?","Hugh Grant","Okay. Well I think there is still two pieces in there on the dicamba side, I believe you are referring to the chemistry over-the-top label and we \u2013 that is work in process and we\u2019re optimistic on that one. We've put cotton in the marketplace this year and because we had three herbicide tolerances there where the farmer could use two of them this year and that\u2019s what we used to kind of set the tone on pricing, but we feel really good with our U.S. approach on the over-the-top for dicamba.","The other piece on Climate Pro, there are two things and I think it's, I'm still in the camp that says the most important thing is to develop the robust platform for data scientists for farmers and it\u2019s less about how much profitability we can get in the early years and how much pricing there is in the early years. It\u2019s about getting farmers established on a platform that helps them improve the decision making both before planting, at planting and throughout raising the crop and that\u2019s going to continue to be our focus.","Obviously farmers are demonstrating they see value in it and they are paying for those services this year and we\u2019ll continue to look at the value that we bring and price into that, but the primary focus in the next couple of years will be continuing to expand that platform.","Pierre Courduroux","I think that platform play data becomes the glue that holds the chemistry, the seeds and the biotech together and we are uniquely positioned and it reminds me so much of the early days of scepticism in biotech and them scepticism in linking biotech and breeding and even the scepticism when we change platforms with twos and with SmartStax. So we\u2019ve going to have to demonstrate that and I would expect and demonstrate that we can bring these technologies together, we get the opportunity one more time to license that to the rest of the chemical industry.","Frank Mitsch","Thanks again guys.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks for the question.","Laura Meyer","Christine this is Laura, to be mindful of the time, we\u2019ll take one more question before we pass it to Hugh for the close.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Piken","Yes hi, I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on some of the restructuring in terms of some of the buckets that you are anticipating coming from and specifically are you planning to cut R&D as well or is it more OpEx spending? Thanks.","Pierre Courduroux","It\u2019s more, it\u2019s much more focused and Brett mentioned went through some of this earlier, but it is much more on driving efficiency and the use of new technologies and R&D this year, we quietly retooled a big piece of breeding and we think our breeding programs will be faster, will yield more and cost less. So we actually use the surrogate as we look other opportunities across the company. But as the application, the data science, the number of yields that we think we can streamline and get better and faster.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Grant, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Hugh Grant","So thanks, thank you very much and thanks, we\u2019ve stayed all but long today so thanks for your patience and your support. I guess in summary, I would say our business and our pipeline are stronger than they have ever been and yet and this is classic Monsanto we continue to challenge ourselves to advance new solutions and provide an even more robust tools for farmers around the globe regardless of their size.","So with the proposal, I started talking about today, our proposal to combine with Syngenta, we are looking beyond the short pattern micro challenges that face agriculture to once again drive the next evolution.","Many in the industry have theorized there has been a lot of integrated strategies, but I think as I said earlier, there is a difference between talking and doing, and we believe we\u2019re best positioned with our strong seed footprint and our leading Digital Ag platform to make this a reality providing us with an opportunity to be even stronger partner to growers.","So we simply have the proven track record, the demands, consideration to be the partner of choice and leading this evolution we appreciate the continued support of the respect of owners in driving that dialogue, driving that engagement. So I wanted to conclude by thanking you for joining us on the call today. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

[Operator instructions.]  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Bryan Hurley, investor relations lead for Monsanto.  Thank you Mr. Hurley, you may begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks a lot, operator, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings update. I\u2019m joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our chairman and CEO; by Brett Begemann, our president and chief commercial officer; and Pierre Courduroux, our CFO.  Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann and Manny Cruz","As usual, this call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address. We're providing you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are posted to our website. ","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results.  Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.","With this call, we\u2019ll focus on our second earnings guidance increase in as many quarters.  That\u2019s a function of a strong quarter and continued strong business performance.  Hugh will start today with an overview of our strategy and how we\u2019re thinking about growth this year and for the long term.  From there, we\u2019ll have Brett Begemann walk you through the operational drivers that underscore our business performance.  And finally, Pierre will bring that together in the translation to our current financials and our guidance outlook.","With that, let me hand it over to Hugh.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line.  The second quarter is always an important quarter for us.  This year, I tell you, this second quarter is more important, both because our business results confirm the early momentum that we saw building and because we achieved breakthroughs on a couple of key strategic targets that reinforce the runway for our long term opportunity.","I\u2019ll let Brett walk you through the details of the operational milestones.  I want to focus on our business today fits into our overall strategy.  There\u2019s four areas I want to emphasize.  First, in the near term, an earlier than typical sales season has created a better line of sight that allows us to raise our full year outlook for the second time.  ","That comes together on slide five, as we raise our earnings guidance range today to $4.40 to $4.50 of ongoing EPS.  That provides an earlier than usual punctuation mark on the year and it reinforces our expectation for a third consecutive year of growth above our original projections.","That growth also comes after we\u2019ve previously excluded from our outlook the historical range of approximately $0.20 to $0.25 of full year EPS associated with the Brazil Roundup Ready 1 soybean trait.  So, our bottom line business outlook today means the momentum that we anticipated in our first quarter has clearly carried through into even stronger business results for the second quarter.","And that really sets up my second point.  As we look at our business results this year in context of the longer term, we\u2019ve turned the corner as a global business.  We\u2019re a yield company, so what propels us today is the strength of a truly global business, not just one driver, and you can see that on slide six.","We have good momentum in the U.S., we\u2019re on the front edge of some significant acceleration in Latin America, and we\u2019re bringing a couple of new layers of growth into our business each year.  And the strength in our global portfolio in fiscal \u201913 reinforces our confidence in the growth opportunity that continues beyond this year.","Thirdly, we\u2019ve always focused our strategy on those elements that we can influence, and this quarter we made some strategic moves that reduce uncertainty, provide clarity, and reinforce key elements of our ongoing growth.  ","The biggest of those were our efforts to take a step forward with our deal with Brazilian customers around the Roundup Ready 1 technology and most recently our deal with DuPont, adding them as a new licensee for our Roundup Ready 2 Yields and Roundup Ready 2 Extend platforms in soybeans.  ","The Dupont agreement is a major breakthrough that allows us to put the marketplace noise behind us while we expand customer choice by making our innovations available to more farmers and more brands.  Strategically, the deal validates our Roundup Ready 2 Yields and our new Extend technologies and it expands the total opportunity for both of these.  And that\u2019s backed by the financials, as we have a long term customer that consolidates a key piece of the growth that we\u2019ve anticipated.","And lastly, as good as I feel about this year, I feel equally good about the opportunity that comes as we take the concept of a total package of yield to the next level in our pipeline.  Today, we have more platforms that will drive yield than ever before.  ","You can see that in slide seven.  This year, we make the first step into precision agriculture as our first integrated farming systems offering moves into groundbreaker trials in the U.S.  Behind that, we have significant pipeline upgrades to broad acre traits, other completely new platforms, like our BioDirect technology, and an increasing powerful package of new technologies that we expect will step up yield every year from now through the end of this decade.","I\u2019ll end on the point that agriculture provides a compelling stage for innovators like Monsanto.  If you set aside the usual back and forth on annual acres, yields, and prices, what becomes a pattern is the prospect that the growing global demand for grain is creating an opportunity for us to create a lot more cumulative value in the next decade.","We are well-positioned to do just that.  As I look at what we\u2019ve accomplished so far this year, we have clarity in this quarter and that enables us to raise our EPS guidance range, the high end of which would represent a third consecutive year of greater than 20% ongoing EPS growth.  That\u2019s an important indicator of our momentum and our performance.","But it\u2019s also the foundation for a strategy going forward, as we have the global business strength to add even more layers to our opportunities over the next several years.  I have to tell you that I\u2019m delighted with the trajectory of our global businesses, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ve got the right balance of innovation, continued increased customer focus, and operational execution to propel our profitability forward.","So Brett\u2019s right in the front line of those opportunities, so he\u2019s in the best position to walk you through these drivers in a bit more detail.  Brett?","Brett Begemann ","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone.  As Hugh said, my focus is on driving growth in our global business.  I\u2019ll anchor on one point Hugh made: We\u2019ve turned an important corner as a global business, and that global growth is exactly what is driving our strong performance this year.  So it\u2019s worth highlighting how we see it come together, not just for this year\u2019s results, but also for the strategic opportunity it creates going forward.","Part of the strength of a growing business is the supporting ensemble, and for us, that\u2019s the advantage we realize from our ag productivity segment.  Ag productivity and the Roundup business in particular has emerged nicely from our strategy reset a few years ago.  Our strategy allows us to capture the upside of a rejuvenated market environment while significantly reducing the impact of volatility of the historical, cyclical side of our business.","But what really drives the incremental opportunity in our business is when we deploy our portfolio to create yield and value for our farmer customers on a global scale.  You can see that best back on slide six.  We are continuing to drive yield in core geographies, taking that proven success into emerging markets and unlocking completely new sources of growth through our unmatched R&D pipeline.","If we zero in on our 2013 drivers, we can see how this plays out in the momentum we\u2019ve talked about in our business.  Start with the single biggest driver of our performance this year, our corn business, and make no mistake, this is one of the most global businesses which really is highlighted as you skip to slide eight.","With the Southern Hemisphere seasons largely in hand, and early insight into the Northern Hemisphere corn season, there\u2019s no doubt that our corn business is having an extremely strong year.  Here are the metrics that matter.  ","We\u2019re growing our global volumes.  In fact, we expect to hit record total volumes in our corn business in 2013, driving a key increment of our growth.  I believe that\u2019s a direct outcome of our conscious focus on our farmer customers.  We\u2019ve taken the feedback from our customers to heart, staying true to our deliberate approach to pricing and are focused on providing the best performing products. It also is important over the long term as this modest pricing approach means we\u2019re not pricing to the highs and lows of a commodity price market that is certain to fluctuate over time.  ","The second benefit that shines through is the power of a global upgrade, which you see prominently on this same slide.  Every year, we upgrade a significant portion of our portfolio across the largest geographies with the newest, highest value hybrids.  That annual refreshment has the effect of lifting our corn portfolio prices on a global level every year.  This annual germplasm refresh allows us to grow price and volume, and together, that creates a blockbuster effect, generating more than $2.3 billion of corn seed sales growth across the key geographies in the last decade.","If we focus in on the drivers for 2013, our second quarter now reflects the conclusion of the second season in Latin America, and that punctuates the strong results we saw in Q1.  If you go to slide nine, in a country like Brazil the power of our corn story lies in the compounding upgrade as we expand both the trait penetration while simultaneously upgrading to next-generation traits.  ","As the Brazil season wraps up, we saw a record safrinha planting season, and record volume for our business.  That acreage growth in safrinha likely continues over time, and that\u2019s a positive for our business as we\u2019ve historically done well in that season.  ","This opportunity also shows the trait trend isn\u2019t a one-shot benefit.  We\u2019re in the first phase of introducing traits into Brazil.  Coming behind today\u2019s traits are additional multi-trait stacks that we\u2019ll add on top of today\u2019s best products, creating a runway for upgrades we expect carries over the next half decade.","Those same core drivers show up in the Northern Hemisphere, and in particular in the U.S., on slide 10.  We made an earlier than usual call on our view on acres on particular with last year\u2019s 96 million to 97 million acres.  Now within range of actual planting, that early call feels spot on, something reinforced in last year\u2019s USDA outlook.","Without last year\u2019s head start, and with some of the rain and snow in the last few weeks, farmers won\u2019t be able to get in the fields as quickly this year, so the conditions through the planting season will be important in getting to the final acres.  Obviously, last year\u2019s drought will also play out in this year\u2019s crop, and going into planting, farmers still need to replenish a lot of moisture through the season.  ","Likewise, with the drought negatively hitting last summer\u2019s seed production across the corn belt, it\u2019s a tight market across the industry.  We\u2019ve worked with our distribution and we feel good about having the portfolio of seed to meet the needs of our farmer customers against that projected market.  One of the benefits of our portfolio is the broad availability of RIB products, giving farmers even more flexibility and speed in getting their acres in this year.  ","Importantly, the strength we saw in our early order book is also apparent in the financials this quarter.  This is setting up to be another strong year for our U.S. corn seed business, as we project another year of growth.  ","The biggest driver of that growth is the mix benefit coming from our upgrades, and those have been in high demand.  In fact, we\u2019re on track to be at the high end of the original target of 36 to 38 million acres in our Reduced-Refuge family.  And within that, there\u2019s a compounding benefit, both the upgrade from the older products to the Reduced-Refuge family, and the upgrade within the family, as highest-performing, highest-value products are most in demand.  ","In particular, with the good yield performance last year, we\u2019ve seen strong demand for our top-tier Genuity SmartStax product, as it now is the largest-volume product for the Reduced-Refuge family in our own brands.","The other major factor that straddles our current core markets and new emerging opportunities is the soybean business, on slide 11.  With Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, we\u2019ve talked about the key elements of soybeans.  However, we\u2019re on the verge of seeing the cumulative power of our next-generation soybean platform drive our financials.","On this slide, you see that there are 200 million acres of soybeans planted in North and South America.  With a [fit] on every one of those acres, we expect the successive platforms of Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Intacta and then Roundup Ready 2 Extend, to come together as a multi-billion dollar driver in the next five years.","This year, we\u2019ll touch more than 40 million acres with Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S., but only about 20% of this opportunity.  That means in the next five years, we expect to see significant upgrades that have a practical fit on the remaining 160 million acres.","Here\u2019s how I think about that rollout.  Going into the U.S. this season, our soybean business is in a very strong position.  The early order book is translating well into shipments, and we\u2019re positioned to see the next step up of Roundup Ready 2 Yield.  Just as we\u2019re seeing with the Reduced Refuge family in corn, the strong demand for Roundup Ready 2 Yield means we now expect this year\u2019s acres to come in at the high end of our original 39 to 41 million acre range.  ","This is also the primary area where the strategic breakthrough that Hugh mentioned reinforces our opportunity.  I\u2019m pleased to have Dupont on board as a customer for Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Roundup Ready 2 Extend.","Strategically, it provides an important confirmation of the platform status of these technologies for the industry.  Just as importantly, it immediately expands the U.S. opportunity for both Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Extend, confirming the first phase of this multiyear runway.  And financially, it carries more than a billion dollars of value that dovetails in for the U.S. soybeans and reinforces the growth on that element over an extended period of time.   ","The next significant phase of that runway comes as we take another step closer to commercializing the first of our new 100 million acre soybean opportunities with Intacta in Brazil, on slide 12.  Ahead of Intacta, we also continue to put our effort behind an orderly wind down of Roundup Ready 1 soybeans in Brazil.  I believe we\u2019ll continue to see back and forth on Roundup Ready 1, but I think we\u2019ve made the right strategic steps to help transition, work with our customers, and direct our focus to Intacta.","Intacta is the opportunity I tell my teams to spend their energy on.  The reason Intacta is so compelling is because it\u2019s a step change in performance, and the new data we have today in the early results from our second year of groundbreakers data in Brazil.  Just like last year, we\u2019re seeing the performance we expected, with a better than four bushel per acre advantage on more than 1,000 locations, double the number of locations that we tested last year.  ","With two years of data on real customer fields, it\u2019s clear that the performance is there, and the excitement among customers is tangible.  That sets up very nicely as we look to take Intacta to the first increment of commercial scale in Brazil\u2019s summer season.  There\u2019s still some work to do, but we\u2019re in very good shape to move on this 100 million acre $1 billion plus opportunity.  ","On the heels of Intacta will be our Roundup Ready 2 Extend technology.  It moves into groundbreakers this season in the U.S., and we really see this over the next five years as another increment that adds to the Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Intacta bases to top off that big soybean opportunity in the Americas.","Taken together, this is really the first time we\u2019ve talked about the cumulative opportunity for our next-generation soybean platform, and the total opportunity makes this one of our biggest growth drivers, and the early milestones are right on track.  ","The same core point would be true as we look at the whole business.  Our milestones are on track and the momentum we anticipated has clearly materialized.  The last couple of years have been important in confirming our strategy and reigniting growth, so I am pleased to see that play out in fiscal \u201913 as well.  That\u2019s a function of the effort we\u2019ve made to connect with our farmer customers, and that continues to be a priority for me and my teams.","With that, let me have Pierre walk through how all of this comes together in the financials.  Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux ","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everybody on the line.  Hugh and Brett covered the strategic business drivers that influence our full year guidance, so I will now concentrate on a focused review of some of the key year to date financial elements, and how they translate [unintelligible] to our original plans.","But before I go into the details, let me highlight, on slide 13, how I think about the full year outlook at this point.  First, we are very pleased with our results, both on the quarter and for the year to date.  This year has been unique in providing us an earlier than usual view in our first two quarters, and that\u2019s what gives me confidence as we take our full year guidance higher today.  We\u2019ve locked in the key increments of growth we expected from South America and in the early U.S. season, and that really sets the course for our full year growth.  ","Second, the results really show the power of an increasingly global business.  This is the most significant factor I see in the results.  Operating a business in agriculture, we will be facing variability that ranges from weather effects to geographic swings every year.  So having a leading business in multiple geographies and built on multiple technology platforms matters.  If you look at our financials this year, that geographic balance is apparent, as we continue to be on track with our full year growth, split roughly equally in between the U.S. and international.  ","And lastly, as the strong business performance also translates into our cash flow statements, we\u2019re evolving our cash deployment approach as we look to return more value to our share owners.  If I translate that overview into the specifics of the financials, the best way to see the portfolio effect I just mentioned is to focus on the year to date numbers.  ","Start with year to date sales, which increased more than $1.2 billion, driving the top line growth that sets the tone for our overall earnings.  That translates into a gross profit growth as well, as year to date GP was over $4.4 billion, an increase of approximately 18% over the same point last year. As we increase our full year guidance today, it flows through from our combined full year expectations for GP, which we would expect now in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.75 billion.","Consistent with our strategy, and as we\u2019ve become a bigger company, EBIT has become the most relevant metric to monitor our overall growth.  Importantly, we see leveraging EBIT as we grow our above the line components faster than our operating expenses.  As a result, year to date EBIT margins have grown nearly 3 points, and that puts us on a trajectory to grow our overall EBIT margins for the third consecutive year.","If you look at what drives year-to-year growth, there are a couple of clear factors.  First, on the seed and genomics side, the largest overall contributor, and the largest driver of growth, is our global corn business.  Year to date corn sales have grown by 19%, reflecting the strength of our overall business and the uptick we saw in our early order book.  That is nearly two-thirds of the overall sales growth for the company, which reaffirms the role this key driver has in our over portfolio.","It also puts us in a very good position at the halfway point for our expectations of meeting full year strong growth for corn.  This corn performance is really a function of our global footprint, as we are seeing the cumulative volume gain and mix benefits from Latin America from our core U.S. business and from other key geographies like Europe.","Practically, for the full year, we expect double-digit gross profit growth in corn, and I also expect margins to [unintelligible] pretty well, in line with last year, or up slightly.  And this, even in a year where cost of goods come in at one of the highest points in the last decade, reflecting the impact of last year\u2019s drought and winter production costs. These cost pressures impact our financial, but give us the business flexibility to make sure we have the seed to supply our farmer customers.  ","That corn upside is complemented by the continued benefit we see in ag productivity.  Fundamentally, the benefit that we saw in the first quarter continues to track in this quarter and in our full year outlook, and we project full year GP to further increase, putting it in the range of $1.35 to $1.4 billion.","The upside continues to be driven by glyphosate pricing, as a result of the earlier increases in generic prices.  Now that we\u2019re well into the U.S. portion of the volume, we feel very good about the outlook for the ag productivity segments.  While we recognize the current strong environment will subside some over time, the current sales levels give us a good view on the continued contribution through the end of the year and a solid line of sight for ag productivity into our fiscal year \u201914.","If you look at the other earnings drivers, both above and below the line, they are tracking in line with our early expectations.  The second quarter is relatively small for other businesses within seeds and genomics, but all fit with our [unintelligible] expectations.  ","Within that, the area to highlight would be soybeans.  As we covered in our first quarter call, our guidance excludes the historical range of approximately $0.20 to $0.25 of full year EPS from Roundup Ready 1 soybeans in Brazil, and you can see that effect in the soybean gross profit for the quarter.  ","In the second quarter, we have seen strong growth in the U.S. as we\u2019ve seen the mix benefit from the upgrades on Roundup Ready 2 Yield, but that positive effect was offset as the second quarter, along a Q3, is one of the two large quarters where the Brazil soybean contribution would historically flow through our P&L.  ","Below the line, our total operating expenses track very well against the targets we gave with our initial guidance.  As a result, we see no changes there, and would expect to see the continuation of positive earnings leverage.  ","As I look at the remainder of the year, it also tracks in line with our previous expectations.  As we balance the continued momentum in corn and ag productivity against the effect of Roundup Ready soybeans in Brazil and the expected lower overall cotton acres, this gives us a clear line of sight for full year growth, reaching a third consecutive year of greater than 20% on the high end.","From the standpoint of cash, the strong business results position us for another year of strong cash generation, as reflected on slide 14.  With the early flow of cash resulting from the strong economy and the early ordering season in the U.S., our year to date results keep us on track to meet our guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash for the year.","That strong cash position creates an opportunity for us on cash deployment.  I\u2019ve said that my first priority is to aggressively reinvest in the business to support the continued growth opportunity.  We\u2019ve been true to that commitment, investing approximately $2.4 billion in total over the last three years on capex and targeted investments.  ","Strategically, we have begun to step up our capex investments this year in those areas Hugh noted as having the best growth potential within our seeds business.  This capex is important for our next round of global growth and offers some of the lowest risk, and highest return on the investment, for our cash deployments.","The next priority for me is the strength of our balance sheet, which matters, as I want to maintain the resources and flexibility to be in a good position to address the cyclicality and potential variability inherent to agriculture.  And in fact, today we\u2019re at a point where further strengthening our balance sheet wouldn\u2019t create further meaningful benefit.  ","Based on our analysis, and with feedback we\u2019ve gotten from many of our owners, we are now moving to use the cash over and above our current levels to further prioritize our share buyback and dividend programs.  We continue to view dividends as an important element of our cash deployment strategy.  ","Over the last three years, we\u2019ve increased our dividend by more than 40%, and as we continue to grow our business, dividends will remain a priority.  Most directly, our historical practice has been to use share buybacks to offset dilution.  As a function of our available cash, we are shifting to using our buyback program more opportunistically, in a way that we expect to begin to reduce share count.  ","We back this new approach with our early actions.  We bought back $300 million of shares in the second quarter as we aggressively make progress against tour current $1 billion share buyback authorization.  We will continue to focus on this tactical buyback and expect to see the early share count reduction in this fiscal year.  ","Taken together, we\u2019ve used approximately $3.3 billion of our free cash on share buybacks and dividends in the past three years.  That\u2019s almost three quarters of our total free cash flow during that period, and I continue to like our ability to be a company with strong underlying growth that generates a strong cash stream we can use for additional capital return.","Let me conclude by stepping back from the numbers for a moment.  I\u2019d summarize by telling you that there are two things I take away from this quarter.  First, the quarter is an important punctuation mark.  It confirms the momentum we anticipated, and gives us a unique line of sight to be able to raise our full year guidance and lock in our expectation for a third consecutive year of strong growth.  And second, this strength is a direct result of a growing global business.  ","That business performance sets up nicely for a strong year, for our continuing growth opportunity, and for the ability to return compelling value to our share owners.  Thanks for your time, and with that, let me turn it over to Brian for Q&A.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Pierre.  We have Hugh, Pierre, and Brett Begemann here as we open the call to your questions.  As we typically do, I\u2019ll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible.  You\u2019re always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow up question.  So, operator, I think we\u2019re ready to take any questions that may be on the line at this point.  ","Operator","Thank you.  [Operator instructions.]  Our first question is coming from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Question on your gross profit guidance.  You\u2019ve gone up $50 million to $100 million from your previous guidance, yet Roundup\u2019s gone up by more than that.  So I\u2019m just wondering, what\u2019s happening in the seed genomics business.  Is the Brazilian loss larger than you thought on the last quarter?  And then just how sustainable is this surge in Roundup?","Hugh Grant ","I\u2019ll maybe ask Pierre to give a little bit of color on gross profit, but overall, delighted with global corn performance.  A bit of softness in Brazilian beans, but completely in line with what we anticipated in the first quarter.  And then I\u2019ll maybe come back and say a little bit on Roundup as well.  But Pierre, on the seed side?","Pierre Courduroux ","","Regarding our seed gross profit and looking at the second half of the year, the way I\u2019m thinking about that is it\u2019s positioned within a year where we\u2019re going to, for the third year, grow earnings by 20% and a year where at this point in time, nothing has been planted yet in the U.S.  ","Regarding the second half specifically, we expect the key drivers of growth that we saw in the first half to continue and prevail.  So ag productivity still being strong, and obviously our corn business driving growth.  ","And the point which I want to make here is that if you normalize the second half of the year for the impact of Roundup Ready 1 in Brazil, knowing that a large part of the $0.20 to $0.25 of EPS that we excluded from our guidance would be coming in the second half.   So if you normalize our numbers for the large part of that\u2019s Roundup Ready 1.  ","And also, remember that the cotton acres that we\u2019ve been projecting this year and cotton is an event that we sell mostly in Q3, we\u2019ve been anticipating a reduction of those cotton acres of 2 to 3 million acres in the U.S.  So if you take all of those elements together, actually the second half we are projecting represents a fairly nice growth coming from the key drivers that we have seen in the first half, including corn and ag productivity.  ","Hugh Grant ","We\u2019re pleased with where we are.  We\u2019ll feel better when we get some seeds in the ground.  On the glyphosate piece, real briefly, just to put it in context, tracking well with the strategy that we had laid out.  We\u2019ve seen some price increases this year.  Glyphosate, Roundup, would now be tracking in the $10-$12 a gallon range, and would be on the upper end of that $10-12.  And Brett, maybe just a little bit of color on how the 300 million gallons is panning out?","Brett Begemann ","Yeah, exactly.  And as our approach has been for the last few years, with our new strategy, is to focus on selling about 300 million gallons a year, and we\u2019re very much on track to do that.  Also, the emphasis of moving as much as we can to our branded business versus third-party sales, and that continues in a favorable march.  ","And I\u2019d also add, on the ag productivity, specifically the Roundup side, that what we\u2019re really seeing from acid prices in China is a range of $4 to $5 and something on the acid, which is substantially less volatility than what we saw years ago.  So I feel good about our strategy and how it\u2019s playing out.  Recognize that there could be some volatility there, but not like what we\u2019ve seen in historical patterns.  ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","If I could start with one more on glyphosate, have you sold more than 150 million gallons so far in the first half, or less?","Hugh Grant","Yeah, we would have sold more than the halfway mark in the first half.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan ","And then secondly, when would you need Chinese approval for Intacta in order to ship for the second Brazilian soybean season?","Hugh Grant ","We would, as a rule of thumb, if we had it before fiscal year end, so the back end, August, we\u2019d be feeling good for this year.  The first year\u2019s going to be small shipments, or relatively small shipments, anyway, but getting over the line before fiscal year end close would be good news.","Operator","Our next question is coming from PJ Juvekar from Citi.  Please proceed with your question.   ","PJ Juvekar - Citi","You have been consistent with your price discipline, raising your base [unintelligible] prices by 5-10%, I guess over the last few years.  But this new pricing model is not tested in an environment of falling prices.  So if corn were to go down, corn prices were to fall because of yields or whatever, do you think you can raise base pricing 5-10% without upsetting your customers?","Hugh Grant ","Thanks for the question.  I think it\u2019s a truly strategic question.  I would remind you that in previous years, we didn\u2019t chase the peaks on our pricing.  So when corn was set at $8, we never aspired to chase that.  We\u2019ve been consistent in our pricing philosophy.  ","We\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing that with growers, and the feedback from growers, both in terms of how they\u2019ve responded and how they\u2019ve voted with their pocketbooks, I think underscores the consistency that we\u2019ve been stressing.  So our world, we\u2019ve been doing our budget and our forecast, on a $4-6 corn world.  So we were never [unintelligible] those peaks, and we were never pricing against them.  ","I think when you look at the whole ag spectrum, the seed business is in a good place, as you look at some of the commodity pricing that is potentially unfolding.  So you know, never say never, but you look at the early days, when corn was $2 or $3 a bushel, we saw some of the strongest technology penetration curves in that timeframe.  ","So I think, you know, the position that we\u2019ve taken, and the fact that we\u2019ve stuck to that over the last two or three years, I think has been recognized by our grower customers.  ","PJ Juvekar - Citi","Thank you, and I just have a clarification question.  Have you licensed Intacta to any other company?","Hugh Grant ","Yeah, we\u2019ve licensed a number of companies in our space, and we\u2019ve followed the same doctrine that we\u2019ve been pursuing for the last 12, 13 years.  So we\u2019ve been very open about that licensing model.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Can you just talk about the cost of goods sold this year and the movement, or the leverage, or lack thereof, between sales and gross profit and season traits?  Assuming that the seed production costs, logistics costs, next year are less, if you have a somewhat normal crop and production, do you think that leverage will show up next year?  Or how should we be thinking about those costs this year versus next year?","Hugh Grant ","There\u2019s a lot of insight there coming off of the, you know, one of the driest production years in the last decade or so, and it did squeeze us on cost.  But Pierre, maybe you can key off that and how you\u2019re thinking about next year and a more normalized environment?","Pierre Courduroux ","I mean, the way I\u2019m thinking about that Vincent, I\u2019m just looking at our performance this year in the first half, and how we think about the whole year, and what we see is actually that our strategy is working, because you can see specifically regarding corn, we\u2019re looking at top line growth of 19% year-to-year, which means we are growing volume and our pricing strategy is working.  And that\u2019s really the key for us. ","However, as you noticed, this year we are hurt by higher cost of goods, and this is not a surprise, because we knew that coming out of the summer we had last year, where drought definitely impacted our production yield and actually pushed us in using more winter production that in a normal year.  ","So I think your analysis is exactly right.  This is something which is not structural.  This is something which is definitely linked to this unique drought situation that we faced last year, and actually the results we see right now, especially on the top line, where we see volume growth and the leverage we get from price, makes us feel very good about our ability to continue growing.  I mean, the strategy is definitely working there.  ","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley ","But how much were costs of production or logistics above sort of what it should have been normally.  Can you give us any sense of what the hit was this year?","Pierre Courduroux  ","","It\u2019s difficult to evaluate and really quantify, but at this point in time, we\u2019re looking at margins that are roughly flat from a year-to-year perspective, so I think when we were talking about the price lift we were expecting early in the year, I mean, you can back calculate where we should be, hadn\u2019t we had those cost of goods penalties.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.  Please proceed with your question.    ","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","Hugh, you said at one point that we\u2019re at the front edge of significant Latin American growth, and I just wanted to get an update from your perspective as to what\u2019s going on with the Brazilian farmer situation.  I know you signed an agreement in terms of forgiveness of the $0.20 to $0.25 on Roundup Ready 1, in exchange for the full royalties on Intacta, but there\u2019s been some farm groups lobbying against that agreement.  So can you give us an update as to where that stands and how you think that plays out over the next year or so?","Hugh Grant ","","I\u2019ll maybe ask Brett to do the high-speed refresher, but I think the headline news is this is all about Intacta.  We have done another year of groundbreaker trials.  We\u2019ve now got 1,000 growers, and so about 2X the number of growers that we had in last year\u2019s groundbreaker trials, more geographically diverse, and we reconfirmed a 4 bushel gain versus the old technology.  So the gold ring in this, the piece that we\u2019re chasing, is getting impact out there as fast and as broadly as we can.  But Brett, maybe just to Frank\u2019s point, just a quick recap and then what you\u2019re hearing in Brazil from growers?","Brett Begemann ","Yeah, I think I\u2019d step back, and if you think about that front edge, what\u2019s that the front edge of?  Let\u2019s talk about corn.  Two big things happening in corn at the same time, and I know they\u2019re hard to parse out, but we\u2019ve never fully penetrated Brazil corn with biotech.  ","So we have an acceleration of penetration of biotech traits across all the corn acres, and at the same time that we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019re upgrading those biotech acres to a new higher-value biotech trait.  And that\u2019s going to carry on for a number of years.  We have a lot of runway in front of us there.  The same to a lesser extent happens in Argentina with Double PRO going to Triple PRO.","Then, in soybeans, as Hugh was describing, I would tell you that as we talk with farmers, you know, any time you\u2019re going through a transition like this, you\u2019re going to find various perspectives in the marketplace.  I feel really good about where we\u2019re at there.  ","Here\u2019s where we\u2019re at.  Every farmer in Brazil that\u2019s interested in soybeans finds themselves in one of two places.  They\u2019ve either signed an agreement or can sign an agreement to move on from Roundup Ready 1 and focus on Intacta, or we\u2019ve deferred the billing and they won\u2019t be paying until there\u2019s a court resolution.  So every farmer is covered in regards to Roundup Ready 1 in Brazil, and now the focus and energy is on Intacta.  ","And I can\u2019t overstate the excitement of a second year of significant performance coming in on Intacta, as Hugh said.  And I will tell you, as I talk to farmers across South America, the conversation is about Intacta, it\u2019s not about Roundup Ready 1.  So I\u2019m really excited about where their focus is.  And yes, there\u2019ll be some noise, but we\u2019ll make that transition, and I\u2019m excited about where we\u2019re at.  ","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Michael Cox from Piper Jaffray.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray","My first question, or my question, is on glyphosate, and I know that a number of questions have been asked about this.  But I\u2019d be curious what sort of supply response you have started to see, or anticipate seeing, given the price movement in glyphosate, both the wholesale and retail level.","Hugh Grant ","Michael, can you say a bit more on supplier response?","Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray ","From the generic producers, particularly China?","Hugh Grant ","I\u2019d say so far, and in an unpredictable world, it\u2019s been pretty predictable so far, and the spread, what we\u2019ve done with our new strategy over the last few years, we\u2019ve focused on narrowing the spread between us and the generics.  So we\u2019ve moved price that should keep track with that generic volume.  We are about half of the world, the Chinese suppliers are about the other half.  So that\u2019s why I say it\u2019s predictable.  ","But if you look at the volatility in the size of the spreads versus our last experience, as Brett made the point earlier, that\u2019s a lot tighter this time around, Michael.  So still early days in the season, but feeling, with the volume that\u2019s out there, we\u2019re feeling pretty good, and I think we get visibility into \u201914 from where we sit today.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mark Connelly from CLSA.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Mark Connelly - CLSA","Hugh, you\u2019ve made it pretty clear where the big growth is coming from.  I wonder if you could help us understand what the outlook is for the U.S. corn market.  When I look at slide 7, I still see a whole bunch of things in the pipeline there.  Do you look at the U.S. as sort of a steady growth market now, or how should we think about that?  And similarly, if you could just remind us of the timing of vegetables, because you had indicated over the next couple of years that was going to start to hit.","Hugh Grant ","Yeah, so on corn I\u2019m really pleased with the performance this year.  You know, the 36, that 8 million acres, we\u2019re continuing to break through hard goals, and I think there\u2019s some continued steady upgrades there.  The first question this morning was around our germplasm and prices in germplasm.  That\u2019s been a sleeper, but all the feedback that we get from growers is they continue to look for performance regardless of commodity price.  ","And as we continue to drive that performance through the germplasm as well as the traits, we\u2019re rewarded on price.  This year\u2019s a great example.  We sell out of our best performing products early, and we sell out of them every year early.  So growers are focused on performance, and I think that will be the steady drum beat in the U.S.  I don\u2019t know, Brett, if you\u2019ve got anything that you\u2019d add beyond that?  ","Brett Begemann ","No, I think you\u2019ve nailed it.  I think that\u2019s their focus, and I would remind you that we didn\u2019t talk a lot about it today, but that IFS is a very interesting concept that fits corn, and we\u2019re going to be doing groundbreakers with IFS, and that will be an option for us in corn in the U.S. too.","Hugh Grant ","And then veggies, nothing much to report.  Feeling better about it than a year ago, but you know, demand is still soft in some of those world areas.  As we look long term in veggies, I think, and we\u2019ve been talking about this for a couple of years, but as we see the front end of that pipeline emerging, a lot of this in the coming years is going to focus on our ability to add value through pricing, to improve performance on the molecular markers and the improved breeding technologies that we\u2019re seeing coming out of our labs in California, but it\u2019s still ahead of us, I think.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","With regard to the U.S. corn seed market, you\u2019re now pointing to the high end of your 36 to 38 million acre range for the Genuity corn seed family.  It sounds like the USDA\u2019s planting intentions numbers were pretty consistent with your expectations.  So in that context, would you comment on what is driving the move or your confidence to achieve the high end?  Is it having to do with market share expectations, availability?  Perhaps you could provide some color along those lines.","Hugh Grant ","I think you\u2019ve answered it, Kevin.  We took the unprecedented step of putting our estimate on acreage out there, and you know, there\u2019s still a lot of vectoring on continued drought, but some good moisture later season, but an earlier sell in.  So there\u2019s kind of multiple moving parts.  But the bottom line in this is it looks a lot of like 96 to 97 million acres, and given that 96 to 97 million acres, we\u2019ve been seeing a strong build in the order books, and a preferential pick within that order book for these technologies.  And I think that\u2019s what gives us the confidence and it backs into our production numbers.  So I think you kind of, what do they say, asked and answered?  Brett, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got anything else to say on how that\u2019s shaping up?","Brett Begemann ","I\u2019d just add two things to what Hugh said.  Number one, the Refuge in the bag convenience has really gone over great, and everything we offer in the Refuge Reducing family is Refuge in the bag now.  And that convenience factor is huge, and I would argue going to be really important this year with what could be a compressed planting season as we see the moisture across the Midwest, and not getting in the field as early as last year.  ","The other piece is that, and I highlighted it in my comments, is the outstanding performance of SmartStax last year.  And as you look across that corn belt and the challenges farmers face with insects and continue to face, SmartStax is core.  And it\u2019s now our top-selling product out of the Refuge Reducing family, going right at that root worm.  So that\u2019s helped move us in that direction as well, Kevin.  ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial ","Since this is the first time you\u2019ve had to talk to us post the Dupont settlement, I was a little surprised that maybe you didn\u2019t take the opportunity to raise your long term earnings growth estimate, because after all, as Brett points out, you\u2019ve secured a very large customer for a long period of time.  So it seems to me your long term growth rate could easily be above 15%.  How should I think about that?","Hugh Grant ","We are delighted to have the deal done.  We\u2019re pleased to welcome Dupont Pioneer as a new licensee to our soybean technologies.  And I think as you look\u2026 You know, I never talked much today about \u201914 and \u201915.  As you look into \u201914, I guess I\u2019d say it increases the certainty or improves the clarity or confidence as we look at those growth rates with Dupont incorporated in there, and some of the other growth drivers that we talked about this morning, but frankly, at this time of the year, maybe it\u2019s tradition, maybe it\u2019s common sense, but at this time of the year, we\u2019re more focused on getting seed planted, and getting the season nailed that looking further out.  ","But I take your point.  I mean, it was a sizable deal, it\u2019s significant, and it brings strength to the portfolio, and it gives clarity on longer term growth opportunities.  So I think that\u2019s a conversation that we\u2019ll have as the year pans out, rather than pre-spring, I think.  ","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial ","Just a quick follow up.  If it\u2019s a play on words, you\u2019ve talked about Monsanto being a yield company.  I\u2019m wondering if you could also apply that to the financial side, maybe.  While you talk about share repurchases today, it would seem to me, given the share price move, and given the earnings visibility, that a sizable dividend increase could also be in the cards.","Hugh Grant  ","Well, so we\u2019re blessed, and I think it\u2019s more than a play on words.  I think one begets the other, right?  So it starts with bushels, and ends with dollars, and our ability to deliver bushels with consistency in our pricing improves our [pick] with growers.  It favors our opportunity to win, you know, each spring when we sit down at that kitchen table.  As Pierre outlined in his comments, and I\u2019ll maybe ask him to say another few words, we\u2019ve looked at this from buybacks and dividends, and as our financial strength increases, we, you know, it\u2019s our share owners\u2019 money, and we will aggressively repatriate it.  But Pierre, I don\u2019t know if you want to underscore that.","Pierre Courduroux ","No, I think that\u2019s exactly right, Hugh.  Our first priority always is to be reinvesting in our business and we feel we\u2019ve done that, and we are on the verge of doing that again.  However, as I mentioned this morning, we feel extremely good about our balance sheet right now, so we\u2019re going to move towards returning more of the cash we generate toward our owners, and absolutely dividend is one of the two tools we will be using.  The way we are thinking about it is obviously on a year by year basis.  But the way we think about dividend is obviously as a long term commitment.  ","So the balance between dividend and buyback is something that we are always very careful about, and very considerate when making those types of moves.  And obviously working with our board in those types of decisions.  But what I can tell you today is that we\u2019re going to be more aggressive returning the cash we generate to our owners, because we feel very good about the position of our balance sheet.  ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Lawrence Alexander from Jefferies & Company.  Please proceed with your question.","Lawrence Alexander - Jefferies & Company","","First, did you have any kind of assumption for a settlement with Dupont in your mid-teens guidance before the announcement?  And second of all, as you look at the cadence of profit margin improvement in corn over the next few years, do you get a better pricing position with your next-generation drought products if we remain in the kind of environment we\u2019ve seen recently, or are you neutral on the environment and the climate conditions?","Hugh Grant ","I\u2019ll take the second piece.  I think we\u2019d say we\u2019re neutral.  It\u2019s nice to have that opportunity, but you can\u2019t speculate.  I\u2019d say we\u2019re neutral.  And the Dupont question, it\u2019s [unintelligible].  So some of that was baked in, because we continued to expect growth in beans, but it\u2019s nice to have, to the earlier question, the certainty around that rather than the speculation of outcomes and courts and appeals and protracted processes.  We\u2019ve all of us, over the last 10 years, tried to reach a business resolution, and I\u2019m pleased to see that we\u2019ve finally got to that.  And we\u2019ll broaden the choices for growers.  They\u2019ve now got the chance to choose brands by technology options.  And some of that\u2019s going to be, obviously, incremental growth to where we were forecasting.  But I think the way I would think about it is it\u2019s clarity, it\u2019s certainty, and it strengthens the portfolio in the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak and Company.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak & Co.","I\u2019m looking at the Intacta yield data that you provided.  Obviously you have not provided any guidance on final pricing, but maybe you can just walk us through how you\u2019re thinking through that process.  Will this be strictly pricing the new yield data on the basis of that $80\/acre value capture, or will you be looking at 2014 futures at that point and then coming up with maybe an average of the yield between the initial yield groundbreakers and then the 2012-2013 data?","Hugh Grant ","Good question.  I\u2019ll maybe let Brett say a few words.  The algebra and the trigonometry isn\u2019t that precise, because we\u2019re pricing once a year.  So in reality, we\u2019re pricing forward, and the point of being consistent, you have to kind of stake a claim and then stick with it.  I think it\u2019s going to be fast on this ramp.  There\u2019s tremendous demand, and the good news is we\u2019re reconfirming, you know there\u2019s four new bushels coming up on the farm, and that\u2019s a really big deal.  But Brett, as you talk to some of these massive growers down there, what\u2019s that price talk, and how\u2019s that philosophy playing out?","Brett Begemann ","I think it\u2019s important to go back to what has been our pricing philosophy, and we\u2019re going to stick consistent with that philosophy.  It\u2019s how much incremental value has been created, and this year confirms, again, for the second time, that it\u2019s in the range of $80, based on assumptions, of course, and that comes from improved yields, reduced insect control costs, etc.  So we\u2019ll look at that, and we\u2019ll look at that in conjunction with the offers that we have available in the marketplace.  And we\u2019ll shoot for a percentage sharing of that.  ","But at the same time, not only will we be thinking about Intacta and the sharing around Intacta, we\u2019ll be thinking about the pipeline that Rob talked about in the first quarter call, where we\u2019re going to be looking at Intacta 2 and Intacta 3 coming behind it, and how do we build a trajectory into those.  So this is about the long term approach to soybeans, and as I mentioned, soybeans becoming a significant billion dollar driver for our South America business over the next five years.  And that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about this, is in a whole strategic approach to that.  We\u2019ll be more specific with that as we get final approvals and get those conversations done with our farmer customers.","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak & Co.  ","And from a timing standpoint, how should we think about that?  Can that be finalized prior to the Chinese import approval?  Or is that potentially a gate?","Brett Begemann ","Well, we\u2019re in conversations with farmers all the time about how we\u2019re seeing the value, and they are as well.  And we\u2019ll build it into our overall process.  But what I would remind you of is, as much as I\u2019d like to have a whole bunch of Intacta to sell next year, we\u2019ll be limited biologically on how much we can produce.  So of course the Chinese approval will be a significant part of how we choose to take that new technology into the marketplace, but it won\u2019t be the driver necessarily on how we think about our pricing.  But it will be closer to planting time than where we are today.","Bryan Hurley","And operator, I recognize we\u2019re getting near the end of our call.  I think we probably have time for one final question.  Then I want to leave just a little bit of time for Hugh to wrap things up.","Operator","Certainly, sir.  Then our final question today will come from [Bill Yeoh from Kinspeak, LLC].  Please proceed with your question.  ","[Bill Yeoh - Kinspeak, LLC]","Maybe you could fill us in a little bit on your outlook for market share in soybeans here in the U.S.  I think you\u2019re at number two now, and you\u2019ve got your Roundup Ready 2 Yield, etc., Extend coming out.  What do you see this year, and what do you see going forward?","Hugh Grant ","The good news is on our forecast we\u2019re seeing, as Brett mentioned, 39-41 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Yield.  So it\u2019s only a few brief years ago there was a question on whether Roundup Ready 2 Yield would ever make it.  And it became the key technology player in soybeans, so very pleased with the progress.  39-41, who knows where the market is going to land, but nice growth.  ","And as a couple of questions have come up here with the recent deal with Dupont Pioneer, and welcoming them onto that platform, we now pretty much license the industry in the U.S., so growers are going to have their pick of brand by technology.  So nice growth.  And I\u2019m always a little bit nervous until we get that seed planted in the ground, but if you look at strength in order book, you look at our forecasts, and you look at the way the season is setting up, we\u2019re feeling pretty good with the opportunity and the growth in the segment.   ","So I\u2019ll maybe just say a few words and wrap up.  Thanks for your patience for a couple of minutes over today, but it\u2019s an important quarter.  I started by saying that the quarter of Q2 is important because of the look that it gives us, not just this year, but as a few of the questions came up, it gives us an early indicator into next year and beyond.  ","And I think I\u2019d reemphasize that notion as we close by just summarizing three points that I would take away from this unique vantage point as you look towards the remainder of this year and beyond.  First of all, we raised guidance today.  We\u2019re on track, because of that, for a third consecutive year of strong growth with our range reaching greater than 20% ongoing EPS growth, if you take the high end of that guidance range.  And I think that speaks to our momentum, our performance, and the continued improved relationship that we\u2019re seeing with our grower customers.","Secondly, as Brett mentioned in this call, we have the right drivers in place to drive our growth going forward, and that speaks to our focus on customers over the last few years, and our opportunity as a company dedicated to yield in the broadest sense of yield.  And then finally, and thirdly, our results show the power of an increasingly global business, particularly in the Americas.","So we\u2019re very focused on turning that opportunity into results, and I look forward to reporting on progress with you this year once we get the U.S. crop planted this spring.  So thanks for joining us again on the call this morning, and thanks for your continued support.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star, zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Ms. Meyer. You may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Rob, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team and Tim Boeker and Priyal Patel.","Our second quarter call provides our first view into how the northern hemisphere season is shaping up, and today we will be sharing a business and strategic overview as well as a summary of our second quarter results and a full-year outlook. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at Monsanto.com.","We have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the company\u2019s actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today\u2019s press release.","First and foremost, let me review our second quarter results on shown on Slide 4. Our second quarter ongoing earnings per share is $2.90, which is within the range we outlined at our first quarter call. Our free cash flow year-to-date is $986 million as compared to $290 million year-to-date in the prior year, reflecting the absence of the Climate acquisition and the Novozymes transaction in the current fiscal year. These results, combined with our revised outlook for the year, still give us confidence that we are within the guidance ranges outlined at the beginning of the fiscal year, namely $5.75 to $6 of ongoing earnings per share, and $2 billion to $2.2 billion of free cash flow, although now trending to the low end of each of the respective ranges as shown on Slide 5.","With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to add context to the strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. As we look across the current landscape, we clearly acknowledge the reality facing the global players in the ag industry, namely declining corn acres and rapidly weakening foreign currencies. These industry-wide economic challenges have led us to point to the lower end of our earnings per share and cash flow guidance, and yet even at the low end of our original guidance range, we still expect double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth, reaching a new record level for annual earnings per share for our business.","Two years of spectacular growing conditions have translated into the current oversupply situation for corn, and in response acres continue to decline while demand from feed accelerates to rebalance supply. In tandem, farmers have sharpened their pencils across their input costs as they in turn balance risk with returns.","Even so, our grower customers continue to ask us to innovate in agriculture. They are seeking yield and productivity tools like newer hybrids, technology traits, and digital agriculture tools, clearly reflecting that yield and productivity will differentiate them in times of compressed margins. Further, while we continue to monitor these headwinds and mitigate where feasible through the management of our expenses and a balanced product portfolio, we won\u2019t let this distract us from the business execution that\u2019s critical to our longer term growth, and it\u2019s that execution combined with our innovation which truly differentiates us.","The accomplishments in the first half of the year are a testament to that commitment to seamless execution on the variables that we control, as seen on Slide 5. INTACTA acreage now stands at 15 million acres for fiscal year 2015, and with seed production in place for targeted penetration of 30 million acres for fiscal year 2016, we\u2019re well down the path of this 100 million acre opportunity. The excitement for the expense platform is building both with growers and internally as we continue to make strong progress. Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is now sold out from our limited commercial introduction, and plans for more than a 3 million acre launch in Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in 2016 are on pace for this nearly 200 million acre opportunity.","Our footprint continues to expand in corn even with a smaller acreage base, and growers continue to embrace the latest technologies and hybrids. Our investment in climate and biologicals has ramped, and with the focus on penetration and engagement, the next generation of Climate Pro is now reaching the hands of growers as we speak. Our organization has managed spend to allow for accelerated funding of these platforms like Climate, and we now expect full-year operating expenses to be down slightly.","Finally, we continue to deploy our capital effectively and return value to our shareowners with our $6 billion accelerated share repurchase that we expect to fully close in April, a significant step in our commitment toward the net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5.","So the fundamentals of our business are unchanged, and these accomplishments are the cornerstones for our long-term growth drivers. The annual dynamics of agriculture may cause our rate of gain to be uneven at times, but it doesn\u2019t change the trajectory for growth, particularly given the backdrop of long-term demand for both corn and soybeans.","As shown on Slide 6, we continue to see annual demand for corn increasing by more than 500 million bushels per year, while soybean demand grows by more than 200 million bushels per year. Recent WASDE estimates now indicate that the global demand requirements for corn have grown by nearly 900 million bushels as compared to the prior season, and on the supply side we now estimate that at least 11 to 12 million acres of corn will have come out of production in the primary markets since 2013. The efficiency of the global corn market is undisputed, as is a growing population\u2019s demand for more protein and more grain. As always, we divert much more than the usual annual ebbs and flows of agriculture. Our focus is on the innovation that improves and protects the yield for the grower through a multitude of conditions and in an increasingly balanced portfolio. This foresight in the development and investment in soybeans has paid off, and we expect it will continue as the decade of the soybean marches forward.","Roundup Ready 2 Yield, Intacta, and Xtend remain very much on track for their expected long-term growth trends. While the former two products provide current year earnings growth, as acres rotate from corn to soybeans and beyond the fast-growing soybean growth drivers, we\u2019re anticipating the next generation of solutions across six broad technology platforms, expanding from the core seed and traits platform as shown on Slide 7. Today, we\u2019re adding to that foundation with complementary chemistries and seed treatments, biological solutions, and finally digital agriculture where the application of data science through our climate offerings can enhance each and every decision in a grower\u2019s operation.","As we look across this pipeline of new products, as well as our existing portfolio and brand franchises, we continue to attract and pursue significant licensing opportunities, and some of that could come as soon as this year. We remain strategically aligned to the long-term horizon as demonstrated by our disciplined near-term execution. Agriculture remains an excellent space for investment given the continuing long-term demand projections and our consistent delivery of innovation that so effectively aligns to those trends. Near-term conditions require measured adjustments to spending and risk management, but as shown on Slide 8, we\u2019re continuing the investments in the platforms required to delivery our long-term commitment to more than double our ongoing earnings by share by 2019.","So with that, let me hand over to Brett for the operational update that underpins these first half accomplishments and our long-term strategic outlook.","Brett Begemann","Thanks Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Despite the industry cross-current of lower global corn acres, I remain extremely confident in the foundation of our global corn business and the long-term mechanisms for growth. As I\u2019ve said before, our corn yield performance has never been better. Our multi-pronged go-to-market strategy continues to serve us and our customers well, and the proof points are in the results we see in this quarter and in the outlook for the rest of the year.","Let\u2019s take a look at the specifics, as shown on Slide 9. At the halfway point in our fiscal year, we have now wrapped up our first season in Brazil and capped it with more than two share points of growth in our branded market share in the summer season that we now believe contracted closer to 13%. We also had a small but meaningful launch of our first triple-stack product in corn, continued upgrades to our second and third generation traits, and nice price mix lift in our germplasm, excluding currency effects. Looking forward, the Brazil safrinha season is underway and we expect flat corn acres and similar trends in our performance from the first season in Brazil. In Argentina, triples continued to be the product of choice, and we held our strong share position on an acreage base that was 16% smaller than last year.","Within the U.S. corn seed business, as we\u2019ve been indicating, our results year-to-date reflect the timing shift of our channel brand businesses from second quarter to third quarter. We are encouraged by the change we\u2019ve made in this business, and we still expect roughly $275 million of gross profit, mostly in corn, to move between quarters based on our view into our order books. Beyond this timing shift, the reduced refuge family of products is maintaining its percentage of the portfolio from the prior year. We continue to see conversion to our dual mode of action products like SmartStax and Double PRO, as well as improved uptake of our DroughtGard hybrids, although on a corn acreage base we now see trending closer to 87 to 88 million acres. Demand for the combination of one year and Year 2 DeKalb hybrids is expected to be approximately 40% of the total portfolio, with particularly strong interest in the more familiar high performing Year 2 products.","In the spirit of dollar cost averaging and due to the consistent exceptional performance in some of our proven hybrids, as depicted on Slide 10, we did see some higher than normal demand for this generation at the expense of the midpoint of the portfolio. While this is expected to migrate the germplasm price mix lift to the low single digits this year, the general portfolio mix curve is intact and demonstrates that even in this environment, growers are demanding the newest hybrids, giving us confidence in the long-term outlook for this business.","Across Europe and South Africa, we expect to hold or grow share in a region of declining corn acres, and when setting aside the punishing currency effects and despite the challenging competitive dynamics, it appears that our germplasm price mix lift will be positive across the region for the year.","In Asia, we continue to see adoption in traits in the Philippines, and we recently received approvals for our first biotech traits in corn in Vietnam, allowing us to move forward with pre-commercial trials. Like much of the rest of the world, we expect to grow share and have positive lift in our germplasm price mix, exclusive of parity, as we look across all of Asia.","Overall, we remain on track to hold or grow our branded share footprint in every major market in the face of declining corn acres, and exclusive of currency headwinds we expect to deliver positive germplasm price mix lift for the full year. This is an outstanding achievement in the time of compressed margins for our grower customers, reflecting their continued demand for high performing seed technology.","Even more compelling is the outstanding performance we continue to see in our soybean business, which is proving critical in this challenging environment. The power of a balanced portfolio is evident as our soybean business continues the momentum that has carried from a record fiscal year \u201914 and excellent first quarter. Across South America, as seen on Slide 11, our value proposition to Intacta delivered and we reached a record 15 million acres in our second year of launch, a five-fold increase over the first year. As we review the seed production plans across the multipliers and the licensees for the next season, we now believe we will have Intacta available in 150 varieties for Brazil alone. This addition of 50 new varieties in Brazil will be enough to fully serve all maturity zones for the third year of commercialization. Overall, we now expect to penetrate an estimated 30 million acres with Intacta in South America in fiscal year \u201916, a meaningful tipping point in the 100 million acre opportunity for Intacta.","Backing up these plans is yet another year of strong product performance. As shown on Slide 12, our early yield results reveal that we once again delivered more than a four bushel average yield advantage with Intacta soybeans over comparisons of Roundup Ready soybeans managed by insecticides. In addition, we continued to see a reduction in insecticide sprays and insect damage with the use of Intacta soybeans, clearly visible in the photo from this year\u2019s production.","As we continue to plan for the expansion of our Intacta business in South America, we have also advanced our negotiations with the grain traders and elevators and have now secured more than 90% of the origination points across Brazil to allow for a very robust point of delivery payment system. Approximately 95% of the Intacta soybeans planet were paid for up front this season in Brazil, and we expect a similar pattern of certified seed sales for next year. Nonetheless, securing options to pay at the end of the season with the delivery at the elevator provides our growers with the choices they value.","In Argentina, not only are we seeing Intacta penetration for the first time, but the point of delivery system implementation is off to a good start in its inaugural season. We have now secured agreements with more than 95% of the origination points in the north and more than 70% of the growers paid for their seed purchases in advance, again providing growers with choice in how they secure this game-changing technology.","In the U.S., the combination of shipments and our order book leads us to conclude that soybean acres and our share are both growing, with farmers continuing to choose Roundup Ready 2 Yield as the product of choice across both our branded and our licensed footprint. Preparations for a record trade launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans continued as we await final regulatory approvals and secure seed production acres for what we expect to be a greater than 3 million acre launch in 2016 and available in more than 60 varieties, as shown on Slide 13. We see strong alignment from our licensees in the plans for launch and our remaining regulatory approvals are proceeding. We have submitted all the required data to the China Ministry of Ag, and they have all necessary information required to grant an approval. Again, we are maintaining our focus on execution for this next wave of growth in our soybean business, one whose acre opportunity is almost double that of Intacta as the need for flexible, exceptional weed control reaches across the Americas.","Cotton is also notable this quarter because we are sold out for the limited commercial introduction of Bollgard II XtendFlex on more than 500,000 acres, as shown on Slide 14. We announced our pricing of $6 an acre for the added value from flexible, improved weed control along with a full XtendFlex chemistry rebate to reflect that growers are unable to use dicamba over the top as we await final regulatory approvals. Interest in the technology has been tremendous, as demonstrated by the sold out position. Altogether, more than 1,600 growers and stakeholders have attended grower education sessions across the south since 1 January. This limited introduction is allowing our grower customers to experience the improved performance of new Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton varieties, as well as the benefits of two of the three herbicide tolerances that are currently available for use with this product, namely glyphosate and glufosinate tolerance. Based on a look into our order books, we expect these new varieties to drive back-to-back share growth in the delta pine brand in the U.S.","We have also rolled out our Climate Pro offering for this season, featuring the newly improved nitrogen and field health advisors, and we recently enhanced our introductory pricing of $3 per acre through marketing programs that are driving penetration and engagement with the technology. At a time when a grower\u2019s attention to every line of their P&L is heightened, the meter by meter optimization our precision tools have to offer becomes even more beneficial. The application of data science to our extensive field trial and genetics data through the development and application of software has the potential to create unprecedented value for growers.","To facilitate this roll-out, we have already trained more than 1,000 selling agents across our broad retail partnership, touching virtually every corn and soybean acre in the U.S. While it is too early to estimate the acres for Climate Basic or Climate Pro for this season, we remain committed to our targets to increase our active Basic users by 50% from our fiscal year \u201914 base of 30 million acres, and to more than double our 1 million premium acres from fiscal year \u201914, as shown on Slide 15.","In our ag productivity business, we are in the midst of the largest quarter in the year in the northern hemisphere as we provide customers with our branded products for their critical over-the-top sprays in their Roundup Ready crops. As we guided, our volumes continued to shift through the second half of the year, closer to these key application windows as a greater portion of our business is sold as branded volume this year. This shift in volumes to the latter half of the year also explains the majority of the decline in the business year to date. In addition, we\u2019re seeing some of the anticipated softening in price at the retail level and have followed suit with low to mid-single digit price adjustments to maintain a small premium over the generics, consistent with our strategy.","I remain very optimistic about the business and our outlook. Our accomplishments year-to-date are impressive with 15 million acres of Intacta penetration, Climate product introductions, Xtend launch plans, and early share growth and price mix lift in corn, despite substantial currency and core acreage headwinds. Further, we will continue to leverage the benefit to the balanced portfolio as the decade of the soybean continues with expected Roundup Ready 2 Yield acreage expansion, expected branded seed share growth and production plans to potentially supply 30 million acres of Intacta in South America and a greater than 3 million acre launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in \u201916.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it to Pierre for the financial update.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks Brett, and good morning to everyone. As we sit at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we can now reflect upon the accomplishments of the first half while refining our strategy and outlook for the rest of the year. Intacta has been a tremendous success in its second year of commercialization. Our core share footprint has grown in the southern hemisphere this season, and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans continue to meet the milestones necessary to propel it forward for what is now expected to be a more than 3 million acre launch in 2016. We have responded to the weakening of foreign currencies and declining corn acres, and we have reduced operating spend while still funding our newest platforms, namely Climate and biologicals, at a pace far ahead of last year. Finally, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy with the expected full closure of our $6 billion accelerated share repurchase in April.","Altogether, we continue to deliver on the key drivers of our long-term growth plans, remaining acutely focused on the variables we control and true to our strategy of innovation through a balanced portfolio. There is no doubt, however, that the further weakening of foreign currencies has led to what now appears to be a $0.35 to $0.40 headwind for this fiscal year, primarily concentrated in corn gross profit and to a lesser degree in our ag productivity gross profit, and driven by the deterioration of several key currencies versus a dollar very close to today\u2019s rate.","These currency headwinds, coupled with a more certain decline in corn acres and some moderation of corn germplasm mix lift, now means that we are trending to the low end of our original guidance range of $5.75 to $6 of earnings per share, as well as to the lower end of our free cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, as shown on Slide 16 and 17. Within that guidance, we now expect that our seeds and genomics gross profit growth will migrate to low to mid-single digits, with the expected growth in soybean gross profit more than offsetting the anticipated slight decline in corn gross profit resulting from the currency and acreage headwinds. Ag productivity gross profit is expected to decline approximately 10% versus prior year due to anticipated [indiscernible] price softening and an incremental 2 to 3% due to deteriorating currencies.","Total operating expenses, including our new platforms, are now expected to be down in the range of 3 to 5% versus the prior year as we further tighten our spending in light of the current trend, and as we benefit from the expected weaker foreign currencies in our operating expenses. Interest expenses remain consistent with prior expectations, reflecting the additional debt and our progress toward our stated goal of a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5. Other expenses are expected to be roughly a third of the prior year as we are anticipating less of a devaluation of the Argentine peso in fiscal \u201915. Meanwhile, the tax rate has migrated to the low end of our original guidance of 28 to 30% through continued expected discrete tax benefits.","When converting this full-year guidance into a quarterly look, we expect around 80 to 85% of the remaining earnings per share to fall into the third quarter, with the residual in the fourth quarter. In Q3, we expect a shift of roughly $275 million of gross profit in the [indiscernible] business to benefit our results, and in the fourth quarter we expect a strong start to our South American business, more normalized corn returns in the U.S., continued momentum in soybeans, and a very disciplined management of our operating expenses to drive growth.","If we take a deeper dive into the margins and the outlook for the year, the success of our Intacta franchise and continued demand for Roundup Ready 2 Yield is clearly reflected in the nearly four point improvement in soybean margins year-to-date, and while we expect that to moderate some, we do expect positive margin lift in soybeans for the full year. For corn, the margins are down roughly two points year-to-date as a result of the shift in the higher margin channel business to Q3, with continued year-over-year decline in the trait pricing for Brazil and the higher than expected cost of goods sold in South America. We continue to convert the Brazil corn seed business to higher cost, single-cross trait hybrids, and while this has widened our performance advantage and enables share growth, it does increase our cost of goods. This combined with the flooding in Argentina during the last production season has elevated our COGS in corn year-to-date. By the end of the year, we do expect corn gross profit margins to be relatively flat to the prior year as South America becomes a smaller component of the total mix of our corn business for the full year. Altogether when looking at the seed and genomics segment as a whole, we expect roughly 1% margin improvement for the full year, reflecting the benefits of a broadening soybean portfolio.","The last thing I would like to share with you today is our outlook on free cash flow. We are now tracking to the lower end of our original free cash guidance of $2 billion to $2.2 billion as we now estimate that cash flows from operations will be $3 billion to $3.3 billion with cash flows from investing activities to be a use of cash of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. The decline in our operating cash flow projections is twofold. Our projected net income is tracking lower for the reasons we mentioned earlier, primarily currency and acreage related; and our inventories have increased as corn acres have retreated more than we originally planned, and corn seed production yields were higher than expected.","Looking ahead to fiscal year \u201916, this continued decline in corn acres and strong production yields from last season, as seen across the industry, is translating to a reduced corn seed production plan which we are just finalizing for the [indiscernible] this year. Our current inventories are in excellent condition and will carry to the next season, topped off by the smaller production plan from this summer. While this is the optimal choice from a cash and inventory management perspective, this will result in higher cost of goods for fiscal year \u201916, after which we expect to see some normalization in the size of our production plan and the benefit of lower hedged commodity prices. In response to this expected reduction in cash flows from operations, we are being more diligent in the management of our investing cash flows, allowing us to deliver an expected free cash flow of at least $2 billion.","With this continued excellent conversion of our earnings into cash, we remain committed to returning value to our owners through our capital allocation strategy. I\u2019m pleased to announce that half of our $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan has officially closed, resulting in the delivery of an additional 6.6 million shares. We expect the remaining $3 billion of the ASR to close in April will similar results.","Following the close of our third quarter, we plan to evaluate our next steps in advancing to a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 after the full closure of our $6 billion accelerated share repurchase and after we have a clear line of sight on our short and midterm cash needs at the end of our two most significant quarters.","Similar to the industry, we are seeing significant currency and acreage headwinds in fiscal year \u201915, but we also see the confirmation of the long-term growth drivers that support our gross profit expansion through a global balanced portfolio, while still delivering on the new record for earnings per share this year. When combined with our disciplined balanced approach to funding our growth platforms and our continued commitment to effective capital allocation, I am confident we are on track in the first year of our five-year plan to more than double ongoing earnings per share.","Thanks, and I will turn it back to Laura for the Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks Pierre. With that, we\u2019d now like to open the call for questions. As we typically do, I\u2019ll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You are always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up.","Rob, I think we\u2019re ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","The first question today is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna International. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. A question, Pierre, on the foreign currency impact. Are you saying that without the incremental $0.15, $0.20 of foreign currency pressure, that basically your guidance would be unchanged? And then a specific impact on corn, is the slight reduction in corn gross profit due primarily to foreign exchange, or what are the other drivers in terms of price, volume, and cost of goods sold?","Pierre Courduroux","So Don, to your first question, the way you look at it is definitely a way to think about it actually, because we point now to the low end of our guidance and the guidance range was about $0.25; so yes, I would agree with you on this one.","Regarding the second question regarding corn gross profit, so the way we think about it actually is when you look at the first half, more than $200 million of the difference we see versus last year is related to the shift of our channel business from Q2 to Q3, and the rest of the difference is basically split, two-thirds related to currency and acreage headwinds, so about two-thirds of the remaining difference, and one-third is related to the trait pricing and COGS in South America that we referred to in the prepared remarks. Looking into the full year, we expect the impact of acres and currency to be more than $300 million - this is how we think about it right now; however, we expect also to see the combined benefits of germplasm price lift and the share gains we are anticipating, resulting in more than $200 million of benefit. So that is the way we are thinking about the corn gross profit going forward.","The difference we may see at the end of the day will be the balance between the soybeans, which today we anticipate to be more than offsetting this decline in corn, and it\u2019s going to be the difference in between the soybeans and the corn that\u2019s going to make the final number.","Don Carson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks, and good morning everyone. Question on--you know, obviously Intacta is going to be big in the fourth quarter. The Brazilian real has had a big move, and who knows whether it\u2019s done or not; but could you talk a little bit about what your opportunity is to address the pricing of that product, both in the near, medium and long term as it relates to the real?","Hugh Grant","Yes Vincent, thanks for your question. We are delighted with performance in the ramp, and yield is now--references to a slight yield is now coming in an early lead with 12, 13% of harvesters were beating that four bushel goal. So still rolling up price, Brett, but what was the early read on price?","Brett Begemann","Yes, good morning, Vincent. The way we\u2019re looking at it now is let\u2019s keep in mind strategically what our intent has been with Intacta from the get-go, and that\u2019s been to introduce it into the marketplace in a very aggressive fashion, going from 15 million acres headed to 30 million acres for next year, which means that we\u2019re expecting a very aggressive ramp-up. As we look at pricing, as Hugh mentioned, we\u2019ve had another spectacular performance year with Intacta. We\u2019re highly confident in the performance going forward, and as we look to the future, we will be taking that into consideration with pricing. I would say at this point in time, we\u2019re leaning in to looking upwards on the price curve.","The thing that I would remind you is soybeans. We keep talking about the decade of the soybeans, and we\u2019ve got an incredible next-generation Intacta already coming, so as we think about this over the longer term, Vincent, we\u2019re thinking about moving Intacta very aggressively into the marketplace, building out that position, and as we bring up the price on Intacta, we\u2019ll be thinking about the next generation to move that market as well.","Hugh Grant","Vincent, I\u2019d just add one thing. We see phenomenal growth opportunities. We\u2019re on the ground floor of that growth. As we think about price and that, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll fully offset the real devaluation, but we will be very, very careful not to stall the growth opportunity by reaching for that incremental real. This is much more about velocity and really growing that platform as fast as we possibly can.","Vincent Andrews","Understood, appreciate it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. I think your corn revenues were down 14% in the first half. Can you analyze that for us?","Pierre Courduroux","So as I mentioned, and I was referring to the gross profit impact in the first half of the year, a big part of that is just the pure timing related to the move of our channel business, so for $200 million of gross profit, if you give and take 60%-plus margin, you can get the impact on sales; I don\u2019t have the number in front of me. The rest of the difference, similarly - and upgraded for the guidance for the margin - two-thirds of the difference related to currency, and this one definitely hitting us pretty hard, and the acreage headwinds, so two-thirds of the remaining difference, and the last third is the trait pricing, which definitely on the sales line also has an impact when you look at Brazil specifically. And this one, as you know, we talked about that during the first quarter was related to the price adjustment in the market related to some of our competitors\u2019 issues with resistance there in Brazil.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, thank you very much.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Question related to U.S. corn seed. I think you had mentioned a slight mix shift from Year 1 to Year 2 hybrids. I was wondering if you\u2019ve observed that sort of a shift in years past throughout your experience, and whether you could comment on what is driving it. In other words, it would seem economically rational if the yield is there and the value is being shared with the customer. Thanks.","Hugh Grant","Yes Kevin, we\u2019ve probably seen more of it this year than we\u2019ve seen in a long time, and I think it\u2019s a function of the euphemism of growers sharpening their pencils, number one; and number two, we have some really great products in that category and growers had fantastic experience with them last year and reached back for them. So it\u2019s the curse of having really great performing hybrids.","I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything to that, Brett?","Brett Begemann","No, I think you\u2019ve covered it very well. I think, Kevin, if you look at our Year 1 and 2 products, we\u2019re at about 40%, and plus-minus that\u2019s a reasonable number to think of. Essentially every year, that\u2019s been our experience, is around that 40%. This year we got a little bit more of Year 2 than we have in Year 1, and here\u2019s my take-away from it, is farmers are clearly voting for our newest hybrids, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so confident in the strategy for pricing our germplasm, is they are voting for the best. What they\u2019re doing with their sharp pencil is saying, well, maybe 2 versus 1, but they\u2019re not going backwards down the portfolio and that\u2019s why the pricing curve is still intact.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you very much.","Hugh Grant","I think just to add to Kevin\u2019s question, I think this year, if you can climb above the headwinds and get above the noise and look at the business, I think this last question really illustrates that even in tough times, we see growers reaching for innovation and reaching for the really great performing hybrids. So in a tough ag environment, we feel really good that the model is still alive and well, and that growers are selecting the best possible hybrids out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Koort","Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk on Xtend a bit. I think maybe your competitor in that arena suggested a retail price of $12 an acre. Is that sort of order of magnitude of what you think the retail capture might be for Xtend, and do you have any regulatory hurdles to sell that product and get it qualified in South America? I know you mentioned China in terms of approving it, but what about for use in South America?","Hugh Grant","Yes, so Bob, thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll let Brett say a few words. The competitor pricing is news - I haven\u2019t heard that. I mean, we\u2019re focused on our own franchise. Here\u2019s what I can tell you, and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, tremendous interest and enormous amount of pent-up demand. I wish we had it today, but tremendous grower interest, and I think we\u2019re going to be so much smarter with what Brett said, the in excess of half a million acres that are already committed. This thing sold out faster than a Rolling Stone comeback concert, so we will see this fly off the shelves.","Brett, a word on that regulatory timetable and maybe how Latin America looks?","Brett Begemann","Yes, thanks Hugh. Good morning, Bob. I think the excitement around Xtend is as much or more than I\u2019ve seen around any biotech launch we\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019ve been around for all of them. It\u2019s really a compelling vote of confidence by our growers, and it also is the expression of a huge need, and that\u2019s demonstrated by how quickly we sold out of the XtendFlex varieties that we have available for delta pine this year in the south. On Xtend soybeans, we\u2019re going to be ramping aggressively for an over 3 million acre launch next year, which I\u2019m highly confident will be in high demand by customers. We\u2019ll take full advantage of this year to do testing again, to look at the product and get farmer feedback as we\u2019ve done with our new products before we get to final pricing.","I would point you to we did price the XtendFlex cotton in the south at $6, but we also extended a rebate to farmers because they won\u2019t have the opportunity to use dicamba this year, but they will get the opportunity to use two herbicide modes of action with glufosinate.","In South America, let me split South America into Argentina and Brazil. In Argentina, dicamba has had a registration in the past. We\u2019ll be moving very quickly there. They have similar challenges to what you see in North America, and dicamba with Xtend will have a nice fit. I would expect that we will lag where we\u2019re at in the U.S., but we will be moving very quickly down there. In Brazil, we have more work to do with our partners there to get the original dicamba product approved in Brazil, and then we\u2019ll move into the over-the-top with the Xtend. So Brazil will be lagging by a margin compared to Argentina, and Argentina will be right behind the U.S.","As far as the regulatory, we\u2019re on path. We\u2019re on track with the regulatory.","Bob Koort","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect, thank you. Despite some volume headwinds, I guess, in the U.S. since 2012, you\u2019ve been gaining some solid corn share across South America and Europe, particularly in eastern Europe. How much farther can this go, and do you feel it\u2019s getting more difficult to gain share in a lower soft commodity environment? Then also just kind of on the peripheral, how do you feel about South Africa and Southeast Asia as another pillar, or in aggregate is it too small to move the needle? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Yes Chris, thanks for the two questions. I think we referenced, or I made comment to the model, our premise on how we deliver and share value with growers, and it\u2019s hard to say in a tough [indiscernible], but I\u2019m heartened to see that even in these tough times, that model is intact. As the dust settles, I think as we look around, we\u2019re probably seeing that we held or grew share in every one of our major markets worldwide. It\u2019s never easy and every year is a new year, and every year the grower decides fresh; but I\u2019m heartened by the results and the fact that they continue to reach for innovation, even in a $4 corn environment.","Then your other question was Southeast Asia and South Africa, and Brett, I don\u2019t think these are--we don\u2019t consider them small markets, right?","Brett Begemann","No, I think we have to be careful calling them small markets, because there\u2019s a lot of corn in South Africa as well as in Asia. Here\u2019s how I think about it, is a million acres of corn is a million acres of corn. It doesn\u2019t matter what country it\u2019s grown in. We\u2019ve done extremely well in South Africa. We continue to do really well with those products. I have to tell you, I\u2019m getting more excited about Southeast Asia. We got the approval for our biotech products in Vietnam in corn most recently. We\u2019ll get to get those in the field with farmers. We\u2019re hearing really good conversations from some of the other countries in Southeast Asia. We\u2019ve been in the Philippines for a number of years and gone very well there, so there is a real opportunity there to expand the biotech opportunity in Southeast Asia, and that could carry over to India, which is another large corn market. So it\u2019s a good opportunity across the corn, even in some of these smaller countries.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect. Just a quick follow-up - regarding Intacta, can you just comment a little more on what you\u2019re hearing from existing growers and then potential new growers, given the addition of 50-plus varieties year-on-year? So in other words, what part of that incremental 15 million acres next year, that 30 versus the 15, will be contingent on new varieties versus older varieties, and is there any supply impediment there based on the new varieties? Then also, you mentioned the yield benefit, but what are you hearing from the customers regarding the cost savings angle going forward?","Brett Begemann","Well as I said, I\u2019m real excited about the Intacta performance. It\u2019s really knocked it out of the park when you have two years back-to-back of four bushel yield advantage and you see the kind of insect performance we\u2019re getting out of the product. So specific to your question, I don\u2019t believe that we will be supply constrained in the core markets of Brazil, where we\u2019ve had products in the market for a couple years. The new varieties really expand the footprint across Brazil to where now we will have varieties available in virtually every growing zone of Brazil. We were getting close last year; now we\u2019re there. So we have the real opportunity, and doubling when you have a small acreage is one thing, but doubling when you have 15 million acres and saying we\u2019re going to 30, what we\u2019re hearing from growers that are already using Intacta is they\u2019re going to use a lot more. What we\u2019re hearing from those that haven\u2019t used a lot is they\u2019re hearing from their neighbors and what they\u2019ve seen, and they\u2019re going to use a lot more. So I expect a robust expansion of that business next year.","Hugh Grant","This is the transition from the what-if to the what-is, so the performance is concrete and demonstrable, and the coffee shops are helping in the sales conversation now.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, hi. Good morning. I had a question about cadence of earnings. Now you are saying that third quarter EPS will be 80 to 85% of the second half, so fourth quarter is 15 to 20% of second half. That seems much larger than what you previously expected. I think in January you said fourth quarter would be breakeven to slightly positive. So I guess my question is are we seeing earnings shift from 2Q into 3Q, and then from 3Q into 4Q?","Pierre Courduroux","So PJ, thanks for the question. What we\u2019re assuming and the way we are thinking about the fourth quarter right now is we are assuming that the timing of the deliveries in the U.S. will allow for lower returns, so whatever moves from Q3 to Q4, depending on the returns, we are assuming there will be more in Q3 this year. Last year, as you remember, we had unusually high returns in Q4, and we are not expecting that. I mean, we could plan one way or the other, but at this point in time we are planning for lesser returns and potentially lesser sales in Q3 to add up to those returns, so that\u2019s a big variable there in the equation.","The second variable is we are expecting a strong start in South America based on what we are seeing right now in Safrinha. I mean, the dynamics in South America are turning towards corn a little more favorable, and we are expecting a strong start of the season in South America, so that would be nice upside versus last year where you remember, this was the beginning of the decline. So right now, we are expecting a level of rebound in South America in the quarter, obviously continued very strong performance of soybeans--I mean, as Brett was saying when we were talking about Intacta, we talked about the U.S. as well, so strong soybeans.","The last point I want to make is obviously, and we talked about that in the prepared remarks, is also Q4 is our largest opportunity for spend management, and that\u2019s where we spend our discretionary dollars. Most of our discretionary dollars are spent in the fourth quarter, and the reduction in spend we\u2019re looking at right now, a big part of that will happen in Q4. So for all those reasons, that\u2019s why we have--and we\u2019ve ranged it, obviously. We have not given precise guidance for the quarters, but that\u2019s the way we are thinking about the quarters and the timing and the cadence of the earnings to come.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you. On your price point, you expect lower returns this year. Why is that? Thank you.","Pierre Courduroux","Well, we expect lower returns because actually right now--I mean, the mood in the market has been fairly [indiscernible], so we think that retail and the farmers have not overcommitted onto the volumes of corn. Remember last year at this time, people were way more bullish than they are right now, so that\u2019s why--and if returns are going to be higher, we should be enjoying more sales as well in the third quarter, so this is a correction variable in our planning based on our acres. That\u2019s the way we\u2019ve been thinking about it.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. There\u2019s been some negative news on Roundup the last few weeks. Given that, how do you assess the overall risk to the portfolio and to earnings from Roundup, given what\u2019s happened and going forward?","Hugh Grant","Yes David, thank you. So I don\u2019t see any impact in the business. We continue to support the platform. There\u2019s strong demand out there, and I think it\u2019s unfortunate that junk science and this kind of mischief creates so much confusion for consumers. We continue to grow--growers are looking for safe, effective solutions, and I think Roundup and the combination of Roundup and the upcoming dicamba work that we\u2019re doing, this is going to be a blockbuster product and it\u2019s going to be huge.","So we continue to be committed, and the product is now close to 40 years old. It\u2019s been in almost constant regulatory review for that time and it\u2019s had a spotless bill of health through that entire four decades, David, so unfortunate noise presents a distraction more than a reality.","David Begleiter","Why do you think it happened now or came back to life at this time?","Hugh Grant","I\u2019m sorry - say that again?","David Begleiter","Why do you think the news came, or WHO--the World Health Organization re-looked at this issue now, as opposed to prior periods?","Hugh Grant","I\u2019m not going to speculate on that. Here\u2019s how I would look at it. Germany was the last major regulatory body that took a look at glyphosate. I always say this is like painting the Golden Gate Bridge - you know, by the time you finish, you start again. Germany took four years - they were the rapporter country for the European Union. They took four years to study the safety of the product and give it once again an impeccable opinion. The IARC team took a week, and during that week they reviewed a handful of products and reached their conclusion. So I said at the time that there\u2019s a cherrypicking element on you pick and choose what you look for, that the German reviews, the U.S. reviews - we\u2019re not starting in Canada and the U.S. again. When you use substantive science and you use state-of-the-art analytical techniques, I feel very, very confident about the strength of the product.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Connelly","Thanks. Hugh, so farmers didn\u2019t really trade down, and U.S. corn acres weren\u2019t down all that much either, so two big worries didn\u2019t come to pass. But there were some state-to-state changes, and as you think about those shifts, is that going to meaningfully affect your ability to penetrate markets like doubles, where you\u2019ve historically been lighter? Related to that, as marginal acres do come out, is it safe to assume that your share in those markets tends to be lower anyway?","Hugh Grant","Yes, that\u2019s a great question, and you do see the play out on the mosaic between that. I think one of the general trends this year we\u2019ve seen in some of these marginal acres is growers looking for a bit more value. We talked earlier about people holding on to some of those high performing hybrids for one more year, so we\u2019ve seen that and it plays out in your observation on a bit more in doubles.","But Brett, we\u2019ve kind of been tailoring the portfolio to some of that.","Brett Begemann","That\u2019s exactly right. If you think about the Double Pro product, that\u2019s the fit that it has in the marketplace. If you\u2019re a farmer in a root worm area, you\u2019re focused on root worm products and SmartStax, and that\u2019s why we see strength in SmartStax this year. If you\u2019re on the fringe, you\u2019re the one taking a look at this, saying hey, what\u2019s my opportunity, and as we said, a few people did make a trade there but it was small.","Specific to your question on the puts and takes across the states, we\u2019ve planted very low corn so far and what happens between now and the middle of the summer is Mother Nature will have a whole lot to do with which states are up and down. There\u2019s intentions right now, but the weather will have a big play into where we end up, and I\u2019m still confident at this point in time those will all wash out. We\u2019ll be in a good position by the time we get to end of year. It won\u2019t change our outcomes.","Mark Connelly","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Piken","Yes, hi. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to check in in terms of where you guys are in terms of getting Chinese approval for Xtend, and how important is that in terms of a commercial launch here in the U.S.?","Hugh Grant","Yes, as we mentioned earlier, so we\u2019ve got all the files in, we\u2019ve done all the submissions. The Chinese authorities, in our opinion, now have the dossiers that they need to make their decision, and it is important, so we need that Chinese approval. But if you look back over the years, China has been consistent. They\u2019re usually the last approval, but they\u2019ve been consistent in their processes, so we have no reason--at this stage, we\u2019ve no reason to doubt that history will repeat itself again.","Michael Piken","Okay, terrific. Then just shifting down to South America, with respect to the usage of Intacta, I know obviously you guys are working to get Xtend approved down there, but would you be amenable to selling Intacta and have it be used with a competitor\u2019s other herbicide type product, or is it going to be basically used exclusively with Xtend, or has that decision been made yet? Thanks.","Hugh Grant","It\u2019d be ultimately used with other products, but the main focus for us has been getting the regulatory approvals, getting the field trials, getting the grower experience. That\u2019s still--that\u2019s beyond the curve in the road at the moment. We just need to get the product in the hands of growers.","Michael Piken","Okay, terrific. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Joel Jackson","Hi, thanks. Good morning. The first question is going back to Intacta - you talked about 30 million acres. Can we talk about are there production constraints? What could the range be if the demand proves better, and maybe you could break down into how much of that would come from Argentina.","Hugh Grant","I guess we\u2019re beyond the production constraint stage now in terms of size of markets, and more importantly the range of varieties. So that won\u2019t be the constraint going forward, and I think it goes to my earlier point on velocity and growing that pie, so we\u2019ll be realistic in our pricing to try and drive penetration as quickly as we can.","Brett, anything else on--?","Brett Begemann","So the 30 million that we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s early. We\u2019re still counting how much seed is coming in from harvest, and we won\u2019t know that because we [indiscernible] multipliers and seed producers. But we feel good about the 30, and I\u2019d just point to that\u2019s for the whole South America market, and we\u2019re further along in Brazil than we are in Argentina, so as that mix comes to light, we\u2019ll share that as we go forward.","Joel Jackson","Okay, and finally if you look at the operational spend coming down a little bit more than you thought, can you talk about where we would see most of the cost coming down and any programs that end up getting delayed?","Pierre Courduroux","So as I mentioned, the fourth quarter is where we have most of our discretionary spend, and it\u2019s going to be coming mostly--I mean, on top of what we\u2019ve already done, a large part is going to be coming from that discretionary spend, and it\u2019s going to be the key driver. In addition to that, since we point to the low end of our guidance and compared to last year we may see lesser accruals regarding our incentives, and obviously--I mean, it\u2019s a downside for the full year but we also have a positive impact from the currency. So it\u2019s a downside for our whole business, but when you look at operating spend, this is a tailwind, I would say, just for that very specific line of the P&L.","So these are--discretionary spend is the bigger one, currency, and then potential some adjustments on our accruals.","Laura Meyer","Rob, I think we\u2019re close to time - we\u2019re actually a little bit past time, so from a Q&A, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today with their questions and pass it over to Hugh for some concluding comments.","Hugh Grant","Thanks Laura, and apologies to those on the line for running a little bit late. I hope you feel the second quarter gave you a clearer view into our 2015 opportunity. With the continued strength in our soybean business, and we were very pleased with the performance, and despite the sizeable currency and corn acreage headwinds, we still expect this year to deliver double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth and more than $2 billion of free cash flow for this fiscal year. I think more importantly, that reinforces the confidence that we have in our five-year plan to at least double our ongoing earnings per share as we delivered on several key milestones, including a record second-year ramp with Intacta and continued progress towards our capital allocation commitments.","So as I shared at the start of the call today, the fundamentals of our business are unchanged, and these accomplishments are the cornerstones for our long-term growth drivers. Cyclicality in agriculture may cause our rate of gain to be uneven at times, but it doesn\u2019t change the trajectory for growth, particularly given the continued growth of long-term global demand for both corn and soybeans.","So with that, I\u2019d like to thank you for your interest in Monsanto and for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Ms. Meyer. You may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thanks, Christine and good morning to everyone. I am joined this morning by Hugh Grant, Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, President and Chief Operating Officer; Pierre Courduroux, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Robb Fraley, our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me from the Investor Relations team are Priyal Patel and Ben Kampelman.","Today, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline update on this call as led by Dr. Fraley as well as an overview of our first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.","We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company\u2019s actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-K and in today\u2019s press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","First, let me review our first quarter results as shown on Slide 4. As shown in our reconciliations, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $0.07 in the first quarter, which included $0.19 of pending Bayer-related transaction costs. On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $0.21 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year ongoing loss of $0.11, driven by the expected strong start to our business in South America and improved currency.","With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Laura and good morning to everybody on the line. As we move in the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on two things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely with Bayer on the necessary steps to close the deal which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017.","Let\u2019s begin with an update on the deal as shown on Slide 5. First, we are pleased to see the strong share on our support for the proposal to combine with Bayer with approximately 99% of the votes cast in support of the combination. With the vote behind us, our team is working with Bayer on the required regulatory filings and continued key stakeholder outreach. The Hart-Scott-Rodino filings have been made in the U.S. along with several filings and other jurisdictions and we anticipate submission of the required filing in the EU in the first calendar quarter of this year.","We continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2017 and our confidence stems from the findings that these are two different, but highly complementary businesses with limited overlap. If those overlaps do exist, however, Bayer anticipates and is committed to undertake a certain level of divestitures as required by the regulatory agencies. Also both Robb and I have been personally involved in extensive grower outreach as well as discussions with key policymakers and politicians sharing our views on the innovation enhancements that we envision from this combination. Innovation is the foundation of the industrial logic for the combination with Bayer just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry back in the late \u201890s. An innovation creates jobs and it creates opportunities for both consumers and for our growers. This deal takes what we have been doing for the last 15 years to a whole new level with St. Louis as the heartland for seeds and biotech research for the new company worldwide. 15 years ago, we were spending roughly $550 million a year in R&D. This year, we will spend approximately $1.5 billion in R&D and we look forward to the combined levels of R&D that we anticipate investing in innovation for growers through the combination with Bayer.","Growers seek this innovation opportunity, because they recognize that resources are finite. Demand is real and productivity improvement is the key to their success. The USDA demand figures have indicated that over the past four seasons, world demand for corn grew by over 4 billion bushels while soy demand in the same timeframe grew by over 2 billion bushels. The December WASDE Report indicated continued strength with corn demand for the current marketing year growing by over 1.4 billion bushels and soy demand growing by over 500 million bushels.","In fact, as seen on Slide 6 meeting that trendline demand on a relatively stable footprint over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield gain for corn and a fourfold increase for soybeans.","So, the innovation that we expect to deliver with our leading technology platforms as shown on Slide 7 will be necessary to increase productivity to meet this projected demand and we expect the combination with Bayer to amplify that rate of innovation. It all starts with our industry-leading Seed and Trait technologies, which reached approximately 400 million acres today as a result of our broad licensing approach, which Bayer has indicated that they will continue. This footprint serves as the foundation for future germplasm upgrades, new trade technologies, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes and finally, our unique and rapidly expanding Climate FieldView platform. To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we continue to expand our capabilities in genome editing, including a new agreement with the Broad Institute.","Our desire to expand the strong innovation core also stems from the myriads of game changing opportunities that we see in the horizon. We are very clearly entering a new era in agriculture. Hundreds of new entrants invested more than $4.5 billion of venture capital in agriculture in 2015, which is more than 10x the investment from just 5 short years ago. More players than ever are seeking to provide new technologies to growers to enhance productivity, both profitably and sustainably. This is for good reason. Demand requires that and we are pleased to see the investment to spur this needed innovation. Our shared vision with Bayer is to harness this wave of innovation and more optimally integrate into format that\u2019s usable and insightful to growers primarily through our Climate FieldView platform. By pairing Bayer\u2019s exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platforms, we expect farmers to benefit from accelerated innovation, expanded geographic and crop offerings and optimized integrated solutions from science-based recommendations, at investment space that secures the sustainable food supply needs and deserves this improved rate of innovation. So today Robb will expand in these examples as well as on our own pipeline update.","So, we look forward to updating you on the status of the deal as we move through this year. Until then, we are committed to operate as an independent company focused on delivering our plans for fiscal year \u201817 as well as our key business milestones. With growth in our Q1 results and outstanding demand for our new soybean technologies, we continue to expect our return to earnings per share growth for the full year. As Pierre will elaborate, we are reconfirming our full year ongoing earnings per share and free cash flow guidance with a small increase in our as reported earnings per share outlook.","So with that brief summary, let me pass it to Brett to elaborate on our operational path to delivering 2017. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thanks, Hugh and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum in South America. In the first quarter, we saw greater than 25% increase in planted corn acres in Argentina and more than a 10% increase in corn acres planted in Brazil. This was accompanied by double-digit price increases and corn germplasm and local currency in both countries.","In the U.S, the early read on the order books supports our intention to grow genetic share yet again. We have priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly with our new hybrids at a premium, maintaining our premium pricing compared to our competition. Demand for year one hybrids remains exceptionally strong and we are now in a sold-out position. Also, SmartStax remains a steady percent of our overall portfolio. In addition, we are prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics, but we have not seen any unusual levels of discounting to-date.","In soybeans, we expect to reach several significant milestones in 2017 as shown on Slide 9. We are off to a good start and still plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO soybeans in South America as shown on Slide 10. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. In Argentina, we have seen continued progress toward maintaining a reliable value capture. Recent renewal of the government resolution that enables a testing and invoicing protocol was positive and we continued to work with the industry coalition to secure a seed bill that encourages and rewards investment.","Continuing with soybeans on Slide 11, we are well supplied for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and our order book reflects the overwhelming pent-up demand for this technology. With the EPA approval for in-crop use of dicamba in-hand and as of this morning, we have now already received nearly three-fourths of the necessary state approvals for both soybeans and cotton, which covers the vast majority of the acres and we expect to have the rest before planting. We are conducting extensive training on the use of Xtendimax and the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system delivering multiple training opportunities and tools to provide customers with an excellent experience with the technology.","Moving to our cotton business, we had a strong start in the first quarter with increased acres in Australia. And in the U.S, we now expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton area to exceed 4 million acres including a per acre trade premium. Additionally, this season we will have an introductory release of Bollgard IIII XtendFlex cotton with a full scale launch planned for 2018. This is the first cotton product ever to combine three modes of action for both insect and weed control. Finally, we expect 2017 to be the third consecutive year of share growth in U.S. cotton, coming on the heels of more than 8 points of branded and licensed share growth in 2016.","In Ag Productivity, we are focused on the launch of Xtendimax herbicide with VaporGrip Technology. In addition, generic glyphosate prices have continued to trend favorably over the course of the last several months and our strategy to price just above generics with our glyphosate-based herbicides has already led to some small price increases in the U.S. We also saw nice uptick in glyphosate volumes in our first quarter. However, we did experience the expected glyphosate pricing headwinds and anticipate those will continue into the second quarter as the current global pricing is lower than the prior comparable period. As a partial offset, we have just recently signed an agreement to sell our Latitude weak fungicide business for $140 million. Subject to the closure, we expect to receive an EBIT benefit of approximately $85 million in this segment in the second quarter. This sale is part of our continued efforts to focus and optimize our product portfolio and puts the asset into the hands of Mitsui, who has more potential to drive a greater level of value out of the asset.","And finally, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 12, continues to see major advancements as the business and the platform continues to evolve. We released four new product enhancements for 2017 and these upgrades together with outstanding demand for FieldView Plus and Drive have us well down the path to our goal of 25 million paid acres. Simultaneously, we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year and continue to grow geographically with expansion expected in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and Canada this year and in addition to plans to launch in Australia, Argentina and South Africa in the next few years.","With that, I will turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Brett and good morning to everyone. Let\u2019s start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our Southern Hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximately 50% in the first quarter with 6 points of gross margin improvements, led by Intacta penetration and currency benefits. Corn gross profit grew by more than 30% due primarily to double-digit price mix lift in local currency in both Brazil and Argentina and from strong growth in acres planned in both countries.","Finally, total operating spend decreased with reduced restructuring expense more than offsetting increases from the pending Bayer transaction costs, currency and growth in commissions in South America. Our Q1 free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion reflects strong U.S. cash freight demands and includes the payment of the previously accrued PCB personal injury settlements.","Let\u2019s move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 13. On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our fiscal year \u201817 EPS to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.45. These earnings are expected to translate into $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows. On an ongoing basis, our fiscal year \u201817 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, reflecting the growth we expect for the year. Despite the fact that the year-over-year change in currency rates was modestly favorable for us in the first quarter of \u201817, we continue to assume that the changing rates will have a relatively neutral effect on the full year basis given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies.","Our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit is still expected to increase mid single-digits as a percent year-over-year with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20% driven by new trade penetration and anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains and global germplasm price mix lift in local currency that we expect to be flat to up low single-digits in terms of percentages. We expect global corn acres to be roughly flat for the full fiscal year with declines in U.S. corn acreage offset by the early increases in South America.","Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is now expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides in the first half of the year offset partially by the benefit of licensing opportunity and expected higher volumes. The adjustment to our gross profit outlook is simply reflecting the fact that the approximate $85 million benefit from the sale of the Latitude business was ultimately recorded in other income for the segment as opposed to gross profit as originally anticipated.","Finally, we expect roughly $100 million of gross profit from strategic licensing deals towards the end of the fiscal year roughly split between the two segments of the business. Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives remain on track as shown in Slide 14 and the estimated cost to deliver those actions and initiatives is now down slightly to approximately $1 billion. We continue to see this opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings in operating expenses and cost of goods at the close of fiscal year \u201817 as compared to fiscal year \u201815. However, overall operating expenses in fiscal year \u201817 setting aside the pending Bayer transaction cost and restructuring expenses are expected to increase slightly re-inflation, the cost associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting our savings. The expected tax rate for the year remains in the range of 25% to 28%. If we narrow the view to our second quarter, we expect as reported earnings per share and ongoing earnings per share to be roughly $0.20 to $0.50 better than the prior year. Beyond the continued momentum in our corn and soybeans businesses, the expected first half earnings improvements reflects the benefit from the sale of the Latitude business and the absence of significant portion of the Argentine peso devaluation.","Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect roughly $0.40 less in EPS benefit from strategic deals versus the prior year plus a more challenging currency environment than what we experienced in the first quarter. However, with the strong start in the first quarter and our continued focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, we remain confident in our outlook for fiscal year \u201817.","With that, I will now pass it to Robb to share the update on the pipeline. Robb?","Robb Fraley","Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. So, this update is something I look forward to every year. It\u2019s a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. I believe our science and our pipeline are stronger than ever. In fact not only is this the fourth consecutive year of more than 20 pipeline advancements, but our advancement class of fiscal year 2017 also brings a record 14 projects advancing to commercial launch.","As I think about what our teams have accomplished, the most notable highlights are summarized on Slide 3 of the pipeline update deck. What I think is just as impressive as the 28 advancements is the remarkable balance of the advancement class. It showcases the depth and the breadth of the pipeline and this marks the sixth straight year where projects have advanced across all of our R&D platforms whether it\u2019s breeding, biotech, biologicals, crop protection or digital ag and climate. Climate has made incredible progress this year and the digital ag pipeline is now the most robust in the industry with more than 35 projects in R&D, including 6 advancements to commercializations that are all part of the paid elements of our platform.","So, what does this all translate to? Basically, our core pipeline is expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales with additional upside if we include our newer platforms like Climate and Biologicals. And frankly, I believe the story gets even more exciting with Bayer. We truly see the opportunity to accelerate innovation, optimize integrated solutions and expand offerings and this translates to significant benefits to farmers and I will bring this to life with a few examples later on.","But first, let\u2019s take a look at what our customers can expect from our leading hybrids and varieties shown on Slide 4. Starting with corn, DEKALB continues to deliver the industry\u2019s best performance, marked by 11 straight years of outperforming competitive products and the margin is significant as we see a consistent 7 to 10 bushel per acre average yield advantage. Soybeans have outperformed for the seventh consecutive year with a greater than 2 bushel per acre average yield advantage and cotton continues this trend as well. Deltapine cotton is again outperforming the competition for the seventh consecutive year. So across the board, our breeding engine is delivering results that our customers can count on. That industry leading germplasm performance is being protected by next-generation versions of insect and weed control traits.","Moving to Slide 5, the story here is really around delivering wave after wave of upgrades for corn from additional modes of action to expand the spectrum for insect and weed control. We have significant insect control products coming in SmartStax PRO as well as Trecepta corn. And in weed control, our third generation product in Phase 4 offers tolerance to glyphosate, dicamba and glufosinate to offer growers maximum flexibility in applying the herbicides that make the most sense for their operations. Longer term, the fourth generation insect and weed control traits get even better and this is really remarkable progress towards developing new products for farmers.","Moving to soybeans on Slide 6, we have the opportunity to extend our leadership with insect and weed control solutions. You know there is a good reason why we expect Intacta to land on between 45 million and 55 million acres in South America this year. The technology really works well and the next generation technology is going to work even better. It has multiple modes of action that not only improve the durability of the platform, but also expand the insect spectrum across the broader range of pests that growers care about and that product is already in Phase 4 along with the third-generation of weed control. Again, much like in corn, the next generation insect and weed control traits further enhance durability and spectrum providing new solutions for growers.","Let\u2019s now move from the technologies that have been core to our strategy for years to ones that I think could be transformational in the years ahead. There is a huge opportunity with genome-editing and I have talked recently about the number of deals that we have inked in this space. We are now using these tools to develop the next generation of products that will populate our pipeline in coming years. The deal with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that you referenced is an advancement that has the potential to enable more complex gene edits at an even greater efficiency and that adds to our growing portfolio of capabilities. So with the tools we have at our disposal, we believe we have established a path for developing and commercializing crop improvements based on genome editing.","Our story in biologicals just continues to get better based on our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes as shown on Slide 7. We are especially excited about Acceleron B300 SAT and think it could have a fit on more than 90 million acres. And farmers are going to get their first look at this product this year. Further, we had another year of outstanding results for our NEMASTRIKE Technology with approximately 2 bushels of yield advantage demonstrated in soybeans and 7 bushels in corn and we remain on track for a 2018 launch of this blockbuster nematode control product.","Let me focus now for a few minutes on how the pending combination with Bayer would further accelerate our pipeline and innovation in agriculture as shown on Slide 8. I have talked a lot about the benefits that this combination will bring and I think the bottom line is this deal is an innovation catalyst and we expect it to benefit farmers by optimizing and expanding R&D investment and allowing us to really up our gain. It will accelerate the pace of scientific innovation and our ability to provide integrated seed trait and chemistry solutions. And finally, it will allow us to expand our technology platforms into new crops like wheat and geographies like Asia and Africa. The combination with Bayer is transformative. It\u2019s about putting a complementary pro forma R&D budget of approximately $2.7 billion together to solve the challenges that farmers face and that our industry and society has an obligation to meet.","Let\u2019s start with an important example of accelerating innovation based on combining the highly complementary portfolios from Bayer and Monsanto on Slide 9. Today, herbicide tolerance is the cornerstone consideration for farmers making seed purchase decisions across the number of crops. The R&D challenge is that sequential development of first the herbicide and then the accompanying biotech trait takes a long time. So, the opportunity lies in developing both trade and chemistry on parallel paths and doing so can shave years of the delivery timelines of a new herbicide tolerant system and the accelerated earnings can be invested into additional areas of R&D. We are pursuing this route with PPO tolerance in our agreement with Sumitomo today and we have got the opportunity to do even more with Bayer\u2019s next generation herbicide candidates.","A second example on how the combination with Bayer enables better integrated solutions for farmers is shown on Slide 10. Giving farmers information to select the best combination of seed, trade and crop inputs enables them to make better planting decisions to drive productivity, profitability and sustainability on each field. For example, by knowing exactly which portions of the field needs immediate attention being able to precisely identify the exact pathogen and then quickly determine which fungicide is optimal can help mitigate developing crop disease problems. The detailed knowledge of crop genetics, agronomic practices and local weather, combined with Climate\u2019s imagery, full season sensor data and machine learning algorithms to identify specific diseases can alert and guide farmers to make faster and more informed decisions to protect yields from fungal diseases. So this is where the future of agriculture is heading and these examples are just some of the possibilities that we see.","So in summary, on Slide 11, it\u2019s been another terrific year for the team. We have made phenomenal R&D progress that is balanced across the portfolio. In breeding, we are maintaining the performance advantage that our customers have come to expect. In biotechnology, the story is really about protecting the platforms with newer and better next-generation seed \u2013 next-generation insect and weed control traits and our new innovation platforms are developing cutting -edge products like B300 SAT and NEMASTRIKE Technology along with the 6 new products we have launched in our Climate FieldView platform. Our strategy has been focused on optimally integrating these leading platforms and the combination with Bayer will allow our two companies to accelerate the pace of innovation and bring new products to farmers faster through our shared vision.","So with that, I will pass it on to Laura for Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks, Robb. With that, we would now like to open the call for 20 minutes of questions. [Operator Instructions] Christine, I think we are ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Robb, maybe a question for you, the USDA in recent years has become \u2013 from a regulatory perspective, things seemed to have taken longer and obviously there is a change in the administration coming. So, I am just wondering if you have any view on whether some of the extensions in the regulatory process at least from a USDA perspective, how transitory those could be as we head into the new administration whether regulatory lead times might mean revert back to where they were previously?","Robb Fraley","Thanks and Happy New Year. I would say that from a USDA perspective, I would actually give credit to the administration that Secretary Vilsack has in the last several years sped up the USDA part of the process. Obviously, we are delighted to have gotten our approval for Roundup Ready Xtend through the EPA, but that was a 6 or 7-year process. And I like the conversation that\u2019s going on about improving and streamlining the regulatory process, not only here in the U.S., but I think around the world and that would certainly be a tailwind going into future years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Yes, thanks. To your question on the earnings growth outlook post 2017, I mean, your guidance this year implies return to mid single-digit earnings growth. I know both at the Whistle Stop and in some recently disclosed long-range plan projections you have talked about an acceleration post 2017 to the mid-teens. So I am wondering is that still the case and is the driver there really the internal innovation as highlighted by Robb\u2019s pipeline review or are you banking on an improvement in agricultural fundamentals?","Hugh Grant","Don thanks for your question. I will maybe ask Pierre to say a few words as it relates to some of our early projections, but quite frankly, we are more focused on delivering on 2017 than looking up beyond that at the moment, but the kicker when you get beyond \u201817 is more based on innovation and unlocking growth in our soy and cotton platforms more than the anticipation of rebound in the ag economy, but Pierre, anything that you would add from planning on an assumptions point of view?","Pierre Courduroux","No, I think the key message, Hugh is \u2013 or Don you said we are not changing our views regarding the future compared to what we shared at the Whistle Stop. So as he was mentioning although we are actually still very bullish about the future of agriculture and based on the demand and the demand growth that continues to happen in both corn and soybeans, I mean, the key growth drivers as we shared at Whistle Stop are based on innovation and we see that in our first quarter with the success of Intacta, but our soybean technology is ramping up in the next 2 years are going to be very important and from a corn perspective we strongly believe that there is definitely room for the germplasm and improvements to continue to see growth into the segment. So no change is down compared to what we shared at Whistle Stop.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, hi, good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning, PJ.","PJ Juvekar","In Latin America, you had double-digit pricing growth in the quarter. Maybe this was driven by the weaker real a year or 2 years ago, but the real is trending now and does that mean that you lose some of this pricing power going forward?","Hugh Grant","Well, Grant, maybe you have just recently been there. I think PJ, the headline on this is we are delighted to the fact that we could compensate with double-digit price increases in Brazil and in Argentina. You will see some of that smoothing, but Brett, maybe a little bit more color?","Brett Begemann","Thank you, PJ and good morning. I think it\u2019s a couple of things. Definitely, the change in the currency relationship created part of the opportunity to reach for some of the pricing improvements around double-digits. And by all means even double-digit did not bring back everything that we lost from the past with the currencies. So there is potential opportunity as we continue to look to the future there. At the same time what I think just are more important is the continued performance of our products down there. Intacta continues to do incredibly well. As Robb talked about in his update, we have the son of Intacta right behind that. So, we are looking before the turn of the decade of launching the second generation of Intacta. Our corn portfolio continues to do extremely well down there. We have those next generations of insect control coming there and then germplasm performance as Pierre mentioned. So, all of those things combined setup nicely to be able to continue to look into the future and see incremental value as we deliver incremental value to the farmer, currency being a piece of that, but also the performance of the products.","PJ Juvekar","And secondly keeping with the R&D thing, a question for Robb. Robb, what do you think the CRISPR technology will do for you in terms of genetic gains and when do you seek commercial products out of CRISPR? Thank you.","Robb Fraley","Sure, thanks. And it\u2019s great question, PJ. So, may be just a little bit of background on the gene editing commentary. So, I think first of all as you recognize there is a variety of gene editing tools. There is protein base. There is nucleic acid base. And just in the last few weeks, there has been a couple of publications on two brand new gene editing systems that have been discovered. In any case, what these tools allow you to do is to go in and precisely change basically any base pair or any gene in the crop. And so there are very powerful tool for making precise changes. I think the other thing that\u2019s important to highlight is you still need a world class breeding engine, a testing network in order to identify and evaluate the best combinations and those gene-editing traits are going to be introduced into corn and soybean and cotton stacked with the biotech traits that are defining the marketplace today. So, we see them very complementary to the breeding and trait engines that we have developed. And I think they will allow us to further accelerate that rate of gain. And I think the fact that we have now concluded licensing agreements with some of the major players and innovative technologies puts us in a great position to take advantage of these products. I mean some of the first gene editing products and some of the smaller crops are working their way through the regulatory system. As I indicated in my comments, we are now fully utilizing these tools and certainly by the beginning or middle of the next decade we will see these gene-editing products work their way into the marketplace. Really an exciting technology and I think we have created a strong position moving forward into the space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. Good morning. When you generally reconcile what Brett\u2019s team is asking for from customers in the field versus Robb\u2019s R&D initiatives for his team, how do you generally feel your overall long-term strategy is paired and also versus your peers. And then also what were the one to two most pleasant surprises in terms of R&D advancements over the last 12 months and are there even maybe one to two areas which you believe will require additional focus over the next 12? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","So, Chris, thank you. I will maybe ask Robb to cover the second piece on pleasant surprises. It\u2019s always nice to talk about pleasant surprises at the start of a new year. In terms of the balance between what our customers are asking for and what R&D is producing. You never get complete synchrony in that, but I think over time, we have done really well in two areas. One is anticipating what growers need. Robb made the point that Xtend took 7 years to get through the EPA and that\u2019s been a frustration where the limits haven\u2019t been great signs, the limits have been the regulatory pace and we sincerely hope that that\u2019s going to change. And then I think the other great thing that we have been successful and in this balance that you refer to Chris is having second, third and then sometimes fourth generation products sequentially developed, so that as we are growing acres and meeting demand we have got the next product in development and ready to mover through. So, I would say those are probably two of the synchrony elements, but Robb, pleasant surprises and\u2026.","Robb Fraley","Yes, I think the only thing I would add to you is the comment that you made in terms of how do we make those decisions and trade-offs. I think one of the things that\u2019s always been a hallmark of our portfolio process is that from day 1, we integrate our R&D and our commercial thinking together and so we are trying to bring all of this together to make the right solutions happens for farmers. Chris, I think your core question on what had been the pleasant surprises maybe the hardest question I get this morning, because we have had some terrific results across the platform. I mean, you saw the breeding results there great and with the genome-wide sequencing, with the expansion of our testing facilities that we will have in the Southern U.S. to do more of that work in the greenhouse, we expect to see breeding gains accelerate. We are in a privileged position with building on the fourth and fifth generation of traits. If you had a chance to go through our tour this summer, we have discovered more new insect control genes in the last year than the industry has discovered in its entire history. So that\u2019s a great surprise. I flag the progress in Climate I mean to have now 35 projects in their pipeline. They are hitting on all cylinders. And when you go to our new innovations area, I mean, we are probably talking about being able to launch the largest microbial product ever with B300 SAT. The gene editing tools have really matured quickly in our hands. And I think the NEMASTRIKE product is going to be a blockbuster product in our portfolio. So, it\u2019s hard to pick favorites. There has been some really exciting progress this year.","Christopher Parkinson","Great detail. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thanks. Good morning. Brett, looking at pricing this coming season, what\u2019s your level of confidence at what happened last year in terms of the discounting will not reoccur this growing season?","Brett Begemann","Well, looking specifically at the Northern Hemisphere and narrowing it down to the U.S. given that we are already in the early days of January, I feel somewhat better about that because it\u2019s limited opportunity at this point in time. We are prepared. We are watching everyday to make sure that we maintain our position in the marketplace, but as the days and weeks go by here, the risk of that deteriorates pretty rapidly. Most farmers are well through their path of that decision-making and what they intend to do and making those final purchase decisions, so it\u2019s the opportunity to influence that becomes more limited and I think the industry understands that.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Evans","Yes, good morning. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Again, we are seeing headwinds from glyphosate pricing. Could you describe maybe when that could find a bottom given that I think in previous quarters you mentioned that some of these exporters might be operating near breakeven?","Hugh Grant","Yes, I will maybe ask Brett just to put a bit of color on timing. I mean, the good news, Chris, as we have seen \u2013 we have seen an uptick on Chinese pricing as we referred to in our prepared remarks and we made small move in the U.S., but if you look at the season coming and the spring through early summer timeframe maybe just a little bit of color on how price could play out in that timeframe?","Brett Begemann","Sure, Hugh and good morning. I think the key thing about as we look at the first quarter what transpired in the first quarter with glyphosate is very consistent with what we expected. We expected our pricing to be less than the comparable period to last year. That being said, we do see really positive indicators as Hugh noted with the asset prices starting to move in China in the right trendline or a positive trendline. We are seeing that starting to show up in the generics. That\u2019s what gave us the opportunity to make the small adjustment in our price to the positive side in the U.S. We continue to watch the rest of the markets around the world and we will continue to look for those opportunities. And my anticipation at this point is we will continue to move in that direction for the reason that you noted. It\u2019s not been an exciting business for many of them. The other point that I would make is not only did we see some improvement in that area. Our volumes are really strong in first quarter in our brand of business. So I feel really good about our position in the marketplace and how we are priced and the trendlines are favorable at this point.","Chris Evans","Thanks, everyone.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Yes, thank you. Just wondering whether you think you will likely commercialize Xtend soybeans down in Argentina if that country promulgates a seed law as currently drafted that has some limits on royalty payments to 3 years or fewer. Is that commercially viable for you?","Hugh Grant","Well, we have been \u2013 so first of all, we are really pleased to see progress in Xtend and hope to see it spread across Brazil and Argentina, but we have been watching the development of this very, very closely. I mean, Brett, maybe a little bit of color on our stance and the position that we have taken there.","Brett Begemann","Yes, sure and good morning, Steve. I think it\u2019s really important when we think about Argentina that we step back a bit and look at \u2013 put a little context around it. We have been at this for sometime now working with the farmers and the government to get a system in place. And we had one and that got disrupted, but the good news was last summer in about June, there was a resolution that put it back in place where we could have mandatory testing as well as invoicing. That resolution has been extended. So, that gives us an opportunity for the next growing season that we could not just this one, but I guess we think about the next one. The coalition is working extensively with the government to build the new seed law. The previous seed law that you referenced with the 3-year for the industry is a nonstarter. I mean, 3 years of \u2013 compared to the rest of the world with the teams years of intellectual property protection is a nonstarter. So that would not encourage us to bring any additional technology to Argentina. At the same time, there is receptivity within the government and then conversations to look for a seed law that addresses their concerns and the industry\u2019s concerns and get to a place where it encourages investment in agriculture and to do that, you need you reward those that are driving innovation. So, we are prepared to continue to drive the innovation as Robb noted in our soybean portfolio. Most of those products have a great fit in Argentina, but until we see an improved situation and have more confidence around the value, we will stick with just working with Intacta right now and then we will look to others as the situation evolves.","Laura Meyer","And Christine, this is Laura. We have time for questions for one more.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","John Roberts","Thank you. With Kim China buying Syngenta and DuPont Pioneer working more closely now with Origin Agritech, can you give us an update on your relationship with Sinochem and what your thoughts are on China?","Hugh Grant","John thanks for the question. We have the relationship with Sinochem for a long time. It\u2019s a good relationship. It\u2019s a strong one. We have been working jointly on cotton business in China. So we see an opportunity in China. I think it\u2019s long-term. I think it\u2019s going to take a while and we anticipate the first biotech traits commercialized in China are probably going to be Chinese. So, it\u2019s a patient game. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s \u2013 one of the early questions was growth beyond \u201817 and the acceleration in growth beyond \u201817. We don\u2019t see China being a major contributor to that in the next 2, 3, 4 years. It\u2019s going to take a lot longer, I think.","John Roberts","Great, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you very much. So, to Laura\u2019s point, I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to join us this morning and for your support. Going forward, as we look into 2017, we will be streamlining some of our investor communications, particularly around conferences and I think that\u2019s typical of a target company at this stage and our combination with Bayer. However, we look forward to continuing to update you on our traditional quarterly earnings calls.","So as we close out this morning, it\u2019s clear that the year ahead will be a significant one for Monsanto and we are really clearly focused on our two key deliverables. To that end, our plan to return to EPS growth in \u201817 is tracking nicely, we are encouraged. And we have passed our first significant milestone with really strong shareowners support on the agreements combined with Bayer. So on behalf of the Monsanto team, I would like to thank you again for joining us on this call for your support and we would like to wish you all the very best in the new year. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"15051":["Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call June 28, 2017  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Laura Meyer - IR","Hugh Grant - Chairman & CEO","Brett Begemann - President & COO","Pierre Courduroux - SVP & CFO","Robb Fraley - EVP & CTO","Analysts","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","Don Carson - Susquehanna","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Steve Byrne - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","John Roberts - UBS","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo","Operator","Greetings and welcome to Monsanto Company\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings conference call.","At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Laura Meyer, Monsanto Investor Relations Lead. Thank you. Please go ahead.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Brenda, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team is Ben Kampelman.","Our third quarter call marks a passage of a significant portion of the Northern Hemisphere ag season and today we'll provide a summary of our third quarter results as well as the outlook for the balance of this year. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at Monsanto.com.","We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations and in line with our expectations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93 as compared to last year's as-reported earnings per share of $1.63 and ongoing earnings per share of $2.17.","From a free cash flow perspective, we had a use of cash of $158 million for the first three quarters as compared to a use of cash of $251 million in the prior year. Hugh?","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Laura, and good morning to those of you on the phone. Thanks very much for joining us today.","I'm pleased to share that we've returned another solid quarter for fiscal year 2017 and in doing so, have an even clear line of sight on our two priorities for the year, namely, delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and moving to closure on the Bayer merger agreement.","So, let's begin with the Bayer Path to Completion on Slide Six. Bayer continues to lead the filing process with support from Monsanto and continues to target closing by the end of the year. The filing in the European Union is expected to be submitted in the next few days and the response to the second request issued by the US Department of Justice was recently completed.","Once the EU filing is in, all key initial submissions will have been made. In addition, we've already received clearance from several regulators including South Africa for which Bayer agreed to provide remedies. The clearance progress has been steady and consistent and we remain encouraged by the advancement of other proposed combinations as our industry undergoes a healthy transformation to better serve the world's farmers.","And while other deals have their merits, we believe this merger is uniquely beneficial as shown on Slide 7. It has the capacity to benefit growers by accelerating innovation, by delivering integrated solution tools and by expanding offerings to new crops and geographies at a time when they're most needed.","One other benefit it delivers is complementary R&D expertise to enhance discovery efforts leading to increasingly meaningful benefits for growers around the world, and global agriculture needs to get there to solve the conundrum of growing more with less inputs.","We know that there are ways to grow food better, smarter and more efficiently. Collectively, we've created and delivered many of the building blocks necessary to meet future needs, but there is still much more to do.","Despite near-term supply, the demand for corn and soybeans continues to grow as shown on Slide 8. The rigors of climate change and competition for resources will only serve to intensify this need.","We're well positioned to develop this next generation of solutions as shown on Slide 9 with the broadly licensed climate FieldView platform and our strong foundation of seed, trait, and chemistry solutions. The combination with Bayer should only serve to accelerate our ability to bring those to the growers who need them most and our open platform continues to expand and evolve.","I'm encouraged by the positive farmer experiences that we've been hearing and seeing for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, Bollgard 2 Xtend Flex cotton and Climate FieldView as they reach record levels of penetration. In fact, combined these new technologies are on more than 125 million acres in the U.S. in just two to three short years.","In addition, we recently received several regulatory approvals for our products. In April, we received the EPA approval of Nemastrike technology keeping this blockbuster product on track for commercial launch in fiscal year '18.","We also recently obtained the EPA approval for SmartStax Pro, our next generation of cotton rootworm control technology, which we expect to launch around the turn of the decade, pending receipt of certain import approvals and finally, [Indiscernible] soybean just received the import approval from China, clearing its final regulatory hurdle for full commercialization in 2018.","These factors also play into the high-quality performance that our business is delivering with gross profit up more than 12% through the first three quarters. Our innovation leadership is driving our growth and the completion of our third quarter bolsters our confidence and the outlook for the rest of the year.","To that end, our guidance range for fiscal year '17 is expected to be at the high end of the range for as-reported earnings per share and has confirmed that the high end of the range for ongoing earnings per share despite the continued tough ag market.","I'm very pleased with what our team has accomplished, maintaining its focus while balancing our two imperatives. The business remains on its growth trajectory and the progress and the combination continues at a steady clip.","So, with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update, Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thanks Hugh and good morning to everyone on the line. Our focus on delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter and achieving our 2017 key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth through the turn of the decade.","Specifically, the ramp of our latest technologies has been record-breaking with Roundup Ready Xtend, Intacta and Climate FieldView. Our costs have been coming down in both U.S. corn and soybeans and our pipeline continues to advance.","As we delve into the specifics, let's start with corn as shown on Slide 10. This quarter is all about the Northern Hemisphere. Let's begin with the U.S. where we're sold out of our DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids in their first year of introduction and we remain on track for genetic share gains.","This was offset by lower than anticipated planted acres and a modest decline in our germplasm price-mix. A key inclusion on those disease shield hybrids was our Acceleron B-300 SAT microbial product, which was first -- was the first launch from the BioAg joint venture with Novozymes.","Early-season reaction has been positive and we look forward to seeing how the rest of the season plays out. In Europe, acres planted to corn year-over-year ended up relatively flat and our team delivered modest germplasm price mix lift in local currency along with anticipated genetic share gains.","Overall, we're still expecting our full-year global corn germplasm price mix lift to be flat to up low single digits as a percent in local currency, primarily driven by the strong double-digit growth in the first half in Brazil and Argentina.","For soybeans, the momentum continues to be tremendous in our latest technologies as shown on Slide 11. With 50% growth in gross profit in Q3 alone, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% growth in our soybean gross profit as well as strong margin improvement for the full year.","Let's start with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the U.S. as shown on Slide 12, where our ramp year for the trait has been outstanding. There are about 20 million acres planted across the country and we're hearing great feedback on the performance of the varieties and on the efficacy of the trait and herbicide system in managing tough to control weeds.","Based on information we have to date; the overwhelming majority of our customers are experiencing success with on-target application of Xtendimax with VaporGrip Technology and are following the label and good stewardship practices. So, I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season unfolds.","In South America, the strong performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO Technology once again underpins the record penetration we're delivering. For a fourth consecutive year, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO is delivering a greater than 4 bushel per acre yield advantage based on 2017 field trials.","With this continued strong performance, growers have added another 15 million acres this year, increasing penetration to more than 50 million planted acres across South America as shown on Slide 13.","Our focus is now shifting to next season where we have established the price in Brazil commensurate with the performance and reflecting an increase in local currency, which included the removal of the transition rebate that expired in fiscal year 2017 as expected.","In cotton on Slide 14, the growing experience with Bollgard II XtendFlex varieties and the ability to use dicamba herbicides in season has now driven our trait penetration to more than 5 million acres in the U.S. This is well over our anticipated penetration of more than 4 million acres and is nice to see given the substantial growth in cotton acres this year.","In addition, we're increasingly confident in our delivery of the third straight year of genetic share gains in cotton and look to build upon this in the years ahead with Bollgard III XtendFlex cotton.","Moving to our other crops, we still expect modest but steady growth in vegetables for the full year. We also continue to strategically manage our product portfolio as planned with two additional deals struck recently, one in ag productivity and one in seeds and genomics and we expect to receive the benefit in our fourth quarter results.","Shifting to digital tools, our Climate FieldView platform continues to see major advancements in its strategic differentiators in the space with our partnerships, collaborations and strong adoption as shown on Slide 15.","In terms of partnerships, we have signed up three new platform partners; Ceres Imaging, TerrAvion and Agribotix that will deliver valuable high-resolution imagery to farmers. In addition, in May, Climate acquired Hydrobio, an agricultural software company with unique irrigation-focused data and analytics capabilities.","This not only reinforces our partner of choice reputation in the space, but also expands the suite of products we expect to be able to offer farmers in the years ahead and we would expect to even more announcements here before the end of the fiscal year as we continue to evaluate more than 25 potential technology partners.","In terms of adoption, we are ahead of where we expected to be for paid acres, registering more than 35 million, well above the original target of 25 million acres. We also just recently announced our official commercial launch in Brazil after completing trials on nearly 1 million acres as shown on Slide 16.","With continued significant progress and adoption and partnerships and increasing interest in licensing opportunities, Climate FieldView remains a very promising area on the horizon force. As our Ag Productivity segment, we are now seeing, excuse me, we are now seeing the anticipated glyphosate-based herbicide price improvement translating to the retail market.","This has resulted in year-over-year improvement in gross profit for the segment for the third quarter and we expect this improvement in pricing will extend into the fourth quarter, despite year-over-year headwinds we saw in the past.","We're also increasingly confident in glyphosate's reregistration in Europe as discussions have been progressing positively. In addition, Xtendimax with VaporGrip Technology continues to contribute to the bottom line as trait penetration for the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system drives demand for low volatility dicamba formulations.","Moving to pipeline products as Hugh mentioned, we recently received the highly anticipated news from the US EPA that NEMASTRIKE technology has been approved. This puts us on track for commercialization in 2018 and allowed us to place hundreds of groundbreaker trials across the U.S. this year as shown on Slide 17.","As we've done with numerous new technologies in the past, these trials will give growers first-hand experience with NEMASTRIKE technology and will inform our launch for 2018. With blockbuster value and strong interest from licensors and growers, we're excited to move the technology into their hands.","All in all, this was a solid quarter in line with our expectations and as we look confidently to close out 2017, we've shifted our focus to growers in-field experience with our latest technologies, managing returns in the Northern Hemisphere and to the selling season in South America.","With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks Brett and good morning to everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered as-reported EBIT earnings per share of a $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93 in line with our expecting. Let's look at the specifics.","Our soybeans gross profit grew by 50% driven primarily by three factors in the U.S., the reduced cost of goods for Roundup Ready Xtend, the increased acres planted to soybeans and the benefit from the sale of those traded varieties.","Similarly cotton gross profit improved by 31%, thanks to the increase in U.S. planted acres, greater Bollgard 2 Xtend Flex acreage and genetic share gains. Corn gross profit was down slightly, in line with expectation and mostly due to lower planted acres in the United States, coupled with the previously mentioned grower demand driven timing shift into Q2.","This was partially offset by lower cost of goods in the U.S. due to improved production volumes. Global corn price was essentially flat in a market where commodity prices continue to be challenging.","Finally, our crop season trades gross profit declined due to the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in the prior year. Ag productivity gross profit increased about 12% given the improvement in both pricing and volume for glyphosate-based herbicides and the continuation of Xtendimax, dicamba-based herbicide sales, coming through in the results.","Our SG&A and R&D expense increased about 8%, primarily resulting from increased incentive expenses driven by the growth in the business and from the increased investments in Climate.","However, we remain on track with our target of $500 million in savings by the end of the fiscal year 2018 as shown on Slide 18 across cost of goods and operating expenses as compared to our fiscal year 2015 base. These savings are helping to offset inflation rate increases globally.","Lastly, free cash flow fiscal year-to-date is a use of cash of $158 million versus the prior year use of cash of $251 million. This improvement reflects the increase in operating cash flows from the first three quarters as compared to the prior year. The increase in capital expenditure relates to the construction of the dicamba manufacturing facility in Luling, Louisiana.","Looking out for the end of the fiscal year as shown on Slide 19, we confidently expect our as-reported earnings per share to be at the high end of the range of $4.09 to $4.55 and again confirm our ongoing earnings per share at the high end of the range of $4.50 to $4.90.","Full free cash flow, we also still expect to be at the high end of the range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. As we look at the specific components of guidance, let's start with seeds and genomics gross profit, which is now expected to be up high single digit as a percentage for the year.","These reflects outstanding growth in both soybeans and cotton as well as modest growth in corn, partially offset by the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in Q3 of fiscal year '16.","In our other segment, Ag Productivity, gross profit is still expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, as both glyphosate and dicamba deliver anticipated results. As part of our continued portfolio optimization efforts, I am pleased with the recent deals we signed and we expect to receive the benefit of roughly $70 million in non-core asset sales gains in the fourth quarter.","About half of these gains will benefit the Ag Productivity segments and half will benefit Seeds and Genomics. Both are expected to be recorded in other income and are considered in our guidance.","Despite the recent weakening of the Brazilian Real, we still anticipate a change in currency rates year-over-year to be relatively neutral to earnings. And finally, we still expect our SG&A and R&D expense to be up mid-single digits as a percent, due to increased commissions in South America, incentive increases and greater spend at Climate, consistent with the drivers in the year-to-date results.","In closing, we're delivering solid returns on innovation and in doing so with financial discipline as we return our business to growth this fiscal year. We have confidence that the outlook for the balance of the year is on sure footing and we look forward to updating you at the fourth quarter.","Thank you for your time today and we that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions.","Laura Meyer","Thanks Pierre. With that, we would now like to open the call for 20 minutes of questions. As we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible.","Brenda, we're ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Just wondering this year Brazil in particular, had a big fly up in planted acreage similar in Argentina, but we've seen the local corn price in Brazil retreat a fair amount.","So, I am just wondering as you're thinking to the fourth quarter and I guess a little bit into fiscal '18 how are you thinking about where the acreage and your volume performance is going to be and you also had very strong price gains on seeds. So, do you think you can sustain those if we go into lower acreage and poor corn economic environment down there?","Hugh Grant","Yes, no that's good, I think we're taking a conservative outlook, but Brett may have a just little bit of color.","Brett Begemann","Yeah, good morning, Vincent. So, it was just exactly as you described as we look at Brazil, the local price for corn has depressed compared to last year so we obviously are taking that into consideration.","As we look at pricing, our genetic, we don't anticipate the same kind of improvement that we saw last year from a pricing standpoint and it will as we expect cut the acreage back a bit. So, we're planning for somewhat of a reduction in acres.","It's still too early to call from our -- from how we see it and what the acres will actually come back, but we do anticipate they will be down some. It's a bit stronger in Argentina as we look at the Argentina market with the demand for corn there and both domestically and from an export standpoint, but we don't see the same kind of pricing opportunity that we saw last year.","But we still feel really positive about the performance of our portfolio, the performance of our genetics and traits and our pricing will be fine going into next year and we still see growth occurring in that part of the world.","Hugh Grant","And it's probably fair to say Brett that we took -- we were careful in how we managed our infantry this year as well, how we sold out.","Brett Begemann","Yeah, we're in a great position in Brazil and Argentina. Last year as you mentioned Vince that the acres were up significantly and it's always a really good day when you find yourself with significant price increases in a sold-out position and that's where we found ourselves in Brazil this year.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you.","Brett Begemann","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Chris Parkinson","Thank you. Just a derivative of that first question, can you just talk a little more about the Intacta ramp as we stand today including anything left to do in terms of older, new varieties within your portfolio, the ramps in our Latin America South, progress and timing of Intacta 2 etcetera, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Yes, so good position on varieties. In fact, in many ways, we're seeing it play out with Xtend now as well. Because of the early delays, we get a chance to call it in the chessboard. But Brett, final steps and then the migration to 2s.","Brett Begemann","Yeah, so as noted in our call today, soybeans has had a phenomenal year, both in North America with Xtend and as well as Intacta to your question Chris in South America.","Intacta continues to do extremely well and the big, big driver on Intacta has been and continues to be another year of delivering four-bushel yield increase and that's where the real value is and so we're excited about hitting 50 million acres this year.","We continue to look to grow that into the total opportunity down there. We still expect somewhere around 75 million acres by 2019 on about 100-million-acre opportunity and we do continue to look at Argentina and building it out there, but again I remind you that in Argentina, insect pressure isn\u2019t as severe as it is in Brazil.","So, Argentina has never been as big opportunity as Brazil has been, but we do continue to build it out for Northern Argentina and work with the government on the system and what really gets me excited about Intacta in South America is the work our R&D team has done to bring us the next generation of Intacta 2 and we're already starting to build the plans to make the big transition from Intacta 1 to Intacta 2.","And as I've said for a couple years, I don't think we'll ever fully penetrate with Intacta 1. We'll be making the transition to Intacta 2 bringing in new technology with new and better insect control into the marketplace, but we feel reasonably good about where we sit right now in South America with soybean.","Hugh Grant","We're chasing 75 million acres by 2019. Thank you.","Chris Parkinson","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead with your question.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. Question on just guidance. You've indicated that you're now looking for higher gross profit in both Seeds and Genomics and Ag Productivity versus your previous thinking yet you haven't changed your overall guidance range. And just in terms of the impact of Xtend we're seeing a lot of dicamba drama and some concerns over off target issues and I know there's been some removal of in crop use in Arkansas. So, what overall impact if any do you see that having on the Xtend rollout?","Hugh Grant","So, Don, thanks for the two questions. So, Pierre maybe a little bit on guidance and our stance in guidance this year.","Pierre Courduroux","Yeah so Don, so as you know, historically Q4 has always been a smaller quarter and typically resulted in a loss and last year was somewhat unusual with the favorable impact of the sorghum JV deal that we had and better than anticipated final volumes in both corn and soybeans.","So, this year we're looking at a way more normalized volumes and the key thing there is we are also expecting half the amounts of deals that we had last year and this is one of the reason at this point in time since we've calibrated the benefits from deal around $70 million.","This is why despite the increase you see in our guidance on GP in both Ag productivity and seeds and genomics, modest increases there. You see that the total EPS not changing dramatically because we have scaled down some of our assumptions as well on the deals.","So, all in all, pointing to the high end of our guidance, you're looking at a year where we're looking at the double-digit growth for the full fiscal year in terms of EPS in a really challenging environment. So that's the way we're thinking about it now.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Pierre, and then your question on Xtend, Don, we've talked for years about the decade of the bean and this is clearly the year, the year of the bean. So, we're delighted with the rollout of Xtend. It took a long time to get here, but if you look at beans and cotton just to put some context in this, we've won 25 million acres this year from a standing start.","So, our biggest launch and at a time when growers are really looking for help with these resistant, Brett, against the backdrop of 25, how are you looking at it?","Brett Begemann","Yeah, so Don, you think about as Hugh pointed out, 25 million acres of combined corn and soybeans in the marketplace, that's a multiple fold larger launch than we've ever experienced with any technology and I think it speaks volumes to the farmer's need for additional tools and technology in the marketplace to control weeds.","What we've seen so far Don is the vast majority of farmers and applicators using our products are seeing great results both from a weed control and efficacy standpoint as well as the application itself and the product they input. So, we feel really good about what we're seeing.","I remind you to your point of the 33 out of 34 states have approved our Xtendimax with VaporGrip Technology, but Arkansas as you noted was one of them that never approved that product or was the only one that never approved that product.","As it stands today, as we look at inquiries across the entire country in the 34 states where we're approved, it appears that the Plant Board in Arkansas is getting a lot more inquiries than we're getting across the combined rest of the state or states that have approved Xtendimax with VaporGrip.","So, the key here is that it's the largest launch ever. The number of inquiries we're experiencing would be normal for any product, even products that have been established in the marketplace would experience a number of inquiries every year.","So, we feel really good about where we're at and we'll continue to work with every farmer that's purchased our technology and work with them to have a positive experience with. I couldn't be more excited about the performance we're seeing across all the states.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning, David.","David Begleiter","Good morning. How do you look at our market share playing out this year in the U.S. in both corn and soybeans?","Hugh Grant","I guess I would say early days, but we're feeling -- we're feeling good in both crops. There is possibility of a little bump.","Brett Begemann","Yeah, I am always cautious to get ahead of ourselves because returns and everything is not completed yet, but I do feel good today telling you that the indicators would tell us will we expect genetic share gains in the U.S. in our core business and soybean business as well and the one I'm more confident in is cotton because it's so strong and we've seen it for three years in a row.","So, I would tell you that it's kind of the triple crown on share growth across the three different crops this year in the U.S.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","Hi, you mentioned earlier about the potential pricing action you could take in Intacta. If I understand correctly, you've been constrained on being able to push price for Intacta the last three years limited by just the rate of inflation down there, but the Real is devalued by 50% in those three years.","So, given what you've described is the yield benefit and certainly cutting back on a number of applications, it got to be a meaningful value proposition to the grower. What kind of a price increase could we expect this fall on Intacta down in Brazil?","Brett Begemann","Yeah, thanks Steve and good morning. So, a couple things to keep in context and it's all consistent with the point you made in your question. Yes, we've been somewhat limited based on inflation in Brazil.","It's not very often when you're talking about inflation being your friend, but inflation has been our friend when it comes to pricing of Intacta. So, we haven't been holding our price flat in Brazil. We've actually been moving it up with inflation the past number of years. So, we have improved our position.","As noted there was a transition payment that was occurring from the old Roundup Ready formulation of trade to the new Roundup Ready 2 and Intacta and that expires and with that expiration, it feels a bit like a price increase to the farmer and a benefit to us because it just goes away.","So, it just extinguishes itself. So, we'll feel the benefit of that. So, we would expect going into this year that we'll see somewhere in the range of double-digit, but it still has to play out as we look at that transition payment expiring in the price move that we took, which was a positive uptick this year again on top of the previous years.","Steve Byrne","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Good morning. Corn replant acres have been relatively high this year. Can you talk about the magnitude of replants and whether that tightens up corn seed inventories at all industry wide?","And secondly, it looks like your operating expenses in Ag Productivity were really much, much higher year-over-year, maybe they were $89 million or $90 million higher over a base of $127 million. What happened to operating expenses in Ag Productivity?","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the two questions Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Sure.","Hugh Grant","Brett, maybe take the second one, second on Ag Productivity.","Brett Begemann","Yeah, so looking at the replants, it was -- Mother Nature was not kind to farmers. They started to plant early with great conditions and there's pockets where it just -- it became really tough and to your point, there were farmers re-planning for their second and third time unfortunately this year.","Here's the context and reminder, every year there's replants and if you're one of the farmers that's affected in that area, it can be devastating and it's incredibly frustrating, but when you look at it across the entire marketplace, it's always a relatively small percentage in total.","We accrue for that to occur in the marketplace. Jeff, I would guess there's probably a slight chance it's going to -- more than a slight chance that it's going to be more than average, but it isn't going to be all that high.","So to your point will it change our position with inventories etcetera? No, we're well prepared for that. The change in corn planted acres from last year to this year was more significant than the impact of replant. So, we're well-balanced going into next year.","Hugh Grant","And that would be the same across the industry and it's the second real piece. Pierre, on expense you saw in Ag Productivity.","Pierre Courduroux","So, Jeff, I don't have the details in front of me, but as our total spend, our total spend is increasingly the health of our business and we're seeing growth on both segments and some of that translate into commission in South America, some of that translate into higher incentives.","So specifically, regarding Ag Productivity I don't have as I mentioned the detail in front of me, but these are the key driver at the company level, which definitely play a lot in Ag Productivity since the bases is lower.","And there's also the launch of the dicamba formulations in the market that may also have impacted that. So overall this is together with the trends of our spending the company, which is really associated with the growth of the business.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you very much.","Hugh Grant","When you look at the yield on our forecast on what we expected, we're tracking with an expectation.","Pierre Courduroux","We're talking with an expectation, yes.","Jeff Zekauskas","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Thank you. Is there any update you could give us on where you are in the divestment you were buyer and the divestment process to satisfy anticipated any trust issues?","Hugh Grant","Not of this kind John. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think we're making steady progress and the next piece of visibility will be the submission to the European Union, which we're working towards by the end of this -- end of this month.","And given that, if that occurs in that timeframe, then we anticipate we would still be working towards closure by the end of this year and beyond that we've not based at this time?","John Roberts","And is there anything to learn from the canceled Precision Planting deal that you had with Deere, anything to learn about any trust issues or anything you could help us with their to understand why that didn't happen?","Hugh Grant","No, it's completely -- it comes as the second part of your question, but it's completely separate from deal with Deere and we continue to look at that process. We're pursuing old cabinet of purchasers at the moment. So, no, there's absolutely no linkage with the transaction.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks for your questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your questions.","Frank Mitsch","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Hugh Grant","Good morning, Frank.","Frank Mitsch","I wanted to follow up on John's question in a little different fashion. You mentioned that you received a South African approval for the transaction subject to a remedy I guess on the herbicide and seed side.","Was that in line with what your expectations were in terms of what would be necessary or is that higher or lower? Can you give us an order of magnitude of what the sales of that remedy was roughly?","And I guess do you think that that's something that might carry through for our other jurisdictions as well?","Brett Begemann","Yeah, thanks for your question Frank and I really can't comment on that. I've learned over the years and you've been on many of these calls over the years.","Speculating on regulatory processes is never a good idea. So, I think the next major one as a said is Europe in the coming days. I think our progress has been steady and sure, but I think commenting on individual jurisdictions is I don't think that's something that we should be doing at this stage.","Laura Meyer","And Brenda, I think we're coming to the close on questions now as we indicated at the start. So, we'll pass it over to Hugh to make some closing remarks.","Hugh Grant","No thanks very much, Laura. Let me just begin by thanking you for your support and patience on the lane today. We've felt this year that it's been important to continue to update our owners and investors. So, we thank you for your support.","I wanted to -- I wanted to thank my team as well who've done an outstanding job on delivering on our operational plan and our deal milestones, while we continue to serve and support our customers, the growers around the world.","And as we as we look at the work through the summer, that's going to remain our priority as we close out this fiscal year. So, thanks and congratulations on a strong performance that my team and with that, we look forward to joining with you and talk with you again in October as we close out this year. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."],"15085":["Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) F2Q 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call April  2, 2014  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Bryan Hurley - IR","Hugh Grant - Chairman and CEO","Brett D.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you. Mr. Hurley, you may now begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings update. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; as well as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining we from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann and Tim Boeker.","Because it reflects the first view on the North American season, the second quarter provides an important proof point of growth from our core seed and trait business, so our emphasis today will be on the confidence that provides in our outlook and our continuing growth opportunity.","This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides, and replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.","So, we'll move quickly to the discussion of our Q2 results and the outlook. The key highlights are on slide four. At an ongoing EPS level, we delivered 15% growth in the quarter. On the gross profit line, nearly 80% of the absolute growth comes from our Seeds and Genomics segment, and within that solid growth in both our soybean and corn portfolios. That was further highlighted by record second quarter gross profit in our soybean business, reflecting contributions from multiple elements of our soybean platform coming online.","The quarter also reflects strong progress on each of our full-year financial targets with improvement across our total company GP, Seeds and Genomics GP, our corn and soybean margins, and our ongoing EBITDA growth.","After delays in the early part of the quarter from extended winter storms on North American logistics, we were able to largely catch up on our overall shipments by the end of the quarter. And as a result, there's no change to our quarterly flow related to those early weather challenges.","With our strong seed and trait performance in Q2, we also anticipate a strong conclusion to the year with a significantly smaller loss in Q4 to punctuate the year and a Q3 that we expect to be somewhat lower than last year.","For the full year, we've reconfirmed our guidance for fiscal year 2014 ongoing EPS in the range of $5 to $5.20 and ongoing EBITDA growth in the mid to high teens. That outlook incorporates the reality that there are more headwinds across the ag industry this year, largely driven by currency effects which created an estimated $0.15 to $0.20 full-year EPS headwind relative to our projections and that are built into our guidance.","So, with that, let me hand it to Hugh for the strategic view at this second quarter.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line. With our largest quarter and the first proof points for the key northern hemisphere ag season in hand, I'd emphasize that our business is on track to deliver the growth we anticipated for fiscal year 2014.","This is a quarter where the outlook is as important as the financials. So, let me highlight three key points. Number one, despite the greater variability you see across the ag sector this year, today we've confirmed our full year guidance shown on slide five.","This is a year where everyone in agriculture recognizes the market realities of softer commodity prices, more volatile global currencies, and some decrease in corn acres in key markets like the Americas.","We're not immune to these trends and Pierre will quantify some of those macro headwinds in our outlook, but it's important that, even in a year with such prominent headwinds, Monsanto has the right portfolio to deliver expected strong growth for yet another year.","Next, the second quarter is actually the key proof point that in a softer commodity environment Monsanto is growing our core seeds and traits business. Almost 80% of our gross profit growth in the quarter comes directly from seeds and in particular, corn and soybeans. That's key as it means our seeds and traits business is delivering in the major areas and across the milestones that are critical to our success this year.","Third, that growth delivery is a direct function of the diversity that we have in a broader global portfolio. And within this balanced portfolio, we've a strong line of sight that reinforces our confidence in both a strong second half and the punctuation on this year's total growth.","This is a year where we wanted to see the seed business deliver as the prime growth engine and that's exactly what we see in this second quarter checkpoint.","That's important because the performance this year also unlocks a longer-term runway. There are two things that you look for in that opportunity; the demand-driven macro environment and the growth layers that are unique to us.","On the macro side, I think of 2014 as a transition year. With the effect of the severe drought in 2012 and the supply side pressures over the past few years, we've come through an abnormal period of some extreme conditions and inflated commodity prices.","But on slide six, expand the scope and look at demand in the context of the multi-year runway. As you do that, the macro environment normalizes and importantly, the long-term trends set the tone.","And those trends are strong, wide reaching, and compelling. The hallmark of the next 10 years is that demand cannot be met by increasing acres as we have over the past 10, so we see no real alternative other than boosting productivity. That's the concept of sustainable intensification.","We've built our business over the last decade to be ready for that generational opportunity. That opportunity starts this year and as we target that long-term demand-driven opportunity, Monsanto has more company-specific catalysts across more platforms than we have ever had. We show that in slide 7.","Brett will cover these in more detail, but the bottom-line is that the factors that play out in the longer term are more visible, more proven, and more transformational than they have ever been.","The first of those comes with record second quarter growth for our soybean business as we have the early validation on the decade of the soybean as one of our most transformational opportunities. That's highlighted by Intacta.","With our launch this year we have the data point to say that not only is Intacta out of the gate, but it started at a leapfrog pace at the beginning of 100 million acre market that we expect will rewrite our soybean growth opportunity.","The second factor comes as we layer on top of that the steady, expected growth as we use our breeding advantage to upgrade our seed portfolio every year, particularly in corn. It\u2019s a powerful point of leverage when you think that what we're doing has seen a steady growth contribution from our biggest global business year in and year out.","And finally, this year, we're unlocking new platforms that have the potential to be some of the most significant business drivers in our portfolio within the decade. These range from the precision ag platform that we've assembled under The Climate Corporation to our new biologicals platform with Novozymes.","These aren\u2019t significant financial growth factors this year, but we've clearly taken the first step to establish these as platforms that we believe can be completely new categories of opportunity.","Collectively, this is the broader global portfolio that we've consciously cultivated over the last several years. We've passed milestones in each this year, so the visibility that we have on these core company catalysts reinforces an important level of confidence that we have and why our continuing opportunity is so compelling.","And that brings me to my final point. There's no doubt that the ag environment has been more variable this year than it has been over the past several. And while there's still a lot to play out, I'm pleased that we've been able to demonstrate that our seeds and traits business can grow against that backdrop.","That speaks to the value of our technology and the strength of our portfolio. That in turn means that we're in a good position to deliver growth today while also building the platforms that access the important longer term opportunities in agriculture. So, we're on track, we see real opportunity in the demand trends, and we're focused on delivering.","So, with that, let me hand it to Brett to take a deeper dive into the operational milestones that are embedded in our results for this quarter.","Brett D. Begemann","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Coming into the year, we said that our seeds and traits business would return as the biggest driver of our growth. Within that I said our focus would be on margins, and specifically that we anticipated seeing significant margin expansion.","As we show on slide eight, that's on track. The proof point now shows on the financial statements in the quarter as margins are moving up in the overall seed business.","Let me walk through these drivers and give you the proof points, both for fiscal year 2014 and for our growth from here. Given the prominence of the North America season in Q2, I'll start with how the season is shaping up now that the order book is translating to the early shipments ahead of planting on slide nine.","With the market variability coming out of a very atypical 2013, there has been a heavier than usual focus on commodity prices, acre projections, and discounting noise. I see 2014 clearly playing out as a normal year and the growth we saw in our order book has carried through the early shipments, putting us on track for the strong growth in our global portfolio that we see driving our full year margin increases.","With shipments underway, we're on track for the 5% to 10% mix lift in our global corn seed portfolio. This year, we'd expect to be towards the lower end of that range as we factor in the global headwinds like currency.","There's real power in this significant, steady engine across our business. That translates to an expected greater than $1 billion of net sales growth over the next five years just from this corn germplasm upgrade, that's why this is such a powerful business factor.","In the quarter, the proof point is the margin expansion I mentioned. Corn margins are up approximately two and a half points and a portion of that is the global mix benefit the comes from our portfolio upgrade.","The first increment of our improved cost position is also starting to flow through and this COGS benefit in corn continues throughout the North America season. This has us well-positioned for the three point margin growth we expect for the full year.","Among the key seasonal factors, the next step comes as planting gets underway and the focus will be on the obvious variables; the weather and farmers' planting decisions. The winter weather slowed some of the pace of logistics on early deliveries, but hasn't carried over now that we are a step closer to planting.","As we saw last year, weather is more of an influence during planting and the spring weather window will help determine if incremental acres go to corn, soybeans, cotton, or elsewhere. Given the balance in our portfolio, we're in a good position to serve our farmer customers however these decisions shakeout. So that may change the composition of what we sell, but I don't think it changes the bottom-line opportunity.","If I shift gears slightly to slide 10, one of the things that I think gets missed with all the focus on commodity prices and acres is that we're on track for a record volume in our global corn portfolio.","In the quarter, we have a couple of new data points. Not surprisingly, with the second season largely planted in Brazil, it's clear that the overall corn acres were down in Latin America this year.","Against that, we now have the visibility on volume in the northern hemisphere and we're on track for volume growth for the year. If we look at Latin America, it's an important area where we hit strategic milestones this year. In Argentina, we're on track with the upgrade to the triple stack. Likewise, in Brazil, we're making progress on our next-generation traits.","In that regard, the corn opportunity has parallels to the Intacta in soybeans as the tropical insect pressure means the value and opportunity is really in the insect control traits. So, products like our double stacked insect control traits are really leading that upgrade trend.","As we move to the northern hemisphere, despite the obvious turmoil in the Ukraine, one of the most significant opportunities this year comes from the broader Eastern European market. It's really one of the fastest growing regions in our portfolio today because there's a trifecta of opportunity in germplasm mix upgrade, significant share growth, and a growing overall market.","Today, this is more than a 30 million acre market and one where we have effectively doubled our footprint in the last several years.","Relative to the Ukraine, we see the same factors as others in the industry. There has been some disruption tied to the political unrest, but we've been working through that and feel good about the full year contribution to growth.","This global expansion is key in delivering our growth this year, but it's perhaps more important in the long-term opportunity. We've a leading global position that spans markets and crops, so however the macro acres trend in any given year, there's an increased geographic balance in our portfolio. So, while the U.S. will still be the cornerstone for us, our overall growth isn't tied to one market.","From there the next driver is soybeans on slide 11. With Intacta, Roundup Ready 2 Yield, and the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend platforms we have entered a new era of opportunity and acceleration that can drive overall growth for years to come.","That shows in the margin improvement for the quarter. The seven point expansion is particularly strong in the quarter, as we have all of the drivers showing up in the financials ranging from Intacta sales to the next increment of contribution from Roundup Ready 2 Yield from U.S. licensing.","As all of those factors continue to grow, we expect more than $1 billion in net sales growth across the soybean platform in the next five years. There is no bigger 2014 milestone than the Intacta launch in Latin America on slide 12.","With this quarter reporting is largely in for the season and we've delivered the 3 million acres, making the Latin America rollout of Intacta the largest launch of a soybean trait in our history.","Just as importantly, we've emphasized our focus on the first year experience and we reached more than 13,000 farmers with our commercial rollout, up from the 1,000 participants in our Ground Breakers program last year.","We had more than 35 varieties in the market this year, more than double the varieties we had with our U.S. launch of Roundup Ready 2 Yield. We're still harvesting our seed production for next year, but we'd expect to double the number of varieties for 2015, reaching an even broader geographic area. That focus on the experience has us on track with some of the best first year performance we've seen in any trait we've launched.","The first feedback came with the heavy insect pressure that swept Brazil this year. With the emergence of a new caterpillar pest, Intacta is actually providing a better performing alternative that's giving farmers a new tool.","And on slide 13, with good progress in overall harvest, the new information we have today is the initial yield data from the very first commercial experience. With almost 50% of the data in from our testing, we're matching the better than four bushel an acre advantage we saw in Ground Breakers in the commercial experience. That comes in trials comparing Intacta against soybeans typically using multiple insecticide treatments. So, we're seeing both yield benefits and better insect control.","With the productivity gains from less insecticide use, the visible differences in insect protection, and clear yield benefits, this first year experience was a clear success. And that's the critical pacesetter we wanted to see as we start in 2015 what we expect is one of the fastest historical ramp ups as we target more than 100 million acres across Latin America.","Across the larger current portfolio, I'd just mention briefly that our ag productivity business continues to be on track. Our strategy and market outlook have been consistent with what we anticipated.","We've seen some continued financial benefit as our mix and market pricing have been in the range we expected through Q2. That trend likely puts us more towards the stronger side of our full year outlook for a steady to stronger contribution in this segment.","On the roster of what we needed to deliver this year, the last is establishing the foundation for one of the most transformational, long-term opportunities, the precision agriculture platform on slide 14. Today, it's one of our most promising opportunities with 1 billion acre runway, so the foundation we set this year is important.","We've brought all of our precision agriculture technology under the banner of our Climate Corporation platform. We see this as a family of products and that's a big advance, as it takes precision ag from the piecemeal offerings in the market today to a real, unified platform.","We've always viewed our strategic retail partners as a significant advantage in the precision ag space. This platform now touches more decisions on a grower's farm and retailers play a key role in many of those key decisions, ranging from seed selection to fertility to pest and disease management. And we're making real progress.","We have business agreements in process with all of our major retail partners. Combined these partners account for roughly half of Monsanto's U.S. business today and represent more than $25 billion in total sales every year across seed and all the key ag inputs and services.","This year we're beginning to take our overall platform to the commercial stage. As you look at this portfolio of products, it starts to resemble the multi-stack approach you see with biotech traits. With hundreds of thousands of acres in early trial within the precision farming family and an expected 20 million acres with access to the gateway tools of Climate Basic, you can see that this can be a meaningful platform quickly.","Since we made The Climate Corporation acquisition, there has been a lot more talk about precision ag in the industry, but I think, with our differentiated technology and emphasis on industry collaboration, we are the best-positioned with a true platform.","Let me bring all these data points together. When you look through the lens of fiscal year 2014, the drivers are on track. We're seeing the growth engine in seeds and both of those things are allowing us to deliver the growth we anticipate.","And with what we accomplish in 2014, we set up an important runway that allows us to grow now while we simultaneously position ourselves for that important longer-term opportunity.","So, with that, let me hand it over to Pierre.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Having heard about the business milestones that back our confidence in our performance and opportunity, let me now highlight the corresponding financial proof points that reinforce this confidence.","As I do that, I'll focus on a couple of key points that tie our Q2 results to our full year financial outlook. First, despite the greater variability in the overall ag market this year that Hugh and Brett called out, we're on track with our plans and we have the visibility to confirm our growth and guidance today.","It certainly helps to put some financial context to some of the industry headwinds and the two biggest of those are currency and lower corn acres in some key markets. Related to our initial planning, I'd estimate the full year headwind is largely driven by currency and would be in the order of $0.15 to $0.20 in total. The ability to overcome those headwinds and deliver growth really speaks to the strengths of our underlying business and our core growth engine.","Second, the strength of those business drivers actually creates a very clear line-of-sight to a strong second half of the year. We have communicated earlier that we expect a historically strong fourth quarter to punctuate the year. So, we expect to build on the good growth we saw in the first half with an overall strong second half and one of the strongest fourth quarters we've seen in recent years.","And finally, if I move beyond the P&L, we continue to make progress in our initiative to be more aggressive in our cash deployment. A key point in that evolution is that after a couple of years of effectively returning our total free cash to our shareowners, we're on track for fiscal year 2014 to use our balance sheet and return more than our generated free cash for the first time in our recent history.","I'll cover this cash use aspect in further detail, but let me first tie the specific financials from the quarter to our full year growth metrics on slide 15.","As you work down those metrics on the financial statements, you'll see that we're on track on each and every measure, and you will also see strong incremental progress towards each in the quarterly results.","Start with our overall gross profit outlook. Within that the biggest two points we said out to deliver was strong growth in our core seeds and traits business. Now that we've got into the heart of our business, it's clear that the seeds and traits growth we are focused on is being delivered.","In the quarter nearly 80% of our total gross profit increase comes from Seeds and Genomics. And if you look at the full year view, we expect seeds and traits to continue to drive our underlying earnings growth.","If you take that down a level to Seeds and Genomics margins, you see very good progress in the quarter and the first half toward our target of an increase of three to four margin points for the full year.","The biggest driver of that is clearly the soybean business where Q2 margins were up by more than seven points as we see the pronounced benefits from Intacta launch in Latin America, the strong soybean opportunity in our U.S. business and the first increment of the DuPont soybean royalty.","We'd expect this to ease a little with the seasonal business flow in Q3 before providing a significant list again in Q4, keeping us on target for our full year expectation for a margin increase of six to eight points across our soybean business.","The progress on corn margins is equally strong. In the second quarter we've seen margin improved by about 2.5 points. This improvement largely reflects our mix lift and the start of the expected cost benefits.","Going into the second half, we would anticipate an additional margin benefit from our cost of goods as we expect the cost improvements to be even more prominent in Q3 and to carry into Q4 as we stay on track for our full year target of three point margin lift.","From an operating expense perspective, we are running at a relatively higher year-over-year rate. That reflects both the dilution effect of the Climate Corp. acquisition and the additional investments we are making to support our record number of product launches along with our new growth platforms.","So while operating expenses will grow at a higher rate this year, these are disciplined increases and we continue to expect to see operating expense leverage from gross profit for the full year.","Taking all of those in consideration, we have already delivered a double-digit increase in ongoing EBITDA for this quarter, and we expect to reach our mid to high-teens EBITDA by the end of Q4.","Translating those metrics to our outlook for the rest of the year on slide 16, what you see is that we expect continued strength in our second half punctuated by a strong conclusion in Q4. That second half strength is mostly driven by three core structural factors, none are particularly variable and we have a good read on the specific timing of each.","Number one, we'll book the second installment of the DuPont soybean royalty in Q4. In combination with some of the incremental sales for the Latin America Intacta season that's a big driver of the significant growth we'd forecast for soybeans in our last quarter.","Number two, last year the combination of the anticipation of a jump in corn acres and the subsequent late season effects on the whether -- on U.S. planning caused an abnormal amount of returns that were reflecting in our corn numbers.","Practically, that increased our Q3 corn performance last year, but created a significant negative in Q4. As this unusual pattern normalizes, you'd logically expect the resulting shift this year could have the inverse effect reducing the Q3 comparator, while the absence of that drag creates a significant uptick in Q4 corn.","And number three, last year we took an inventory write-off related to our vegetable business that was focused in our fourth quarter. We have a less pronounced effect this year. We'd expect a more typical contribution from vegetables in one of its biggest seasonal quarters.","If you bring those factors together, we expect Q4 to be a significantly small or large than it was last year, near breakeven or at the small loss. And as many of you remember, for the past couple of years our Q4 has been a loss of more than $0.40, so these three factors aggregate to a significant benefit.","With a shift into Q4 I just described and some unique factors affecting the comparison, we'd expect Q3 to be lower than last year. The biggest factor comes with a significant tax benefit that increased our Q3 last year and doesn't repeat this year.","That is combined with the Q3 effect of the corn comparison to last year that I just described, and with the expected continuation of the trend on operating expenses that we had seen in the first half of fiscal '14.","In addition, the practical reality is that we don't expect any incremental growth from our productivity following last year's significant step up in the quarter.","So, as a result, the combination of the significantly stronger Q4 and the factors in Q3 translate to strong second half that punctuates many of the positive trends on factors like margin and growth drivers we've seen begin in Q2.","From there I want to focus on our cash priorities on slide 17. During the second quarter we officially entered the Novozymes Alliance. So in the first half of the year we invested approximately $1.3 billion into our business growth, primarily through Climate Corporation and Novozymes.","Our $290 million first half free cash flow reflects that investment and keeps us on-track for our full year free cash guidance of $600 million to $800 million including acquisitions.","Whether it's M&A, collaboration agreements in new platforms or CapEx investments into our core business, direct investment in growth opportunities is one of our priorities and where we can use our cash to unlock further growth.","At the same time, we're combining this direct investment in the business with a more aggressive approach in returning value to our owners. As I mentioned, we are on-track this year for the first time in our recent history to return to owners significantly more than the free cash we generate in the form of dividends and share buybacks.","Coming off a record for buyback spending in Q1 we've continued to build on that with an additional $200 million in buybacks in Q2 even with a $300 million outlay in the quarter for the Novozymes deal.","In the last four quarters, we've used more than $1.5 billion for share buybacks, moving us from an annual repurchase of less than 1% of our market cap to nearly 3% in that short time. As we look at our cash deployment strategy, we're focused on continued aggressive program that reduces our share count, the continued emphasis on dividend and looking to identify high return means to invest in our business.","So let me emphasize again our confidence in our earnings growth this year. Our strong underlying business continues to deliver the growth we expected. And even in the phase of the variability in acres, commodity prices and currency, we today affirm our full year guidance with confidence.","That puts us in a good position for long-term growth with strong cash generating capability that in turn allows us to continue that growth, while being aggressive in delivering value to our owners.","Thanks. And I'll turn the time back to Bryan for the Q&A.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Pierre. So with that we'd now like to open the call for questions. As we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person, so that we can take as many questions from as many people as possible. You\u2019re always welcome to rejoin that queue for a follow-up.","So with that, Rob, I think we\u2019re ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thank you and good morning, everyone. I just wanted to see if we could drill little bit more into the third quarter guidance. I just did -- the way I had been looking at it, last year you had revenue pulled out of 3Q into 2Q.","You had sort of a cost step up as your seed production cost seemed higher as you move through the year. So I would have thought that would have been a big tailwind in the quarter. I calculate the tax is $0.12, so it just seems like you're calling for the SG&A and R&D expense to be up substantially in the quarter. Is that right? Is that exactly what's going to happen?","Hugh Grant","Yeah. Vincent thanks for the question. I think the way I'd encourage you look at it is more or less story of our really strong second half, but the third does look a bit softer and the fourth looks really strong. But Pierre, maybe you can just do a little bit of dissection on how the comp looks versus last year.","Pierre Courduroux","Yeah. And so, there are a lot of variables playing when you do a year-to-year comparison. I mean especially when you look at corn, and as Hugh mentioned, I mean I would focus on an overall strong second half with very strong seeds and traits growth. You should get specifically to Q3, I mean you pointed it out, I mean the tax, the $0.15 tax benefit we enjoyed in fiscal year would be the biggest driver of the comp.","And then what we mentioned in our prepared remark as well, the corn impact of the late planning, I mean the conditions that didn\u2019t allow planning at the end of Q3 last year and impacted us fairly significantly in Q4 is also a fairly significant driver that maybe, Vincent, you didn\u2019t point out. And on top of that as you just mentioned, I mean obviously the increasing OpEx is going to play a role there.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","I see. So you expect corn and soy seeds and traits gross profit to increase in Q3 or to be flat or down?","Pierre Courduroux","So we'll see exactly how it plays out, but I would expect a flattish type of number.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Bryan Hurley","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Hugh, this is one of the few times you've actually reported the quarter after the planting intention surveys come out. And I know obviously whether and price moments will drive planting. But just wondering how you see the overall outlook because while corn is down and you cite that as a reason for some of your cost in Q3, got a big increase in soy in the U.S., increase in cotton. So how do you see the overall demand outlook playing out in the U.S. planting season versus last year?","Hugh Grant","Yeah. I mean, so the -- I think the number that was published yesterday was 91, and third quarter was 92. I think that would be in line with our expectations, Don. It's interesting you look at year ago, and the question was why can't it be 100? So I think 92 this year is I think is within the boundaries of realism.","Yesterday cotton finished the day north to $5, so $5 environment and 92-ish million acres of corn I think is a reasonable plan and assumptions going into the year. Beans looks strong and we've seen great performance in our bean franchise, not just in North America, but as Brett mentioned, in Brazil as well. But I think to answer your question; I think this within the expected norms.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Let me rephrase the question then. With overall acreage of your three core crops up 2 million year-over-year, presumably some market share gains with your strong performance in corn and soy last year, would you expect your domestic volumes to be up this planting season versus last year?","Brett D. Begemann","Don, this is Brett. If you look at the -- excuse me -- the total acreage in the core crops, corn kind of where we expected. Soybeans may be a tad higher that what we were anticipating.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Right.","Brett D. Begemann","And the cotton acres pretty close to what we have been anticipating for the cotton acres. So there's still room for that to happen across the mix of all those crops. But recognize that while we're extremely well-positioned in all three crops and the tradeoffs don't bother us near as much as they do others that participate in this space, the value creation per acre is slightly different across those three different crops.","So I feel really good about our second quarter playing out really strong regardless of how those acreages end up getting planted across the crops. But it's the extra acres that we're seeing are coming -- if they come, are going to come from the soybeans as it's projected today, which would be the lower value of the those three crops. But I feel like we're in a really good position going into second half.","Keep in mind that when you look at our corn business, we're looking at it globally, and the clear global corn acres are down for the first half and anticipated also in the second half. So I think the mix were still in a good place.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","But Don, just to your rephrased question, I think on volume it's early days, but based on our performance and our order books, we would anticipate volume will be up.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Okay. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.","Chris S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Group","Perfect. Thank you. You flagged $0.15 to $0.20 of agricultural headwinds concerning some FX and lower corn acreage. Can you parse out some of this for us little bit further, and just flag the largest headwinds, potentially on your FX assumptions for the concerned geographies? And then also, what your expectations will be for these currencies for the balance of the year? What's inherently embedded in your guidance? Thank you.","Pierre Courduroux","So, definitely those headwinds are embedded in the guidance. I mean that\u2019s one of the points we wanted to make. And when you're looking at the $0.15 to $0.20 we've been quoting, this is for the full year.","So just to make things clear there, most of that is related to headwinds -- to currencies, sorry. And as far as currency, the biggest factors there will be South America. I mean we've seen that in the first half of the year, South America, I mean specially Argentina, but also Brazil have been the key points in the currency headwinds we've been looking at.","Chris S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Group","Can you give any color on this, specifically what you're looking at for both Brazil and Argentina? And also are you embedding anything for Eastern Europe as well?","Pierre Courduroux","So, Brazil and Argentina, as I said, are the major drivers. And out of the two, Argentina will be the largest one. I mean the currency depreciated by almost 25% during Q2, so that's been a major event.","So Brazil and Argentina will be the biggest drivers. But we've also some headwinds around the world, because actually what we've seen in the second quarter, as you know, is that the dollar has been actually really strong against emerging market currencies and some emerging market currencies also in Eastern Europe has been affected. This is how we come to that $0.15 to $0.20 downsize for the year versus our original thinking.","Chris S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Group","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","Was wondering if I could ask Hugh about the U.S. corn market and how the mix of your product has shifted? Specifically I'm curious on what kind of penetration or percentage rights you're getting in SmartStax and then across your products in a Refuge-in-a-Bag format?","Hugh Grant","Bob thanks for the question. We continue to see -- based on the order books we continue to see really nice growth on SmartStax and the RIB product, so they really become flagship products. And as you look at some of the talk across resistance and you see growers reaching more and more for the SmartStax products, and its from the early days we've really build out the varieties, so we got our best germplasm and best varieties represented in SmartStax.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","And if I might ask, you've provided a nice historic trend on the Roundup Ready 2 in the launch year in a few years out, is there any reason we shouldn't expect you could quadruple or better your Intacta year two sales. I know you'd spoke to many more varieties being available.","Hugh Grant","Yeah. We've never quantified in that way, but what I will say, Bob, is that the ramp on Intacta will be faster than any of our previous ramps in soybeans. And that's for two or three reasons; one, really big growers in Brazil; two, pent-up demand; and three, the extraordinary performance versus insects. So I think it's going to go really fast. There's every chance we'll sell out seeds again in the next year.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","Yeah. Good morning. I just wanted to delve a little bit deeper into your precision Ag platform, and I know it's not really going to be a near-term growth driver, but if you could give us some sort of color in terms of how you plan to grow that business and any maybe sort of updates in terms of how you're thinking about pricing it specifically if you bundle, let's say, some of the FieldScripts products with some of the Climate Corp. products. Thanks.","Hugh Grant","Yeah. I'll maybe -- I'll ask Brett to say a little bit on pricing. And I would think -- I'd think of this going forward as this is an integrating platform that brings a range of trade partners together and brings a range of technologies and applications together.","This year we've really focused on good grower experiences. This is a little bit like a groundbreaker year for us, and Brett said that we are on 20 million plus acres with Climate Basic, and we are on hundreds of thousands of acres with Climate Pro, which is the paying version of this technology. But Brett maybe -- so we're really pleased with the starting year, I think it's going really well, but maybe a little help -- word, Brett, on how you see it playing out.","Brett D. Begemann","Yeah, thanks. I look at it as the 20 million plus acres of Climate Basic as a really strong indicator that farmers are really, really interested in this space, and looking for someone to help them improve decision making with better science. Granted there's no charge for Climate Basic, but to get on the system you have to go online and enter your information to be a part of that. So interest is high.","Second piece of that is as we've stated that the early days of the purchase of Climate; we're seeing the power of being able to bring together their competencies around weather and hyper Doppler radar, etcetera, with the power we have of our own genomics engines and breeding systems here to create better recommendations going into the marketplace.","And I think that's what you start to see that come together in the FieldScripts products that we put into the marketplace that are paid acres, and then as well the Climate Pro acres that are also paid acres. And there is synergistic effect.","I mean if I was to suggest to a grower the optimum process is to be utilizing the FieldScripts engine to make a choice on genetics, based on field history, etcetera, as well as Climate Pro to help the farmer make the very best decisions on how to grow that crop throughout the year. So they definitely play off of each other, and that's why we talk about them as a family of products. And for the farmer that wants to optimize as far as he can go, it's using that suite of products all the way across the portfolio.","That being said, each one of the individual products will be able to be bought separately. They won't have to be integrated. So the farmer will have significant choice. But as we see it, there will be -- there always be the basic products out there just to help the farmer collect information and knowledge, but then the paid acres is where we'll be focused. And this year we'll have a really good testing in the field with the Climate Pro as well as the IFS acres to take a look at.","Bryan Hurley","Rob, I think we can go onto the next question.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Michael Cox of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On Intacta I was wondering if you could comment whether you plan to renew or re-up the rebate or the discounts that you offered this past season. And then secondarily on Intacta, any potential risk or issue to getting farmers in Brazil to pay for the technology?","Hugh Grant","So thanks for the two questions. I'll let Brett talk about rebates and discounts. My experience -- my experience this year that the grower feedback has been phenomenal, yields have been very, very strong from what we've -- we're halfway through capturing yield.","The first half looks really strong and I think given our performance and grower feedback, I'm optimistic in our ability to capture that premium performance and growers so far have been very encouraging and have stepped up in terms of paying for that premium. So I don't have any worries there. Then the other piece Brett on discounting.","Brett Begemann","Yeah. On the discounting, let's to be really clear on that, the discounting was associated with giving up on the Roundup Ready 1 lawsuits etcetera. So farmers that haven\u2019t done that yet, will still have the opportunity to sign up for that and receive that discount on Intacta to make that happen and we'll continue that next year.","But that's where the discounting was -- but on the getting paid, nothing better than having a great product performance year to show the farmer the value is really there and it changes that conversation quickly.","Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray","Yeah. Okay. And if I could ask one quick question on IFS, you've offered some money back guarantee offering to spur adoption. I was wondering if you could just comment on the success of those types of offerings and how they contributed to the receptivity.","Brett D. Begemann","Yeah. The money-back guarantee is on Climate Pro. So the farmer can buy Climate Pro this year with a money back guarantee in the fall. And it's exactly what you said. We want to encourage as many farmers as possible to sign up for Climate Pro and try the tools.","This is something really different. It's really new. And the best way to show a farmer the value is have them use the product, not unlike some of our early trait products that were new and different, same kind of thing.","Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","All right. Thank you. You -- just on U.S. market share looks like in corn given lower acres and your forecasted higher volumes, you can grow share maybe by 1%. But in soybeans given the higher acreage, can you still grow share in soybeans you think this year?","Hugh Grant","So I -- call me traditional, but I would kind of like to get a crop planted before we start talking about -- we always start talking about shares. So we're feeling good with the product performance both in our corn business and in beans.","And as Brett made the point earlier, the bean story is north and southern hemisphere. And I think there's opportunities for share growth in both, but before getting too granular, I'd like to get the spring down and get some crop in the ground.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And can you just remind us of the trade-off between corn and bean acres. It used to be about $0.02 to $0.03 for every million acres. Is that still the good rule of thumb?","Hugh Grant","Yes. A good rule of thumb; that would be about right.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Yes, hi. Good morning. In Seeds and Genomics, your gross margins were up 230 basis points, roughly. How much of the benefit gained from lower seed costs, which I know was going to be a benefit in 2014? And then we know the DuPont royalties was also a benefit. But can you specifically talk about lower seed costs?","Pierre Courduroux","So the lower seed cost P.J. mostly impacts our corn business. And at this point in time, I mean would be a slightly lower than the two points we are shooting for the full season. We will see the second part of that benefit from COGS in Q3 and Q4 as we mentioned. So we are still shooting for the three points total of which two coming from COGS when you looking at the corn business.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Thank you. And Brett, did you say you expect glyphosate gross profit to be flat in 2014 versus 2013? I think that was your previous prediction. Are you sticking to that?","Brett D. Begemann","Yeah. I think P.J. what we've been saying is we expected glyphosate gross profit to be steady to stronger and today I pointed to the stronger end of that. And that's kind of how we see it finishing for the year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","And do you sort of care to quantify that. Thank you.","Brett D. Begemann","Quatify what's stronger?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Yeah.","Bryan Hurley","If you -- this is Bryan Hurley. If you kind of look at quantifying that from a relative perspective, you obviously saw a big step up in glyphosate last year -- in the Ag productivity segment last year. You'd expect some degree of step-up, but nothing on the magnitude of what you saw last year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Thank you.","Bryan Hurley","With that, I think we're probably ready for our next question.","Operator","Yes. The next question is from the line of Mark Gulley of BGC Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","Hey. good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","I wanted to ask you guys to elaborate a little bit on insect pressure in South America. Of course you alluded to the soy insect pressure, but then you talked a little bit about corn. Can you elaborate on how that might affect adoption of insect traits in both Argentina and Brazil?","Hugh Grant","Yeah. I think what you see in south America is already to this point in corn insect traits have been adopted at a very fast rate. And you see that with the transition we're going through now to Triple Pro in Argentina and to the second generation in Brazil.","You have a longer growing season. You have more above ground pest. So you have a lot more insect pressure across South America than we experienced in North America. And that drives the desire from the farmer standpoint to have more insect control in the field for the longer season.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","And I think this year and certainly beans, it was particularly high.","Hugh Grant","It was high in beans this year and a new pest showing up in Brazil, another caterpillar pest that hasn\u2019t been that prevalent before and it's showing up lot stronger.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","And secondly is my follow-up financial question. Congratulations on the 2% share count shrinkage on the diluted line year over year in the second quarter. Can you give us an idea, or update us perhaps, on your share repurchase goals in the second half of this year and perhaps even looking ahead to next year?","Pierre Courduroux","So we've not been specific about the magnitude and the details of our plans but what we said is that this year we will be returning more to our share owners than our free cash. And we indicated when we made the Climate Corporate acquisition that I mean we were taking the opportunity of borrowing about $1 billion to finance this acquisition to free up some money available for share buyback.","So we are very active. I think, we've been very active over the last couple of quarters. And as you mentioned, we've been able to reduce our share counts. And that's a goal. I mean we'll try to be very thoughtful about how we do that, but that's definitely a goal of ours.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","Thank you.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Hi. good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","A quarter ago, you were conservative about glyphosate prices. You thought that Chinese prices had come down and maybe that would affect the North America market. Has that proven to be the case? That is, have your glyphosate prices changed at all sequentially? And do you expect it to change at all for this fiscal year?","Hugh Grant","Yeah. I'll ask Brett say a few words on that. I think Jeff, the way I'd characterize it is it's within the bounds of what we forecasted and anticipated this year. And I think if you (indiscernible) in the glyphosate piece, then you run the4 risk of losing the -- losing sight of the seeds and trait growth.","And the thing I'm particularly pleased on this year, first half behind us looking at the second half is we demonstrated margin less than we demonstrate nice growth in our seeds and traits. But Brett, maybe a word on how the season is shaping out and the visibility around that.","Brett D. Begemann","Yeah. If you go back to last quarter, Chinese prices were fluctuating downward. And that's why we pointed a little bit to the caution. I mentioned that we really don't focus on Chinese prices. We focus on generic prices in the marketplace, and which never did materialize at a lower level based on the Chinese price state.","They held we held therefore, as I look at it today, you can see four, five months out in advance of where we are I expect flattish prices for the rest of the year, which to Hugh's point is right in the range of what we were expecting. And that's what puts us to the stronger end of flat to stronger GP from glyphosate.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Have you sold about 60% of all the glyphosate you intend to sell this year in the first two quarters?","Brett D. Begemann","We don't break out the specific volume by quarter, but the\u2026","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","How about by half?","Brett D. Begemann","I would tell you at this point that I see no material change in the shipping or buying pattern of Roundup across the year. So we're -- there's nothing different than what we have historically experienced.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Brett D. Begemann","No. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA","Thank you. Hugh, I wonder if we could talk a little bit about farmers' attitudes. In New York, the view seems to be that farmers are all incredibly bearish about the outlook, that they think corn prices are headed to zero and they are not willing to pay anything in the U.S. for corn and seed.","On the other hand, you mentioned that corn futures have hit $5. So I'm wondering how do you think farmers are actually looking at this -- at the outlook here? Are they really as bearish as people make them out to be?","Hugh Grant","Yeah. Thanks for the question. You know the old story is never as bad as it seems, it's never as good as they tell you. I think we never took $8 corn very, very seriously. And I think this doom and gloom you have to be cautious, you have to predicate that with caution, but I think there is still a tremendous opportunity out there.","I think farmers are being more careful and rightfully. So they are taking a little bit longer this year. The season is probably going to run a little bit late. Our attitude here is we are trying to look through any given season, take the longer view, we've been careful and our pricing, we've rebuild our reputation in that grower community. And I think as we mentioned this morning, we feel good about the season at hand and we're getting good encouragement from our grower customers.","So I'm \u2013 maybe I'm the optimistic scores man, but I think there's more opportunity there and I think we are seeing the reward and the order book and how farmers are looking. But I think it's -- we mentioned at the start, acres are a little bit softer and $5 corn is still pretty good, but it's something to watch. So Mark, I would say, we are cautiously optimistic.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA","And what about Brazil then? Certainly the real is not helping. And as I look at your slide 13, I wonder whether weaker yields in Brazil are making this 4 bushel an acre as good a test as you would have wanted. Is next year going to be a better comparison for Intacta if the weather is more normal?","Hugh Grant","No. I think this was a great test this year. So A, it was across a wide user-ship. B, we had intense insect pressure. And C, bean prices are pretty strong. So I would say that this was a really, really great test for the technology this year.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Two-part question on Intacta. First, would you expect to launch in Argentina and other South American countries outside of Brazil next year?","And then second part, I believe you have second-generation insect protected beans in Phase IV. What are the chances that could come to market next year or might it require more patience?","Hugh Grant","Yes. So, Brett, launch next year in Argentina?","Brett D. Begemann","So, we have -- as we have mentioned before, there's a few trial acres in the northern part of Argentina this year. And we've said that they are about a year behind Brazil, so we would intend to be commercial in parts of Argentina next year.","There will also be some varieties that we will be marketing in Paraguay and Uruguay. So, next year really puts us fully into the South American market. As we look at the second-generation of Intacta, it's not quite that close to the marketplace.","We'd be looking to the latter end of the decade before we would have the second-generation out there. We're super excited about it. It's fantastic that we already got it in the portfolio as we're launching the first product, but it will be towards the latter part of the decade.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","As a brief follow-up on Ukraine, Brett, I think you mentioned some degree of disruption there. It didn't sound terribly significant. But in your scenario analysis and planning, can you speak to direct effects and possibly indirect benefits if tensions were to intensify in that country?","Brett D. Begemann","Yeah. It's difficult to speculate on what could happen over there, because it can change overnight. But I would tell you that there is -- the two breakouts I'd make for you is. There is the larger farming operations that are over there that are well capitalized and feel good about their business.","Then you have the smaller farmers in the country that rely more on credit from retailers, et cetera. The smaller ones are impacted more than the large ones. If the disruption was to intensify, I would expect the disruption to intensify more for the smaller ones than the large ones, which gives us the cautious optimism that we can work our way through this for the year. I'd never suggest there's no impact. It's just a manageable impact as we go through the year.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Advisors. Please go with your question.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hey, on your soybean business, obviously you had record profits, year over year up $140 million plus on the gross profit line. And I think you attributed it to three major categories; Intacta launch, the royalties, and general gains in the U.S. How would you apportion roughly that year-over-year increase among those three major buckets?","Pierre Courduroux","So, we've not quantified it in detail. I mean we've given some indication. I think the key points are -- I mean we're online with -- we were on track with what we said we would be doing. So, Intacta we have been able to launch on the 3 million acres we've been talking about. The DuPont royalty I think you can get pretty easily to the number there.","And maybe the part that most people have been missing is actually really the very strong performance of our U.S. business, our Roundup Ready 2 Yield business in the U.S., which would be very consistent actually with some of the acreage shift we've been talking about.","So, it wouldn't be exactly a third, a third, a third, but the three are significant impacts into the performance of our soybeans business. And what you can see is definitely plays out a big role in the GP, but also the margin expansion.","Hugh Grant","And Frank if you look how -- if you look at the next two or three years, what we're just on the very front end of very significant, very fast growth in Intacta. So, you're right it's a three-legged stool this year, but as you go out over the next 24 to 36 months, then Intacta becomes a major driver in the soybean franchise.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","All right, terrific. And then you'd anticipate, with the gains in RR2Y in the U.S., that Q3 is shaping up nicely there as well in soybeans?","Pierre Courduroux","So, once again, it will all depend on the planning and the shift in the final acres, but -- I mean we think we're extremely well-positioned in terms of sellouts regarding our soybeans business, absolutely.","Brett Begemann","Yeah. You will see really the second big increment of all of those factors that you mentioned show in the fourth quarter for soybeans. You'll have that second DuPont royalty and you'll actually start seeing Intacta sales for the next season showing up in the fourth quarter as well.","With that, we probably have recognized that we're running just a bit long on time. Why don't we take two more questions and then Mr. Grant will wrap things up?","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Roberts - UBS","Can you hear me?","Hugh Grant","Yeah, we can hear you John.","John Roberts - UBS","Hugh, of the 9 billion in additional corn required over the next cycle here, how much would you say is going to be international? How much would be U.S.? And would you hazard a guess of the split from Monsanto?","Hugh Grant","I missed the start of your question, John. The nine --?","John Roberts - UBS","9 billion bushels of additional corn demand.","Hugh Grant","I'm sorry, I got you. The split, it's nearer about 6 billion. I'm looking around the table here.","John Roberts - UBS","Slide six with the 9 billion bushels of growth in demand for corn.","Hugh Grant","I think we would say somewhere between 6 billion to 9 billion. Is that right?","Pierre Courduroux","Yeah.","John Roberts - UBS","And then how much would be -- would you guess is going to be North American yield growth and how much would be international growth, both yield and acres I guess?","Brett Begemann","I think the way you look at it is the vast majority of the growth coming out of North America to meet that 9 billion bushel demand is going to have to be intensification on the acres that are already there. As we have the acre discussion every year, is it 95 million, is it 91 million, who knows? It's mostly intensification.","We have the opportunity to expand a little bit more in Eastern Europe and possibly Brazil with acres, but the vast majority, as we look at the next 10 years, is going to have to come from intensification because we're also getting demand pressure on soybeans and other crops. So, we can't keep trading off the acres and still meet it.","And a lot of what has happened in the previous 10 years is wheat acres becoming corn acres because a farmer can be more profitable and you run out of that at some point. There's still some in Canada. There's still some in northern Eastern Europe, but we're running out of those.","So, we're going to have to see the intensification, sustainable intensification on the acres that were already growing corn. So, most of it will come around the world, every acre is going to have to contribute.","Hugh Grant","So, John the consensus here is 30% to 40% of that growth comes from North America.","John Roberts - UBS","Okay.","Hugh Grant","But to Brett's point, the last 10 years we've seen a huge piece of that growth come from brand new acres. The next 10 years our guess is the lion's share of this comes through intensification and that was my point on sustainable intensification is how you make those acres work harder.","John Roberts - UBS","And 60% to 70% would come from ex-U.S.?","Hugh Grant","That's correct.","John Roberts - UBS","Would it be a higher increment from Monsanto?","Hugh Grant","Well, the yields -- they've got further to go because the yields drag behind the U.S. today. So, there's a greater opportunity in total production there because if you look at Brazil, India, Eastern Europe today those acres are less productive than North American acres.","John Roberts - UBS","I'll take it offline. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Tiberio of Miller Tabak. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Tiberio - Miller, Tabak + Co., LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking my time. I guess just following up the last question. We've seen some reports out of India that indicates they may be softening their stance towards GMO seeds for food crops.","Are you becoming more confident in that market than where we were over the last two years? Or do you think it's still too premature to really start thinking about this as part of the component of the incremental volumes or yield gains that we will need to see?","Hugh Grant","Yeah, I think it's maybe a little premature. I mean they made an early move and a very significant move in cotton, but they haven't done a lot since then. There's a real opportunity there. And if you look at India and protein consumption in India, rice acres are decreasing, water is becoming scarce, and corn -- particularly corn growth for poultry feed has increased significantly. So, I think there's a real opportunity there going forward, but I think probably premature to guess on it today.","Tim Tiberio - Miller, Tabak + Co., LLC","Okay. So you don't put a lot of weight that the BGP, if they get into power, may soften that stance? It seemed like some of the recent court rulings are at least green-lighting some of the initial field drills.","Hugh Grant","Some of the signs are encouraging, but I think it's a dangerous game when you start trying to second guess regulatory bodies. I think there's a need -- there's a lot of grower experience and there's a real opportunity, but the encouraging piece is the continued rise in protein demand. And it kind of ties to John Roberts' question, this is going to come through intensification of producing more bushels on an acre, but when that occurs I wouldn't like to speculate.","I'm just very conscious of your time, so I'll maybe transition. Thank you for your patience. I apologize for the 10 minutes we're over. And I'd just wrap up the call this morning by thanking you for joining us at this juncture.","Q2, as I mentioned at the beginning, we still have the North American and European seasons, West and East to play out. There's a couple of critical proof points that I think are punctuated by our performance that we discussed this morning.","I'm very encouraged because we've been able to demonstrate solid growth in our seeds and traits against a backdrop of a tougher ag environment than we've seen probably over the past few years.","With that we're on track to deliver the growth that we anticipated for the full year, even given a more variable external atmosphere. And with what we accomplish in 2014, I think we set up an important runway that allows us to grow now while we simultaneously position ourselves for an important longer-term environment as well. So, nice growth in our core and in our new platforms.","So, we're focused on delivering that opportunity and we look forward to continuing to share that with you and update you on our progress. So thanks, again, for joining us this morning.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, you may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Priyal Patel, Ben Kampelman, and Christa Chancellor.","Our fourth-quarter call marks the close of the fiscal year, and importantly provides our initial outlook into the operational plans and financial guidance for fiscal year 2017. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides, and the replay at Monsanto.com.","We have provided you with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the Company\u2019s actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today\u2019s press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the Company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","First, let me review our year-end results as shown on Slide 6 and 7. We delivered as reported full-year earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting $0.56 of expense for Argentine-related tax matters, $0.59 for restructuring charges, $0.38 of expense for environmental and litigation matters, and $0.04 of income from discontinued operations.","On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $4.48 for fiscal year 2016, slightly above our most recent guidance for the year. And finally, our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $1.7 billion and exceeded the high end of our guidance range due to a strong start for the South American season.","With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. I\u2019d like to begin this morning with our agreement to combine with Bayer in this new era for agriculture. Our Board of Directors underwent a comprehensive evaluation process and assessed a broad range of strategic options and opportunities.","We unanimously determined that our combination with Bayer represents the most compelling value for our shareowners with the most certainty through the all-cash consideration. ","So with this agreement as the backdrop, our two priorities going forward are as follows: First, delivering on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones; and second, executing on the necessary steps to close the deal which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017. ","To be clear, our long-term growth plan and our pipeline remain intact and consistent with what we shared at our Whistle Stop Investor event in mid-August. However, we recognize that what matters most to our owners now is delivering 2017 and closing the deal, so that will be our focus for the year ahead and in these updates to you.","This deal was struck because the overarching need to deliver innovation to growers continues as demand continues to climb. I know that that may seem incongruent, especially when corn is below $4 a bushel and soybeans are below $10. However, the most recent WASDE Report demonstrated that the demand trend remains both intact and robust. ","In fact, as seen on Slide 8, the trend line is more than 1 billion bushels of growth a year for corn and greater than 500 million bushels of growth a year for soybeans, which is consistent with the historical growth trends. ","Meeting that demand over the next decade would require a two-fold increase in the rate of yield growth for corn and a four-fold increase for soybeans. Innovation, quite simply, is the best way to increase productivity to meet this projected demand. ","And our unique platform advantages provide this innovation as shown on Slide 9. It all starts with our industry-leading Seed and Trait technologies which reach approximately 400 million acres today as a result of strong grower demand and our historical broad licensing approach.","This footprint serves as the foundation for future upgrades and new technologies, which includes the global annual corn germplasm upgrade, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO, the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, and finally our unique Climate FieldView platform.","This platform has become the digital Ag standard for growers large and small with its reach now on 95 million acres. To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we recently expanded our capabilities in genome editing. ","In addition to those with TargetGene and Nomad, we now have agreements in place with Dow AgroSciences and the Broad Institute to further unlock technological capabilities in this rapidly expanding area of science. ","Further, these unique innovation platforms are highly complementary to Bayer\u2019s crop protection business. As you know, at Monsanto, we\u2019ve discussed the value of an enhanced agricultural portfolio for a long time. We\u2019re entering a new era in agriculture, one in which growers are demanding new solutions and technologies to be more profitable and more sustainable. ","By pairing Bayer\u2019s exceptional crop protection portfolio with our Seeds and Traits and Climate FieldView platform, we expect to accelerate the rate and the delivery of advancements that will make a real difference on the farm. ","To get there from here, we need to close the deal and we are confident on our path to do so. This confidence stems from the following points. First, these are two different, but complementary businesses that we are proposing to combine with limited overlap in products and in geographies. ","Second, we have a long history of making our technologies widely accessible through licensing and open infrastructure, and Bayer has indicated that they are committed to continuing that practice. And third, Bayer has backed up this confidence with a $2 billion reverse breakup fee. ","Our early outreach to various stakeholders and the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing led by Senator Grassley bolsters this confidence as there is an indication of a broader understanding of the factors and the regulatory process. ","Moving to Slide 10, we\u2019ve provided our anticipated timeline for the transaction and we look forward to updating you on the status as we move forward. Until then, we are committed to operate as an independent company and we are focused fully on the year ahead. With strong demand for new soybean technologies and improved cost of goods, we expect to return to growth in our ongoing earnings per share in fiscal year 2017, anticipating up to 9% growth year-over-year. ","So with those brief headlines, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support our outlook. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning everyone. Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it\u2019s important to put 2016 in context. No doubt it was a challenging year, but despite those challenges, we stayed the course on several key deliverables, including outstanding penetration of our Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology, the launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend Soybeans, our continued global corn germplasm upgrade which resulted in record corn seed volumes in the US, and our disciplined spend management. ","Executing these deliverables provides the base for growth positioning us well for long-term earnings power, and I\u2019ll spend my time today outlining the growth drivers for our fiscal year 2017 operational plan. ","Let\u2019s begin with corn on Slide 11. At a high level, we expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, share gains, and continued momentum in South America. When we take a closer look, we see greater than 25% acre growth in Argentina, strong price increases planned across South America, and an expected strong season in South Africa. In the US, we have plans in place to grow genetic share yet again and we\u2019ve priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly and our new hybrids at a premium. ","This maintains our premium pricing, which reflects our higher performing portfolio; and all of this together -- add all of this together and we expect; first, our global corn germplasm price mix lifting in local currency will be roughly flat-to-up, low-single digits in terms of percentages. ","And second, we plan to grow our global corn germplasm footprint in an environment where global corn acres are expected to be roughly flat. In soybeans in 2017, we expect to reach several significant milestones as shown on Slide 12 and deliver improved margins as well as greater than 20% growth in global soybean gross profit compared to 2016.","For Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO, we plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres in South America as shown on Slide 13. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil; and with continued progress toward maintaining reliable value capture in Argentina, we are optimistic about that country\u2019s contribution to that overall total. ","Let\u2019s move from a product with an opportunity on 100 million acres to the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System opportunity that more than doubles that figure as shown on Slide 14. ","We now expect supply for more than 15 million US acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend Soybeans, with key import approvals now in hand and the expected approval for the end-crop use of Dicamba on the horizon from the EPA, we expect Xtend-related COGS to decline significantly year-over-year. ","In addition, we have priced Roundup Ready 2 Xtend Soybean varieties at a $5 to $10 premium for the improved genetics and weed control flexibility and demand for the technology is high. Also, we recently shared that Syngenta is a new licensee of the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend trait. ","With this addition, the number of seed partners offering this new option has a footprint on more than 90% of the acres in the US. ","Moving to our complementary crops, the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System story continues. We expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton area will exceed three million acres in 2017, and we expect those traited acres to generate a premium for the weed control benefit they provide. ","We also see 2017 as the third consecutive year of share growth. Between our branded and license to cotton business in the US, we have grown by more than eight share points in the last year and I expect share growth again for this year. ","Moving to Ag productivity, we plan to maintain our emphasis on cost discipline and focus on the construction of our new Dicamba facility while launching some of our new formulations of Dicamba. We also plan to remain consistent with our strategy to price just above generics with our high-volume, glyphosate-based herbicide portfolio, and this is expected to create another year of pricing headwinds. ","Longer-term, our plans are to add new Dicamba formulations as well as new molecules like the new PPO weed control technology we are developing with Sumitomo. ","And finally, the platform that serves as the technology integrator, Climate FieldView as shown on Slide 15 continues to see major advancements as the business and platform continues to evolve. ","We just released four new product enhancements for 2017 that will give growers better insight into their farms to help manage field variability and analyze seed performance in ways they\u2019ve never had before. ","We expect these upgrades to help drive paid acres and our goal for the year ahead is to hit 25 million paid acres. We have also made progress with partnerships and collaborations in the industry to continue connecting fields and decision points faced by our customers. We have six total retail partners and our FieldView drive now works on most tractors and more than half of the combines in the US. ","In fiscal year 2016, we exceeded our objective with greater than 14 million paid acres. In fiscal year 2017, we are off to a strong start with FieldView drive sales which ramped up since farm progress and provided an additional 5 million paid acres accelerating us toward our objective of 25 million paid acres. ","In addition to equipment and retail linkages, we are also attracting new platform partners such as Veris Technologies, which manufactures and markets the world\u2019s first high-resolution soil sensing technology. ","Climate can now begin to analyze this data in conjunction with other information to help growers and their trusted advisors make more informed decisions on how to optimize productivity on their farm, and we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux ","Thanks Brett, and good morning to everyone. In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation were key to delivering 2016, and I am proud of what we accomplished. ","First, we successfully delivered on our restructuring and cost saving plan targets of $165 million. Second, we maintained our premium pricing approach and inked several new strategic licensing agreements. ","Those two examples demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver return on innovation. And third, we concluded our capital allocation commitments returning more than $40 billion [ph] in cash to our owners over the past three years through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. ","In the fourth quarter, we closed out the year with an as-reported loss of $0.44 per share and delivered ongoing earnings per share of $0.07. The primary difference between the as-reported loss and the ongoing earnings per share was related to approximately $280 million in litigation settlement costs associated with a group of legacy PCB personal injury claim.","In September, after diligent efforts, we were pleased to reach an agreement to potentially settle all the legacy PCB personal injury claims including those on appeal. The settlement and final payment amounts will be contingent upon the level of claimant participation which we anticipate will be met at a very high level.","In September, after diligent efforts, we were pleased to reach an agreement to potentially settle all the legacy PCB personal injury claims including those on appeal. The settlement and final payment amounts will be contingent upon the level of claimant participation which we anticipate will be met at a very high level. ","In addition to the settlement expense, we incurred some additional restructuring costs and trued up our overall restructuring plan cost estimate which we now expect to be lower and in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the entire plan. ","The ongoing results of $0.07 for the quarter were better than last year driven by the previously discussed $157 million gain from the formation of the sorghum joint venture with Remington, a strong start in South America reflecting stronger corn acres, as well as slower seed returns in the U.S. in both corn and soybeans. ","The positive earnings results in the fourth quarter along with strong preface for Intacta in Brazil translated to better than expected free cash flows. ","Moving to the full year results, on an as reported basis, we delivered earnings per share of $2.99 reflecting cost associated with our restructuring actions, Argentine-related tax matters, environmental and litigation matters and income from discontinued ops. ","On an ongoing basis, this translated to EPS of $4.48, slightly above our most recent guidance and stronger than expected free cash flows of $1.7 billion which was $100 million above the high end of our guidance range. ","Continued focus on innovation and cost discipline, set up a strong base for 2017 where we are expecting a return to gross profit growth in our seeds and genomics segments driven by our soybean blockbusters and improved cost of goods sold. ","On an as reported basis, and as shown in our reconciliation, we expect our EPS to be in the range of $3.83 to $4.35 with proposed Bayer transaction-related costs, anticipated restructuring charges and continued Argentine-related tax matters expense as the primary drivers of the difference from our ongoing estimate. ","Our fiscal year 2017 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90 as shown on Slide 16. This translates into up to 9% growth in our ongoing earnings per share year-over-year and strong free cash flows. ","Within this estimate, we have assumed that currencies are relatively stable year-over-year. Our seeds and genomics segment gross profit is expected to increase mid single-digits as a percent of year-over-year with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%. ","This is driven primarily by the expected increases in Intacta and Xtend Soybean penetration and related trait fees, plus a significant expected reduction in the cost of goods sold. In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains from the annual germplasm refresh and germplasm price mix lift in local currency. ","However, we are prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics in fiscal year 2017. From a strategic licensing perspective we are expecting the benefit to decline in this segment with an expectation of approximately $60 million in gross profit towards the end of the fiscal year. ","Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides, primarily affecting the first half comparisons. ","In addition, we expect the contribution of approximately $140 million in strategic deal opportunities in this segment\u2019s gross profit in the latter half of the year, pending the final deal structures. ","We also expect to see the early contributions from sales of the dicamba-based herbicides that Brett referenced and some expenses associated with the construction of the dicamba facility in this segment as well. ","Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives are on track as shown on Slide 17 with the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings at the close of 2017 in operating expenses and cost of goods as compared to fiscal year 2015. ","However, overall operating expenses in 2017 are expected to increase slightly with inflation and the cost associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting the savings from restructuring and cost savings initiatives. ","Finally, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%. ","Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we expect to effectively convert our anticipated earnings into cash with free cash flow expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This consists of operating cash flows in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion while cash used for investing activities is expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion assuming the successful sale of our precision ag equipment business and our first year of meaningful investment in the dicamba production facility.","In closing, these plans, with our focus on return on innovation and financial discipline builds a solid foundation for growth as shown on Slide 18 and underpin our integrated solution strategy and vision for agriculture. ","With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks, Pierre. We\u2019d now like to open the call for approximately 20 minutes of questions. As we typically do, I\u2019ll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person, so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You\u2019re always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up. Christine, we are ready to take questions from the line. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. Hugh, I want to go back to some of your comments on the Bayer transaction. You\u2019ve got a $128 firm bid with your stocks trading at $102, so there seems to be some concern over antitrust risks. You mentioned the reasons why you don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a big issue. ","But the regulators have said they are going to evaluate this transaction but also not just going to sell merits but in light of the other two major transactions that are out there. So, how do you assess that risk from an antitrust standpoint?","Hugh Grant","Yes, Don, thanks for your question this morning. I\u2019d go back to my opening remarks. The unique thing about this transaction is there is very little overlap. So you\u2019re bringing together a seed business and a crop protection business and I think we can bring these two businesses together with much better insight for the grower by using digital agriculture.","So, I can\u2019t speculate on regulators or opine on how regulators are going to view this. I think it\u2019s a really unique combination and the focus on this will be driving the innovation curve. So producing better products faster and as we embark in that conversation with regulators we will be stressing that innovation curve and that was certainly emphasized in the hearings with the Senator Grassley hosted a few weeks ago when Rob had a chance to talk about innovation. ","I guess, the last thing I talk about, when we IPO\u2019d this business 15 plus years ago we were spending about $300 million in innovation and this year we will be northwards around $1.5 billion and I think that the combination going forward allows us to more efficiently drive R&D and get to those much needed solution. ","So, that will be the conversation when we get in front of the regulators, but the irony, Don, is in a tough time in agriculture that\u2019s never been a greater need for innovation and those seem to be at odds, but that\u2019s the reality of the marketplace we\u2019re in. ","Don Carson","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks for your question. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. ","PJ Juvekar ","Yes, thank you. Good morning. ","Hugh Grant","Good morning, PJ.","PJ Juvekar ","I am looking at your comments about your price cards, it could be somewhat flat it looks like. Your major competitor is also saying their price cards are flat, but we know that most of the competitive pressures occur at the end of the season, maybe in January and February. So, what are your expectations with realized prices in seeds? How realistic are they in light of what happened last year? ","Hugh Grant","Yes, PJ, thanks. I\u2019ll maybe ask Brett say a few words, but the sequence as we price in late summer, we truck in early fall. We start trucking and logistically shifting seed that\u2019s planted in the spring of 2017, but Brett, feedback on price cards and how you see it playing out?","Brett Begemann","Yes, thanks, PJ. Good morning. I think a couple of things. So first of all, the idea that we are pricing most of our portfolio relatively flat to down a little bit is very consistent with our overall pricing strategy that we typically use as we put new products in the marketplace and just like in other years our new better performing products that went out this year are priced at a premium and that premium is based on the value that they bring to the farmer better than the products that are already there. ","Commodity price, obviously is part of that equation that we do that calculation. So that premium is a little bit less than it would be in years where you have higher commodity prices but if they are still bringing significant value, and I think what that does is it holds in place, our portfolio being priced above others in the marketplace which we fully expect. ","We don\u2019t anticipate to match up with everybody else\u2019s price card. We expect to be at a premium. I would suggest that some of the shenanigans if you want to call on that that happened late in the year are ineffective for everybody. Farmers are making their decisions now, as they\u2019re running their combines. They\u2018re looking at harvest. They\u2019re working with their seed reps, making a decision on what they are going to plant and the biggest driver on that decision as it always is, is going to be performance. ","How are the products performing in the field and we\u2019ll continue to have that conversation with our farmers, but we will be on the ready if we something develops in the market to compete. ","PJ Juvekar ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Christopher Parkinson ","Hey guys. How are you doing? ","Hugh Grant","Good morning, Chris. ","Christopher Parkinson ","Can you just talk a little bit more about the longer-term trends in seeding populations in both the U.S. and even Brazil longer term and how this translates into your own expectations netting out acreage trends going forward? Do you just generally believe this is a longer-term trend and also how does this translate into the competitive environment given the technological differences amongst your germplasm portfolio versus others? Thank you.","Brett Begemann","Chris, thanks for the question. As you kind of hinted at, this is a trend that\u2019s increasing. We breed towards that so as we are looking at new varieties we\u2019re breeding for varieties, thrive in higher density populations and then I think the developments with climate and digital agriculture allow us to vary that plant population across a field. ","But if you look right now, this coming year or the near-term, how is it shaping up. If you look at the year we just finished in 2016 and the year we are going into in 2017, you can clearly see the trend continuing across corn particularly in North America where planting populations are increasing a bit and it\u2019s exactly what Hugh was describing. That\u2019s part of how you drive yield as increasing of plants in the field. ","You just have to have genetics that work in that environment. That\u2019s starting to happen in South America not to the extent that it has in North America. My anticipation is, is tools like Climate are going to help dramatically in South America to help the farmer better understand the value of increasing seeding populations because it\u2019s counterintuitive sometimes when they\u2019re stressed on commodity price and profitability, they look at seed and they want to back off, but that\u2019s the worst thing that they can do. ","Now I will tell you some of the data we\u2019ll show you in soybeans that there are \u2013 there maybe opportunities in some varieties they are being overplanted. So, again, I think that\u2019s the beauty of the analytical tools that we are developing in climate. It isn\u2019t always to sell the farmer more, it\u2019s to optimize the decisions that they are making to increase the profitability on the farm. And I think that sometimes it\u2019s misunderstood, it\u2019s all about helping on make a better decision. ","Christopher Parkinson ","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. ","Hugh Grant","Good morning. ","David Begleiter","Hugh and Pierre, can you talk about tailwinds in 2017 from lower COGS and lower Xtend launch costs?","Pierre Courduroux","Sure, so, when we\u2019re looking into 2017, I mean, we see definitely a return to growth in our Seed and Trait business and actually just stepping back into 2016, and Brett partly covered that, but when you look at 2016, if you just look at corn and soybeans, if you exclude the impact of currency, extremely challenging environment. We\u2019ve been able to grow gross profit in both segments in corn and soybeans if you exclude the currency. ","So there is some really nice momentum that\u2019s been building and I think our corn business has shown some very nice resilience there. If you assume entering into 2017, more stable currencies, we are confident this is a business that\u2019s going to be growing in 2017. And two of the elements you mentioned are related to the tailwinds are effectively going to help us continue to grow, but it\u2019s really the dynamics of our two blockbusters in soybeans Xtend and Intacta, now that the bases have been set and in corn this is \u2013 as Brett was mentioning, this ability to continue to have some level of germplasm mix lift and some level of share gains. ","Now, regarding the tailwinds, we see fairly significant tailwinds in terms of cost of goods when it comes to Xtend as you mentioned. So, we quoted about $150 million of headwinds this year and we said about two-thirds of those we will be able to recover next year and this is still absolutely valid. ","In terms of corn, we will see the tailwind associated with more production and that\u2019s as we mentioned. However, in corn, we are also seeing some higher costs in Brazil related to commodity price currency and a couple of our elements and we are also upgrading our seed treatments across the board on our corn cost of goods. So we\u2019re not going to see as much the tailwind as we were expecting definitely in the corn business, but in soybeans, the Xtend-related costs are definitely going to show up. ","David Begleiter","And Pierre, can you discuss the cadence of earnings in 2017 in particular, do you expect to lose money in Q1?","Pierre Courduroux","So, we have not been looking at the details of our quarters in terms of our prepared remarks. However, when you look at Q1, the way we are thinking about Q1 is that, it should be similar to slightly better than what we saw last year. ","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. ","Steve Byrne ","Yes, thank you. Given the new seed law in Argentina has not yet been promulgated, are you guys selling the Xtend Soybean down in that region for the upcoming growing season and what do you think of the draft language in that law that specifies a maximum of three years of royalties payable by the growers. What do you think of that?","Hugh Grant","Steve, thanks for the question. We\u2019ve obviously been involved in these discussions, Brett, maybe just some headlines. ","Brett Begemann","Yes, good morning Steve. I think as \u2013 let\u2019s start with the seed law and then where we go from there. I think you used the operative word the draft language for the seed law that included the three years. We continue to work with the coalition down there and that\u2019s a coalition made up of seed companies, trait and technology providers both from Argentina and outside of Argentina, grain handlers and interested farm groups to work with the government on the new seed law. ","So we pushed back substantially on that. I mean, they are looking for investment in agriculture and that just discourages investment in agriculture. So, we\u2019ve given that feedback and we think that\u2019s been well understood. But we\u2019ll continue to work with them on that draft language. ","In the interim, there is a resolution in place that we can work with that we did this year. We will continue to work with the government and the coalition to execute that resolution going into next year while we are in conjunction working on the new seed law and we will continue to look for better and better integrity in the system. ","As it speaks specifically to Xtend, we will continue to hold back on our Xtend technology until we see a system that has a higher level of integrity than what we currently see today and that can either be a new seed law that\u2019s negotiated to a better place or it can be improvements in the system that we already have operating that are satisfactory to the coalition. So, we will keep working on them, but we are going to hold back Xtend until we are confident it\u2019s in a better place. ","Steve Byrne ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Chris Evans ","Good morning, everyone. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. ","Hugh Grant","Hi, good morning, Chris.","Chris Evans ","Can you discuss the - good morning. Can you discuss the current sales environment in South America? I guess, most importantly, I guess, your expectation for a local currency pricing expectation sort of excluding your high adoption rate of Intacta? ","Brett Begemann","Yes, good morning, Chris. This is Brett. Happy to \u2013 and by coincidence, I was just in Brazil last week. So I fresh \u2013 fresh on my mind and had the opportunity to talk with a number of folks down there. So a couple of things, one, I think, first \u2013 so you mentioned Intacta and we are still finishing out the agreement we had with farmers from a number of years ago when we made the transition. So we are priced the same as we were last year and the feedback from farmers is, Intacta continues to deliver phenomenal value in the market. ","Anticipation is strong for increased yield or sales as reflected in the significant prepay that we enjoyed this year based on Intacta. ","In regards to corn, we took significant double-digit price increases across the corn portfolio and I look at it as trying to get back some of that loss from currency that we\u2019ve experienced in the last year or two and so far so good. ","I mean, it\u2019s working, the farmers understand and we just have to be respectful of their situation and work with them and communicate and so far so good. And we will continue that approach as we start looking at safrinha, which will be on top us right around the corner.","Hugh Grant","And the only thing I\u2019d add Bob, is the impact Intacta has had on insecticide sales there too, so growers are seeing great results and they are \u2013 they have been a lot more accurate and a lot more careful in their insecticide applications. So we have seen some nice substitution opportunities in the last two seasons. ","Chris Evans ","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. ","John Roberts ","Thank you. Maybe an easy one for Pierre, and then maybe a harder one for Hugh. Pierre, how are you defining strategic licensing as opposed to the rest of your licensing, and is that comp of $200 million for the upcoming year versus $370 million last year at the comp?","Pierre Courduroux","So, answering the second part of the question, yes, this is a comparable. These are comparable numbers. I mean, this is just the balancing between the segments that we tried to represent today in our prepared remarks. And the way we are thinking about the strategic deals is more in terms of important transfers of either IP or in certain cases, assets compared to ongoing licensing that we have on our lines and some of our traits. So it\u2019s really those are more unique in nature and compared to what we see in our business. So that\u2019s a distinction that we make in terms of the strategic licensing compared to the ongoing licensing that we have commonly. ","John Roberts ","And then, Hugh, when you bid for Syngenta over a year ago, I think Monsanto was willing to divest all of Syngenta\u2019s seed business. I believe the Bayer agreement has a $1.6 billion divestiture revenue threshold which I think if they had to divest all of the Bayer seed business plus glufosinate would be exceeded. So how do we think about that threshold?","Hugh Grant","Yes, John, you are right. You did ask Pierre the easy out of the two questions, thank you for that. So, it\u2019s a $1.6 billion threshold. The composition of that or the properties that will be sold versus retained hasn\u2019t been made public yet. So it\u2019s hard for me to comment on that. ","But I would go back to my earlier point that compared to the Syngenta deal that never happened, the overlap in this deal is significantly less because there is a much smaller overlap in the seeds and the seed properties. So, we will see how this plays out, John, but I think as we look at the overlap or the lack of overlap I am encouraged on how the two properties line up.","John Roberts ","Okay, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Jeff Zekauskas ","Thanks very much. Do you expect to file your definitive proxy in October or even by mid-October? And secondly, the point of the Bayer combination is to enhance innovation. Given how long it takes to bring new agricultural products to market, is it really the case that we'll find out if innovation is created 10 to 20 years from now rather than - I don't know, three to five years from now, do you think that that's an appropriate characterization?","Hugh Grant","Jeff, thanks very much for the two questions. I think, taking the last piece first\u2026 ","Jeff Zekauskas ","Sure. ","Hugh Grant","So, as you look at innovation, I think, number one, the needs never been greater, number two, I think there is capacity to accelerate innovation particularly in the area of digital agriculture and particularly in the area of precision agriculture where we are developing software and where we are using literally harvested data to improve decision quality on farm. ","So I don\u2019t \u2013 there is a piece there, I don\u2019t think you wait 10 or 20 years, there is a piece I think you see very quite clear, and Brett used some of those examples in his prepared remarks. So, I think it will be evidence of that acceleration as you bring these platforms together and to Brett\u2019s point, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s increasing cost for the grower, I think it increases efficiency and unlocks that extra bushel. ","And then, it\u2019s hard to see on the proxy, but our expectation would be, by the end of October. So the merger agreements are already out there. The frequently asked Q&As are out there already. And then the proxy will contain the next tranche of information around the deal and the history on the lead up to the deal. And I would expect we\u2019ll see that around the end of October. ","Jeff Zekauskas ","And you spoke of innovation in digital and precision, does Bayer accelerate innovation in digital and precision agriculture or could you do that on your own?","Hugh Grant","I think, to your point earlier, time will be the proof of this. ","Jeff Zekauskas ","Sure.","Hugh Grant","But I think, the more that you can bring up in that platform faster the quicker you build insights for the grower. So if you think back the \u2013 between climate and precision ag, we are in our third season. Brett talked about 95 million acres, so, very, very fast growth, but it\u2019s the quality of the [deal] [ph] that you bring in the platform, so the machinery companies now up, all of US distribution now up, and I think when we bring the Bayer and crop protection materials up, you just increase the density of the \u2013 and the subsequent quality of decision-making. And we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019d be spacing that platform for all of our competitors as well. So I think that this will be a broadly licensed platform and then the competitive element of this will be who delivers the best insights and I think Bayer will really help in that. ","Jeff Zekauskas ","Okay, good. Thank you so much. ","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Laura Meyer","Christine, we\u2019ll take questions from one more analyst, please. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO. Please proceed with your question. ","Joel Jackson ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question at the end here. You talk about a 20% increase in soybean gross profit in fiscal 2017, can you break that down a bit into the different buckets of how you get the 20% increase you\u2019re looking at and was it acreage increases, is it trade upgrades? Maybe give us a little more clarity on that?","Pierre Courduroux","So, this is Pierre. When you are looking at the 20 plus percent growth we are looking at in terms of the soybeans business, it\u2019s really, I mean, three different things, and all are significant in matter. So the first one is the continuation of Intacta. The growth of Intacta in South America where we are anticipating to be on 45 to 55 million acres. ","So this is a fairly large bucket of the growth we are looking into soybeans. The second element is related to our Xtend launch in the US where, based on the launch we had or the limited launch we had in 2015 \u2013 or in 2016, we feel very confident that we\u2019ll be able to reach the 15 million acres and the feedback we get from the field, the demand there is really very strong. So we feel very good about also those 15 million acres. ","And then, the third element of the growth is what we discussed earlier, which is basically the absence of some of the cost, we saw the launch cost, we saw in 2016 and we were talking about a $100 million there. So these are the three key drivers of the growth in soybeans and that\u2019s why we are very confident that we are going to see these 20% plus growth in our GP in soybeans. ","Joel Jackson ","So the last question I'd try to fit in is on currency, you talk about expecting stable currency in fiscal 2017 in your guide. You've obviously seen South American currencies really reappreciate. So is there room here for earnings to really hit the top-end of the range if currencies kind of hang around spot levels? Thanks.","Pierre Courduroux","So the way we\u2019ve been thinking of the guidance in general and as they were year when we entered the year we\u2019ve got a range of assumptions and currency is definitely one of the assumptions and definitely this is a sensitivity and the way we are looking at South America currencies right now are \u2013 I mean, especially the Brazilian Real is fairly favorable. But this is part of our range of guidance. So, definitely this is an element that we\u2019ve been considering. ","Joel Jackson ","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","So, thanks very much for your questions this morning. Let me just briefly summarize as we try to respect your time, so a big year ahead for Monsanto. Our plan to return to EPS growth in 2017 is on solid grounds and we are now eager as a team to get started and simply if you look at the year ahead, we have two priorities, delivering on the operations and the key milestones for the year to deliver that growth as well as executing on the necessary steps to close the deal with Bayer. ","So, as the year progresses, we look forward to updating you and as the process unfolds and thanks again for joining us on the call this morning. All the very best.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Monsanto Investor Relations League. Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Adam, and good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO and by Dr. Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Boeker, Priyal Patel and Ashley Wissmann.","Our first quarter call provides the initial insights into our fiscal year with the summary of our first quarter results and importantly our views into our outlook for the rest of the year. Additionally, as we always do in the first quarter, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline and product performance update. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.","We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the Web site.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","First and foremost, let me review our first quarter results as shown on Slide 4. Our first quarter ongoing loss per share of $0.11 was better than expected on the basis of lower than expected operating expenses and better Intacta sales in Brazil. When compared to the prior year, currency accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing earnings per share.","On an as reported basis, our first quarter loss per share was $0.56 reflecting $0.46 for restructuring charges consistent with our planned actions to reduce annual spend by 500 million by fiscal year '18. Finally, our free cash flow for the first quarter was more than $1 billion as compared to 969 million in the prior year reflecting the reduction in inventory and modest growth in our prepays.","With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Laura, and Happy New Year to everybody on the line this morning. First of all, a special thanks to the 130 of you who joined us at a recent Biennial Investor Event. We were pleased to share with you our long-term outlook and importantly an early preview into our outstanding pipeline and our product performance, which we\u2019ll build upon today.","Consistent with our earlier event, I\u2019d like to start the talk today with a topic of industry consolidation right at the beginning. First, we have an incredible standalone growth plan backed by our commitment to innovation and the industry\u2019s broadest, deepest and most important pipeline. Second, we expect industry consolidation to continue and it should given the opportunities for significant synergies and value creation and R&D across the industry.","Third, we expect to continue to be the partner of choice across the industry whether it\u2019s through our broad license and approach, through collaboration and partnerships or through strategic M&A.","Yes, two of our largest competitors recently announced that they\u2019re combining but they\u2019re also two of our largest technology licensees and we expect that to continue given the opportunities of our unparallel pipeline. Finally, we will continue with our disciplined approach to evaluating M&A opportunities as we seek a strong strategic fit and synergistic value.","So with that, let\u2019s move to the update for the quarter and our annual R&D pipeline update, which is more relevant than ever given the macro trends in agriculture as shown on Slide 5. We see innovation in agriculture as being pivotal in addressing the three mega trends namely sustainable food security, climate change and industry consolidation, and we believe our innovation places us in a unique position to lead in all of these areas.","As we move to Slide 6, this is our third consecutive year of more than 20 advancements and our core pipeline is still expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales. And this is before considering the upside value from our transformational new growth platforms. We continue to see significant growth from our core spanning the spectrum of grower needs. This ranges from breeding enhancements to deliver yield to multigenerational projects in the categories of insect and weed control.","Further, new platforms in climate and the BioAg alliance are beginning to show meaningful progress in the relatively untapped category of plant health and fertility. Collectively, this progress drives our ability to deliver what we expect to be greater than 1.3 billion acres of technology upgrades by 2025 providing sustainable intensification on our existing 400 million acre footprint as shown on Slide 7.","Today, however, the headwinds from currency and commodity prices that we outline at the start of this fiscal year have not yet abated, and in fact currency has become a much stronger headwind with the recent events in Argentina. We are pleased to see the early decisive approach of the new President and we believe that his actions, particularly the lifting of export taxes in grain will create longer-term benefits for agriculture for which we\u2019re well positioned to participate. However, the approximate 35% to 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso is expected to create an estimated $0.20 to $0.25 charge in Q2 and with that increased headwind, we now expect our fiscal year '16 ongoing EPS to trend to the lower half of our guidance range of $5.10 to $5.60 as shown on Slide 8.","Despite this currency pressure, we still have a strong outlook for cash generation and we continue to expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. And we\u2019ve continued our disciplined spend management with plans now in place to deliver on $500 million of annual cost savings by fiscal year '18. Despite these new term headwinds, we continue to confirm our long-term growth targets to deliver greater than 20% compounded annual growth in our ongoing earnings per share from the end of fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '19 as outlined in Slide 9.","In that timeframe, we expect demand transfer grain to continue and improve grower margins. We expect currency to remain relatively consistent with today\u2019s rates and importantly, we expect our innovation to carry 80% of the expected profit growth with continued industry leading corn hybrid renewal and growth from the Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend blockbusters in soybeans.","The breadth, depth and productivity of our pipeline gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well as the strong role that we believe we will play in addressing the evolving landscape across agriculture. With the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology in hand to create the 9 to 14 gene stacks by 2025, we expect to lead and define the integrated solutions for the industry.","So with that introduction, let me hand it over to Brett for the operational update.","Brett D. Begemann","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Delivery of our near-term and long-term targets that Hugh just shared with you hinges on our ability to deliver on our key operational priorities, namely delivering $3.5 billion of expected gross profit growth from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '19, upgrading the industry\u2019s largest seed technology platform to the Xtend technology, monetizing our new growth platforms and maintaining our financial discipline as outlined on Slide 10. Let\u2019s look at these priorities in more detail with an update on relevant key milestones from the first quarter and how those will inform the rest of fiscal year '16.","First, let\u2019s take a look at our global corn seed franchise. With industry leading share positions in almost every one of our major corn regions, as shown on Slide 11, we plan to drive our growth off of this leading footprint from a combination of continued share gains and annual price mix lift gains in germplasm. Even in this challenging ag environment we continue to target to hold or grow share in every major corn growing region in fiscal year '16. And while it is still early days to estimate share gains, we are confident that we grew our corn brand share in the summer season in Brazil.","And in the northern hemisphere, the dealer and grower order book volumes and prepays in the U.S. are tracking modestly ahead of the prior year despite the continued compressed commodity prices. Not only do we continue to pursue or plan to hold or grow share in every major corn growing region in fiscal year '16, but we continue to target to deliver positive low single digit price mix lift in corn germplasm globally exclusive of currency impacts. In Brazil, we\u2019ve been able to deliver germplasm price mix lift at 10% exclusive of currency in the first quarter, which has allowed us to moderate a portion of the currency downsides, and we will continue to target to do so going forward.","In the U.S. order book after our pricing ladder adjustments, the year-one to three hybrids make up 50% to 60% of the portfolio consistent with the trends we outlined on Slide 12. The continuation of our industry leading performance supports this targeted mix lift. However, our realized mix lift will ultimately be determined in the second and third quarters where we will be closely monitoring discounting in this environment of compressed grower margins.","Moving beyond corn to soybeans, our second largest gross profit driver for fiscal year '19, we continue to see great uptake of our Intacta technology in South America. Our results came in better than forecasted in the first quarter, in part due to Intacta sales and we remain confident in our target to penetrate 30 million acres across South America in just the third year of launch, as you can see on Slide 13. With this greater than four bushel average yield advantage and reduction in insecticide sprays, growers continue to demand Intacta technology and what we see as a 100 million acre opportunity in South America.","And while Intacta has had the fastest penetration of any biotech trade to-date, we expect Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans to top this level with greater than 3 million acres expected this year in its first year of commercial launch. Based on our U.S. reservation system, we feel confident in the demand for more than 3 million acres of the technology. We\u2019ve also been progressing with our Dicamba chemistry strategy and closed on multiple supply agreements as shown on Slide 14. These agreements are expected to provide us with adequate supply of Dicamba in the early years following launch and together with our pending self-manufacturing plans are expected to provide a balanced approach to cost effective Dicamba supply.","Not to be outdone, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is expected to penetrate 1.5 million acres this season in the U.S., double the more than 750,000 acres in fiscal year '15\u2019s limited commercial introduction. Not only do we expect this to create value from improved weed control but we expect these new varieties to drive share in Deltapine seed just as it did in fiscal year '15.","Moving beyond our core businesses, we continue to progress with our plans for the coming U.S. season at Climate where we\u2019re working towards the closing of our most recent agreement with John Deere, which uniquely positions us with exclusive third-party near-real time connectively and in-cab visualization of data. This agreement marks our third connectivity agreement with the major equipment dealers and is a great addition to our industry leading retail network to the top six U.S. ag retailers.","In addition, this agreement is accelerating both grower and retailer interest in the technology. This reach combined with the capabilities of our advisors and the adoption we\u2019ve secured to-date, as shown on Slide 15, establishes Climate as the digital ag platform and we expect to continue that momentum in fiscal year '16 with the expected penetration to 12 million paid acres and platform adoption to an expected 90 million acres as shown on Slide 16.","Our success, however, is based on more than gross profit growth drivers I have just outlined. It is also predicated on the continuation of discipline, discipline and how we manage our existing ag productivity business segment and discipline in how we execute our restructuring and cost savings plans.","On the ag productivity front, we saw the tough comparison we expected in the first quarter results with generic prices down significantly versus the prior year and very challenging comparisons on currencies particularly in Brazil, we experienced year-over-year declines in pricing of more than 20% inclusive of currency. Overall, however, as shown on Slide 17, we still expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year as we expect to continue to manage our price premium closely and pick up the decline in volumes from Q1 in the latter half of the year.","Moving to the topic of discipline spend management, we now have restructuring plans and cost savings initiatives in place that align to our target to deliver 500 million in annual savings by fiscal year '18. The actions we disclosed earlier today build from the foundation we outlined on Slide 18 to streamline the organization to create enduring and durable savings. We are focused on creating scale and efficiency while still delivering outstanding innovation and customer service through the creation of four commercial hubs and a R&D center of excellence and from fully leveraging data analytics.","With that, let me pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone on the line. Before I go into the financial review on our business outlook for the year, let me start with the results from the first quarter as shown on Slide 4. First, we delivered a loss of $0.11 per share on an ongoing basis, which was better than expected ongoing loss of $0.23 to $0.33. That improvement versus our expectation was driven by lower operating expenses and by better than expected results in Intacta in Brazil.","Specifically, operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, were 9% lower than the prior year mostly driven by currency. From a year-to-year perspective, currency and particularly the Brazilian real accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing earnings per share. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in earnings per share versus the prior year was mostly due to the decline in ag productivity gross profit related to the anticipated glyphosate price declines and the impact of the timing of glyphosate deliveries.","Seed and genomic gross profit was mostly impacted by the anticipated reduction in corn volumes rising from timing shifts and lower planted acres in the southern hemisphere. Offsetting some of those declines was the 125 million of gross profit growth in soybeans before the effect of currency led by the strong performance of Intacta.","Second, on a net reported basis, we reported a loss of $0.56 per share reflecting 210 million of after-tax restructuring charges in the quarter. We have now recorded approximately 70% of the expecting restructuring charges and this sets us on pace for the 500 million of annual cost savings we\u2019re expecting by fiscal year '18, as outlined on Slide 19.","Third, from a cash flow perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of free cash representing a 6% increase versus the prior year. As expected, this reflects the cash benefit of the implementation of a disciplined corn seed production plan that drove significant inventory reductions, as well as modest growth in our prepays in the U.S.","Moving to the outlook for the year, with the recent currency devaluation in Argentina, we now expect to trend to the lower half of our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $5.10 to $5.60 for the full year, as shown on Slide 20. We expect an approximate $0.20 to $0.25 net downside to our ongoing EPS in the second quarter related to the approximate 35% to 40% weakening of the Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar.","We\u2019re expecting to book a one-time significant charge in the second quarter related to our net balance sheet exposure and expect modest variability in the adjustment thereafter as we will mark to the currency evolution every month. Altogether, from a currency perspective, we are now expecting $0.60 to $0.70 of currency headwinds for the full year versus the prior expectation of $0.35 to $0.40 with the Argentine peso accounting for the majority of this increase.","Despite some moderating in our outlook for currency and corn price mix lift with a competitive pricing dynamics in this challenging ag environment, we still see an opportunity for a 5% to 7% growth in seed and genomics gross profit. We continue to expect this growth to come from the benefit of the 275 million or more in expected licensing agreements from corn germplasm mix lift in the low single digit exclusive of currency, from targeted corn share gains and from the growth in our Intacta soybeans.","This growth is expected to be partially offset by the expected cost of $70 million to $80 million as associated with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend launch and the $90 million to $100 million of incremental corn cost of goods coming from the smaller corn seed production plans.","For ag productivity, we continue to expect gross profit to be in the range of 900 million to 1.1 billion as we expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year at prices expected to improve slightly as we move through the fiscal year. Based on the estimated savings from the additional restructuring actions, continued cost savings and currency benefits, we now expect operating expenses exclusive of restructuring and environmental and litigation settlement expenses to be flat versus fiscal year '15, inclusive of new platform spend.","Other income and expense considering the expected impact from the Argentine peso devaluation is expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million worse than the prior year on a full year basis. Beyond the operating profit drivers, the net effect of our ongoing $3 billion accelerated share repurchase, including increased financing, should generate a net annual EPS benefit of $0.24 to $0.27 unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect the ASR to close and be trued up in the next three months closing up another key step in the progress of our capital allocation strategy.","From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to a balanced approach between share repurchases, dividends, capital investments and investments in technology, as shown on Slide 21. This approach combined with our commitment to a solid investment grade credit rating that allows access to commercial paper should allow us to operate with strategic flexibility to invest in high growth opportunities that support our strategy while giving us the latitude to execute on larger scale opportunities as appropriate.","Backing this strategy is our ability to convert earnings into strong cash generation. Overall, even as our earnings guidance moves to the lower half of our range, we still expect to generate $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year '16. We see the opportunity to growth this in future year absent the approximately $200 million to $250 million of after-tax restructuring charge costs we expect to incur in fiscal year '16.","As I shared at our investor event, my focus is on return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation, all of which support long-term growth and return of value to our shareowners. Continuing to execute well on these pillars along with delivering on the innovation in our pipeline provides the gateway to the rapid future business growth necessary to deliver on our plan to grow our ongoing EPS by more than 20% annually from fiscal year '17 to fiscal year '19.","Thanks. I\u2019ll turn the time over to Rob for the annual pipeline update.","Dr. Robert T. Fraley","Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everybody. This is an exciting time for technology. The convergence of the advances in biology and data science are transforming agriculture, both expanding the breadth of what\u2019s possible today and accelerating the pace of innovation.","On Slide 4, you can see the unparallel diversity of platforms and the significant number of technologies that we draw upon both internally and externally to drive new innovations. And as excited as I am about what we do in our own world class research organization, I\u2019m really equally proud of the work we do through collaborations with academics, public and private sector partners and strategic M&A deals.","Over the last few years, we\u2019ve initiated venture capital investments in 20 plus organizations in key areas of agricultural productivity, digital agriculture and biologicals complementing our company\u2019s integrated systems approach to drive future growth. Which brings me to a key point; innovation is delivering the growth engine that will take us well into the next decade.","On the heels of two $1 billion plus blockbuster product launches expected with Intacta and Xtend, this is a robust pipeline of multigenerational upgrades expected to deliver up to 25 billion in peak net sales in the core alone as shown on slides 5 through 7 with considerable upside potential from our new platforms.","I\u2019m particularly excited about our 30 advancements this year, which is the third consecutive year of greater than 20 pipeline advancements as shown on Slide 8. And I think this progress showcases the breadth and depth of our integrated yield pipeline, which really fuels innovation for the industry.","As we look at the agronomic focal points for a grower, yield is by far the biggest one and our pipeline value aligns with that targeting to deliver estimated peak net sales of up to $14.5 billion. Now breeding is clearly our cornerstone and as you\u2019ll see on Slide 9, we\u2019re expanding our capability and advantage and further transforming our breeding program.","The success of our breeding program has been built on three competitive advantages. We have the largest and most diverse germplasm library on the planet and that\u2019s paired with the industry best discovery technologies such as high throughput, screening, advanced markers and seed shipping and finally we have the largest global integrated testing network, which we leverage to identify, select and deploy the best performing seeds globally.","But now using genome-wide section, we expect to create a step change in breeding allowing us to significant increase the size and rate of our germplasm screening. We expect to be able to analyze 10 times more breeding crosses by the beginning of the next decade based initially on DNA sequence knowledge and predictive analytics, which we expect will translate to a 30% increase in genetic gain giving us even more horsepower to upgrade our global germplasm portfolio every year. So this competitive advantage in R&D is what feeds our biggest commercial advantage.","On Slide 10, I\u2019m pleased to share with you that for the 10th consecutive year, DEKALB Corn has been delivering an average yield increase of 7 to 10 bushels advantage in the U.S. across the gamut of growing conditions, which really underscores the consistent performance advantage. Final harvest results for this year once again show a strong performance advantage of more than 7 bushels per acre versus the competition, and it doesn\u2019t stop there. On Slide 11 with our advances in molecular breeding, our class of 2017 is expected to deliver 6 to 10 bushels more than our best commercial hybrids today.","Let\u2019s look at soybeans next on Slide 12. Roundup Ready 2 yield, the established second generation platform for herbicide tolerance, continues to deliver a greater than 4 bushel per acre average advantage as compared to the original Roundup Ready soybeans. And our new generation of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans provide superior weed control and has the same high yield as Roundup Ready 2 varieties.","As we look to the future, the class of 2017 Roundup Ready 2 Xtend varieties shows increasing yield performance, which reflects the benefit of the improved mix of the latest genetics in the new platform and the accelerating use of molecular markers in soybeans. And finally, the panel on the right shows the greater than 70 varieties for this spring\u2019s expected launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans showcasing the genetic breadth and product performance that sets up our biggest expected biotech seed launch.","Moving to cotton, our leading Deltapine cotton varieties on Slide 13 demonstrate 70 pounds of lint per acre performance advantage for the sixth consecutive year, again underscoring consistent yield advantage and setting up the rapid adoption of Bollgard II XtendFlex.","Continuing in the yield category is our work in yield and stress. We are streamlining our focus based on insights from the last decade and through our joint research collaboration with BASF, we\u2019ve been able to identify a series of key enabling traits that we believe will lead to increased yield. And I\u2019d like to highlight two projects leveraging this trait-first approach as shown on Slide 14, that is the next generation of a higher yielding corn and soy both in phase 1.","And in collaboration with BASF, our next generation higher yielding corn exhibits stronger roots and stocks and in soy, the novel soybean yield trait demonstrated plants with more pods in its first year of field testing. We\u2019re also highlighting two new breeding projects that are making significant breakthroughs in yield beyond our annual germplasm refresh.","On Slide 15, our high density corn systems are examples of how we\u2019re leveraging germplasm, which can perform at higher plant populations and drive yield. With the potential to aggregate this with insights from our Climate Script Creator, we can help growers target precise seed placement to optimize yield.","Let\u2019s move to weed control. 2016 represents the 20th anniversary of the Roundup Ready trait, a platform that has penetrated over 350 million acres making it the largest trait platform in the world. With our Roundup Ready Xtend crop system shown on Slide 16, we are going to refresh that broad platform and we\u2019re progressing third and fourth generation weed control systems to provide additional modes of action and weed control well into the future.","Complementarily linked to these systems is chemistry. We have five next generation chemistries for weed control advancing in our crop protection pipeline shown in Slide 17. And these products target much needed improvements in solutions beyond what\u2019s possible in the market today. XtendiMax and Roundup Ready Xtend contain our proprietary VaporGrip technology, which will offer superior, season long weed control with residual activity in new, easy-to-use, low volatility Dicamba formulations.","We\u2019re also working on a premix of Warrant Herbicide and Dicamba, which will combine the crop-safe encapsulated form of acetochlor with Dicamba and this will make it easier to apply multiple modes of action in a single application to control both grass and broadleaf weeds making it I think a very effective component of our Roundup Ready Xtend system across soybean, corn and cotton and with a fit on up to 100 million acres at peak penetration.","So these novel chemistry formulations along with the robust pipeline of multigenerational herbicide trait upgrades that are coming behind Xtend are expected to deliver up to 4.5 billion in peak net sales.","Jumping even further into the future, we\u2019re developing the next generation complex gene stacks that will become the future platforms. Our technology team has already discovered the stacked corn and soybean trait products that we expect to launch in 2025.","On Slide 18, you can see that the future of corn product is expected to have 14 traits; four unique belowground insect protection traits, four unique aboveground insect protection traits, five unique herbicide tolerance traits plus a novel yield and stress trait. And as you can see on the bottom of this slide, the story repeats. The future soybean stacks we have in hand are expected to give rise to a nine-gene stack in that same timeframe.","I think the point is, is that we know today which products are going to redefine the competitive standard in 2025. Our global regulatory track record combined with our leading seed and licensing footprint makes us a partner of choice in this industry, and we\u2019re currently working with several parties to co-develop the next generation of weed control pairing traits from new breakthrough chemistry modes of action as shown on Slide 19. And by working in parallel to develop new weed control systems, these exciting collaborations and partnerships are expected to allow us to create next generation products far more quickly.","Insect control is another critical grower need where like weed control we have a pipeline of multigenerational upgrades of novel insect protection traits in progress, and these are valued at up to 4 billion in net peak sales. As you look across the key crops on slides 20 to 22, you can see that we have four products in phase 4. And by the end of the decade, we expect to launch all of these products; from SmartStax Pro across the Americas to the second generation of Intacta for South America, and all of which target some of the most significant pests in agriculture.","And this year, several of these are progressing in our pipeline including the fourth generation corn rootworm, the fourth generation aboveground insect protection in corn as well as the third generation insect protection in soybeans. These products are expected to deliver new modes of action for increased durability and many offer broader spectrum of control.","I\u2019d like to highlight the work that we\u2019re doing with lygus. The Bollgard platform has revolutionized cotton protection around the world with its control of the bollworm and other caterpillar pests. I believe the lygus product will be an equivalent breakthrough product for controlling sucking and piercing insects such as lygus, thrips and leafhoppers, which have emerged as the major pests in cotton production. This technology will not only protect yield but farmers today are spraying extensively to control these pests, which combined with estimated losses cost farmers nearly $200 million annually.","Rounding out our core is our focus to deliver disease control solutions in an integrated system and these are estimated to deliver peak net sales of up to $3.5 billion. First in corn, on Slide 23, across the major diseases such as stalk rot, northern corn leaf blight and Goss\u2019 wilt, it\u2019s clear that our breeding techniques are providing growers with enhanced disease protection.","To complement this, we\u2019re pleased to share the advancement of our Acceleron Seed Treatment, an enhanced fungicide offering moving to phase 4. This new chemical seed treatment in corn has averaged an impressive 3 bushels per acre yield increase versus the standard seed treatment and provides growers with early season disease control and late season stalk rot suppression.","Our disease solutions expand beyond breeding and chemistry and today we\u2019re announcing that we have identified lead genes for transgenic broad spectrum disease control, and layer on top of this the disease insights provided by our climate field health advisor and we\u2019re developing an unparalleled integrated disease control system.","Additionally, as shown in Slide 24, we continue to make progress in our vegetable business with conventional breeding techniques this year advancing disease-resistant tomatoes and cucumbers.","One of the most exciting new products in our pipeline is a novel molecule for nematode control shown on Slide 25. So nematodes are a persistent soil pest across all crops resulting in about $1 billion in crop losses in U.S. soybeans alone and in excess of $10 billion in losses annually across all row crops across the globe.","In its second year of expanded field testing, the NEMASTRIKE Technology is showing outstanding field performance across several crops and we expect it will become a key component of our Acceleron Seed Treatment portfolio as well as attract licensing interest from third parties.","And building on the success with NEMASTRIKE, as shown on Slide 26, we\u2019ve expanded our crop chemical approach through a collaboration with Nimbus Therapeutics. Using their unique computationally driven approach we\u2019ve identified a novel fungicide chemistry currently in phase 1 that is demonstrating increased yield protection in corn in the presence of Rhizoctonia and Fusarium disease versus both untreated and commercial standard checks.","These projects, whether in breeding, biotechnology, crop protection or climate, demonstrate the breadth and depth of our systems approach to delivering disease control solutions.","So now shifting to our new growth platforms, I\u2019d like to begin with microbials on Slide 27. We\u2019re in collaboration with Novozymes. We\u2019re working to understand which microbes we can use to treat seeds to improve nutrient uptake, promote growth and provide insect control and disease protection.","In the early phase work, microbial strains are advancing from discovery to phase 1 for disease and insect control. And in the later stage, our enhanced corn inoculant lead, as shown on Slide 28, is advancing from phase 2 to phase 4 and is planned for a 2017 U.S. launch. This enhanced formulation delivers critical seed stability and our 2015 yield data showed a greater than 4 bushel per acre average yield advantage.","Ultimately, the interplay between this technology and our data science tools will allow us to position the right seed in the right field with the right microbial supplement to stimulate productivity and yield.","The other platform within biologicals is our BioDirect platform shown on Slide 29 where we\u2019re developing new topically applied RNAi-based tools to target plant disease, insect and weed control as well as targets that enhance bee health. And first in bee health on Slide 30, the BioDirect technology is demonstrating significant improvement in beehive survival by targeting the varroa mite, a pest that feeds on the bee. With this efficacy we\u2019ve advanced this project to phase 2.","And in the BioDirect canola flea beetle project on Slide 31, it\u2019s advancing to phase 1. Today, flea beetles cause about $300 million in damages in North America alone and this technology would provide growers with an alternative solution to the neonics currently used to control flea beetles. So with the significant strides we\u2019ve made in BioDirect manufacturing, we see tangible solutions coming to market to help growers.","Let\u2019s shift to our digital ag platform shown on Slide 32. In just two years after acquisition, we have a fully populated pipeline supporting our digital ag platform. First, let\u2019s look at the exciting field results for our nitrogen advisor. Nutrients are one of agriculture\u2019s most significant inputs with a global market of more than $180 billion. This year, our nitrogen advisor was on millions of acres, as you can see on Slide 33, and we saw phenomenal results across the sample of more than 3,800 fields.","Over 10% of those fields showed a nitrogen shortfall, which resulted in significant yield loss and more than 40% of the field had excess nitrogen. When you add it all up, it exceeds $10 per acre of value on average and across the U.S. market that\u2019s $1 billion opportunity. Now, we\u2019re developing models to optimize within a field where there\u2019s significant variation of nitrogen levels at any given time. And in fact, we\u2019re advancing our subfield nitrogen tool which will be field tested during the 2016 season. And finally, as we develop models for other crops like wheat and canola, we\u2019ll start to unlock more of that multibillion dollar opportunity.","Moving to Slide 34, other highlights for the platform are our foundational connectivity, data capture and visualization tools where we\u2019re seeing real commercial progress and a rapidly evolving pipeline. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our Climate Fieldview Drive, which enables seamless connectivity while passing through the field.","Our recent agreement with John Deere enables near real-time connectivity through their wireless data server. And so at the end of the day, regardless of the brand of their equipment, growers will have access to seamless data transferred to the cloud unlocking our unique ability to deliver actionable insights to millions of acres.","I\u2019d like to wrap up by summarizing a few key points on Slide 35. First, we have never had a sense of complacency about our R&D leadership and now once again we\u2019re transforming our efforts. And the efforts we\u2019re making now to change breeding are raising the bar dramatically on what it will take to compete in this industry in the future.","In the area of biotechnology, we\u2019re putting in place literally today the future of 14-gene stacked products for corn and the nine-gene stacked for soybean that we believe will create an incredible competitive advantage and unique value to our growers.","We have novel new next generation seed treatments, fungicides, herbicides and biologicals progressing in our crop protection portfolio. And with the progress we\u2019re seeing in our new platforms, there\u2019s been a translation from concept to reality that\u2019s played out in just two short seasons.","Importantly, we\u2019re integrating these technologies starting at the research level just like we\u2019ve been doing in our core breeding and biotech platforms for years. Second point, all of this innovation not only makes for an incredibly exciting time for technology but it plays a role I think of significant importance in addressing the key global macro trends that Hugh discussed.","The innovations we deliver will create more yield to meet the increasing global demand for grains in a more sustainable, targeted and precise manner. And finally I think what\u2019s clear is our unique breeding and biotech engine has been transformative to the crop protection industry. Today, the growing depth of our pipeline along with our new digital ag and biologicals platforms gives us a unique view on how the crop protection landscape will continue to evolve going forward and places us in a position of strength in a dynamic industry.","So thanks for your time today. I\u2019ll turn it back over to Laura for the Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks, Rob. With that, we\u2019d now like to open the call for questions. As we typically do, I\u2019ll ask that you please how your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You\u2019re always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow up. Adam, we\u2019re ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead with your question.","Don Carson","Thank you. Hugh, a question on industry consolidation. In 2015, you made two offers for Syngenta but then you dropped it because you weren\u2019t getting any direct discussions. Are you finding a different receptivity on their part to discussions? Are you in direct discussions and able to look at any financial data?","Hugh Grant","Don, thanks for the question. Happy New Year to you. So you\u2019re right, we had two runs at Syngenta last year. The belief that we had last April we still have that there is a significant opportunity there for the integrated platform. And frankly as the industry goes through challenges, I think that opportunity becomes even greater. Growers are looking for help. A lot has changed in the industry since last spring. The industry has gotten tougher and I would say we expected some of that. The operating environment has become tougher as well. And I think because of that, there\u2019s a greater need now than there was last spring to be able to quantify what that opportunity would look like and quantify what that integrated platform would look like. So, engagement becomes more important now than it did before with Syngenta and we haven\u2019t seen much progress on that front. So when you look at some of the challenges in the industry and look at some of the challenges that their portfolio faces, I think \u2013 I\u2019d say that engagement has been difficult.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. On the order book, could you just \u2013 you mentioned there\u2019s a modest uptick in prepays but when I look at your deferred revenue line it looks like it\u2019s up by more than a modest amount. So are you being modest about the prepays or is there some disconnect between those two figures?","Pierre Courduroux","So, Vincent, this is Pierre. Good morning. So there is definitely an accounting disconnect in between the order book and the amount of prepay and what you see in the deferred revenue. So long story short, what we see today which gives us confidence in our plan right now is an uptake in our order book. As Brett mentioned, a modest uptake in our order book versus last year and about $100 million more prepays than last year. From an accounting perspective, you see a huge spike in deferred revenue because we have got less glyphosate receivable that we usually use to offset some of those deferred revenues. So visually it looks like you\u2019ve got a huge increase in deferred revenue. But at the end of the day I think what you have to keep in mind is we\u2019ve got an increasing prepay of about $100 million which is very positive.","Vincent Andrews","And can I just ask you on the foreign exchange on Argentina, you use the term charge, one-time, et cetera. Does that imply that this reverses out next year?","Pierre Courduroux","Well, I mean the thing about Argentina for us is Argentina is a U.S. dollar functional entity for us, which means we have to revalue our balance sheet basically on a monthly basis. And when you have a 35% to 40% devaluation as we are currently seeing, you have that big one-time charge which is basically the revaluation of your balance sheet. On an ongoing basis assuming flat currency, you would expect it to stay flat. And from a pure business perspective, as you know, we\u2019ve got some flexibility in Argentina in the way we price. So really what we\u2019re looking at, at this point in time in Argentina, is really the devaluation impact on our balance sheet because it\u2019s a U.S. dollar functional entity.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect. Thank you. You\u2019ve got a few extra pages on your R&D presentation this year. But specifically on pages 19 and 23, you mentioned collaborations with numerous chemical companies in both weed control and seed treatments and fungicides, I believe that one was with Bayer. But can you quickly give a little color on how much of the weed control agreements pertain to the Roundup Ready PLUS program, specifically glyphosate resistance? And also how your R&D team evaluates these agreements versus hypothetically bringing in in-house including potential for M&A? Thanks.","Dr. Robert T. Fraley","Thanks. This is Rob. I appreciate the question. And as I made in my formal comments, one of the things that I\u2019m really focused on as an R&D leader is to be externally focused. And in particular we\u2019ve been very aggressive in partnerships in both the disease control with Novozymes with the insect and weed control opportunities to bring in technologies from around the world that we think can supplement our pipeline. And particularly in the case of the weed control opportunities as we\u2019re building those future generation of stacked products, we want to have multiple modes of action to control both the grass and broadleaf weeds that we believe will be important for growers both to control their difficult to control weeds as well as to control weeds that have become resistant to Roundup. I\u2019d say most of the targets that we\u2019ve approached in the weed control area are designed to supplement, support and ensure the long-term performance of the Roundup Ready trait system. And incidentally in addition to those external projects, you\u2019ll note that we had a release today that talked about some of the investments that we\u2019ve made in startup companies through our venture capital fund which we\u2019ve made an investment in over 20 startups that again cover chemistry, biologicals and data science tools. So that external focus is really important.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, hi, good morning. You know you talked about lower corn inventory. Was that lower inventory in anticipation of lower corn acres or was that your effort to reduce SKUs? And then do you think the industry has excess inventory that could potentially lead to some price competition that Brett talked about?","Pierre Courduroux","So P.J., I\u2019ll talk about our own inventory and I\u2019ll let Brett give you the outlook regarding the market conditions. But as far as we are concerned, this is a decision we made last year actually. As you can remember, last year we entered the year and we\u2019re surprised with commodity price and the reduction in acres. So we had production plans in 2014 that were way higher than the market we saw in 2015. So we did an adjustment exactly to avoid the risk you are mentioning that we end up with excess inventory. So this is the production plan of 2015 that has been lower which really helps now from a cash flow perspective because as you could see in the first quarter, we had good results from an inventory perspective. But this is the decision we made at the time. So from a pure market perspective, I\u2019ll let Brett comment on that.","Brett D. Begemann","Good morning, P.J. I think as Pierre said, we\u2019re in a really good position with our inventory and I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable with that at all, not only in the U.S. but globally at this point in time. More of a challenge that we face in the market that we see today is driven by the depressed commodity situation and it\u2019s encouraging. I would say more discounting for sure this year than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years. And that\u2019s why I pointed out this morning really the second and third quarter is going to determine how much mix lift we get out of this because there\u2019s \u2013 some of our competitors are being quite aggressive from a pricing standpoint. It\u2019s late in the year. As I always say by the time we get to this point, it\u2019s not changing share a whole lot, it\u2019s just going to change price mix is what it\u2019s going to do because everybody is going to fight to defend their own position. But there\u2019s clearly more of it this year, P.J., than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you. And Brett, quickly can you give a clarification on I think in the comment you made in the outlook that there is $275 million of additional licensing opportunity. Is that new opportunity that you do not have before in the plans? Thank you.","Pierre Courduroux","So, P.J, I\u2019ll take this one. These are the opportunities we mentioned entering into the year. And the way we\u2019ve been thinking about it is basically I mean leveraging our pipeline, leveraging our portfolio, leveraging our climate platform. So obviously those are confidential in nature and we\u2019re not going to give much more detail than that. But this is really what we were talking about entering into the year. There is no change from that perspective.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven Byrne","Yes, thank you. Presumably, you have a pretty good idea how many acres of Intacta soybeans are in the ground right now. My question would be how much of that revenue did you recognize in the November quarter versus the fiscal second quarter? What fraction of that would be prepaid cash versus POD and what was your net realized royalty price per acre?","Brett D. Begemann","I think one way to look at that Steve is I think we have to remind ourselves that the Brazil approach to the market is a little bit different than what we\u2019re looking at in the U.S., which most people are more familiar with. In Brazil, the farmer has choices. They can buy their seed and pay right up front. They can buy their seed and agree to pay at POD or legally they can save seed and pay with POD. As we said, the big shift has occurred and the vast majority of farmers are buying new seed every year but they get that choice. It also goes to market through seed multipliers, which are a step removed from us. We do not have the kind of insight in the marketplace that we enjoy in the U.S. where we have a large branded business ourselves and a handful of other large branded players that we can get information from as a licensee. So we just don\u2019t have that down there. What I can tell you today is I feel really confident in our 30 million acres of Intacta in Brazil and I\u2019m really excited about the demand that we see from the farmers. It\u2019s too early for us to be able to call how much of that was prepaid and how much of that was bought seed and whether or not it\u2019s going to be above 30 million acres. But I feel really good about the 30 million acres that we laid out today.","Steven Byrne","And any comment on the net realization per acre?","Pierre Courduroux","Well, what we mentioned in terms of the \u2013 price per acre? Price per acre is very consistent with basically what we outline entering into the year. This is a royalty we collect. So the key balance is going to be in between POD and the prepaid. And as of today we are pretty much in line with our expectation. As we announced today, we\u2019ve had a really good first quarter in terms of Intacta and actually have some nice growth, obviously excluding the impact of currency. And as Brett was saying, now we\u2019re entering in the second quarter where we will know the final numbers. But as of now it really looks pretty good about Intacta both on a volume in acres basis but also from a pricing perspective.","Steven Byrne","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Maguire","Good morning. It\u2019s actually Brian Maguire on for Bob. I think I heard you mention that you expect glyphosate pricing to improve throughout the year, throughout 2016. Just wondering what indicators or metrics you\u2019re looking at to try and give you confidence that pricing might start to inflect upwards in '16?","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, thank you, good morning. This is Brett. As you look at Roundup and you\u2019re right, we did say that we would expect it through the latter half of the year that we would see some improvement in price. We haven\u2019t seen that start to occur yet. It\u2019s been more flattish, which really leads to the wider range that we\u2019ve given around our ag productivity business this year. If you assume prices kind of float around where they are today then we were at the low end of that range. And if they do get some lift throughout the rest of the year, we would see it flow to the higher end of that range but that\u2019s what drives the breadth of that range. I think a couple of things to keep in mind is China price is clearly an impact on what the price is but also what kind of margin opportunity the generics participate in. So we watch the generic price in the marketplace. That\u2019s what our farmers are looking at. We don\u2019t price based on what\u2019s going on in China. We price based on the generics in the market and we have not seen them start to lift those prices. But in most of the world we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty good place right now with some hope that the price will continue or will lift towards the latter half of the year.","Brian Maguire","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Sandy Klugman","Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could provide an update on the anticipated timeline for regulatory approvals for Xtend. And then if you don\u2019t receive approvals in time for the spring planting season, should we expect the 2017 launch to be even larger given that I assume you\u2019ll have more varieties to offer next year than you would this year?","Hugh Grant","Sandy, thanks for your question. I\u2019ll say a few words and maybe ask Brett to say some. So first off, and Rob mentioned this in his presentation as well, strong demand, so an enormous amount of encouragement from growers and from the field. They see Xtend as a tool that they really, really need and frankly they are tired of waiting. So this has gone on for a long time. We\u2019re in the final stages. We\u2019ve provided, and Rob can probably underscore this, we\u2019ve provided all the data to the regulatory authorities. And frankly we were encouraged by the exchange between President Obama and Premier Xi during his visit. So the public statement that came from that was encouraging. So we\u2019re now waiting on the finalization of that and I think it\u2019s imminent, and also the EPA. So Brett anything that you\u2019d add to that from a field point of view?","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, I would just add that to Hugh\u2019s point we feel like we\u2019re on track with those approvals. I\u2019d just remind you that there are two different approvals. One approval for China is for the seed and the other approval from the EPA is for applications of Dicamba over the top of the crop. So both of those set us in different situations and we\u2019ll watch both. And for the full system to be executed, we need both. But if we get a China approval, for example, that puts us in position to sell the seed and you might think about what we looked at last year with cotton. We found ourselves in that same situation with cotton last year. Not suggesting that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be. I\u2019m just saying that there are different options for us to pursue and we\u2019re living this real-time right now.","Sandy Klugman","Okay, great. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the cotton front. If you don\u2019t get the over-the-top registration for Dicamba in the domestic market, I assume growers will receive a rebate similar to what they received last year?","Brett D. Begemann","That\u2019s the way we would look at it. And the whole approach behind that is getting the farmers comfortable with the varieties and buying new varieties and I missed that in your earlier question. Yes, if we have the opportunity to get some out there whether they used the whole system or not it will make for a bigger launch next year than this year. So it definitely benefits us and the farmer to get that experience with the new varieties.","Sandy Klugman","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Hugh Grant","And that\u2019s been our general approach. But as I said at the start, you\u2019ve got a lot of growers out there frustrated and getting tired of waiting. So it\u2019d be nice to see weeds controlled with this system this year.","Sandy Klugman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Chase & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning.","Jeff Zekauskas","Dow licenses SmartStax on relatively advantageous terms. If they do combine with DuPont, does that larger entity that\u2019s formed, are they allowed to license SmartStax on the same terms or would a new agreement have to be put in place? How does that technology licensing work?","Hugh Grant","Yes, Jeff, thanks for the question. So for \u2013 I guess Rob said on the 20th anniversary of Roundup Ready, I think for 20 years we\u2019ve licensed broadly with an open architecture system and licensed the industry. That will continue but for 20 years, we haven\u2019t discussed the content of these licenses. So we license company by company and the content of those licensees is confidential. What I would say broadly is the design of those licensees, they commute so they are not triggered by change of control and that allows consistency regardless of what companies do and how the genealogy plays out and I expect that that will continue. The name of the game of this for us going forward is, and coincidental with Rob\u2019s presentation today, companies win when they deliver innovation. Companies win when they put that innovation in the hands of growers. And that\u2019s the heart of our licensing model and I anticipate that that will continue going forward. But the content and the nature of those licenses is really the business of the licensees.","Dr. Robert T. Fraley","And I think another key point, Jeff, is that and I truly tried to emphasize that is for us it\u2019s continuing to drive the new innovation. So we\u2019re just within a few years of launching SmartStax PRO with the new rootworm mode of action and then SmartStax stacked with DroughtGard. And as I mentioned in my formal remarks, we\u2019re literally building today the 14-gene stack product in corn that we\u2019ll launch in 2025. And as you mentioned, both Dow and Pioneer and DuPont have been licensees of the technology and we would expect that these will be attractive technologies for the future.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you very much.","Brett D. Begemann","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Looking at the new Dow DuPont entity, could you assess the potential of any long-term competitive threat to Monsanto as well as maybe the potential short-term opportunity as they combine the businesses and there is a normal natural disruption?","Hugh Grant","I can\u2019t really speculate. They are big. I think this makes them the biggest in the world, but as Rob said they are also a customer. So we will continue our licensing efforts with them. There\u2019s clearly going to be a disruption how you bring two entities of this size together but I think that\u2019s really more for them to comment on than us. We\u2019ve talked since last spring we\u2019ve talked about continuing to focus on our core and as the industry as a sector goes through a tough time, you need to double down on that. We\u2019re managing our costs but at the same time we\u2019re not shorting on innovation. And I think we are more successful in that innovation drive than anyone else in the space, so I kind of like the cards that we hold. But I think there\u2019s going to continue to be consolidation in this space when you see what\u2019s happening with commodity prices today. I think we will continue to have a role in being a consolidator and I also think that we will drive to continue to be the partner of choice. And as long as we have that innovation pipeline then we will be in a very, very good position in both of those vectors whether it\u2019s consolidation or maintaining our position as the technology partner of choice.","David Begleiter","Thank you. And one quick thing for Rob. Rob on wheat I noticed the projects did not advance this past year. Can you discuss what\u2019s happening with the wheat programs and timeline as well?","Dr. Robert T. Fraley","Yes, thanks for the question. So we continue to work in developing wheat and I\u2019d say we\u2019re taking a pretty broad approach. We\u2019re applying a lot of the same marker-based and genome sequencing technologies in wheat that we\u2019ve applied in corn. We\u2019re doing the microbial testing, looking at seed treatments both biological and chemistry in wheat. And we\u2019re starting to look at the climate models for both nitrogen and other weather-related apps for wheat, in addition to the core effort that we\u2019ve had in biotech primarily focused historically on wheat and insect control. So, wheat is an important crop. We continue to look at R&D opportunities and to develop them.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Roberts","Thank you. I think price lift has never been above 10% globally when foreign exchange is relatively stable and I\u2019m sure it varies by region, but you said Brazil is now running about 10% in the first quarter. Do you think you can go above 10% in local currency in some of the devalued markets?","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, I think the \u2013 this is Brett. Good morning. I think what you\u2019re looking at in Brazil is clearly an impact on currency. So we attempt where we can to use pricing to offset some of the currency devaluation that we face. And Brazil is a good example of that where we pushed it to 10. And we will continue to look at that in Brazil as we go into the second season there as well as into next year. So there are clearly opportunities. It\u2019s hard to speculate whether or not it could ever be above 10 because then you\u2019re \u2013 you got to take into account what\u2019s the current situation, what\u2019s the market competition look like and then you\u2019re speculating on what currency is going to do. But we always look for every opportunity we can to leverage our price to offset the currency.","John Roberts","Have you ever gone above 10% in any other markets?","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, there have been times when we have been above 10% and we\u2019ve been close to mid double digits in some markets where we saw a significant acceleration in the marketplace. And again it varies. When you\u2019re in a market that\u2019s high demand for corn and you have high commodity prices, you have more latitude than when you\u2019re in a situation today where you have depressed commodity prices. That plays a huge role. But yes, we\u2019ve been higher than 10 before.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","Brett D. Begemann","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us with the rate of spend in climate and where that\u2019s going? And on the same topic, where are we in the nitrogen advisor rollout? We met several farmers at your own Investor Day who didn\u2019t have access to it yet but seemed to want it.","Pierre Courduroux","Yes. So as far as the rate of spend is concerned, we are still \u2013 as part of our planning in terms of expense, we are still investing in climate but as part also of our efforts and the way we\u2019ve been managing spend and the way we anticipate to manage spend in this challenging ag environment, we were also very cautious on the way we do that. So this is still an investment that\u2019s growing but proportionally to the prior year, we were not growing as much definitely and we will be very diligent in not starving the efforts but also being very fiscally responsible in how we are managing this investment. From a market perspective, Brett, maybe you want to comment.","Brett D. Begemann","Yes. We started in we\u2019ve referred to it as the I states, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, southern Minnesota with our models. And this year we\u2019ve expanded that fairly dramatically to include big parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska, Missouri down to Kentucky and we intend that we\u2019ll expand it again next year. So we today have a pretty good majority of the corn growing area in the U.S. is covered by the nitrogen advisor but we\u2019ll continue to spread it out. And as Rob noted, we\u2019re looking at other crops and how we expand it to other crops as well is nitrogen behaves the same way regardless of what crop is growing above it. We just need to get the models put in place to make those recommendations for other crops.","Mark Connelly","Is that a long lead time to get those other crops in place?","Brett D. Begemann","No, you\u2019re looking at a year or two to get the models worked out.","Hugh Grant","It\u2019s pretty fast, Mark. And with the elevated \u2013 with the terrible elevation in rainfall and precipitation and the mild winter, there\u2019s a lot of interest in the product.","Mark Connelly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning. I was going to start-off with Happy New Year but I think happy 20th anniversary on Roundup is even more impressive.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Frank Mitsch","Just a quick question on the productivity program. Obviously, three months ago you announced 12% reduction in the workforce and you\u2019re upping that target here today. I\u2019m just curious what may have changed since then? And as you got into the program you start to see more or in what areas might it be, if you could add a little more color there that would be helpful.","Hugh Grant","Yes, Frank, thanks for the question. So this has been a work in progress. So as we build the plans and get more granular in the detail, we\u2019ve gained in constant. So today is the final tranche of this. Brett mentioned a few of the areas that we\u2019ve been working on. Brett maybe worked on the commercial hub, so that\u2019s probably one of the biggest changes for us and going to these four regional hubs.","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, we started on a path targeting 300 million to 500 million and we had the first tranche in October and this is the final piece of that. And what we were building out is the commercial hubs and we needed to put those in place to be able to define the opportunity. And it really gives us the opportunity with these four hubs to think about how we create centers of excellence for various processes that we have within Monsanto that we\u2019ll drive through those commercial hubs, not unlike what we\u2019ve been working on with our supply chain and in R&D with the R&D hub in Chesterfield that we\u2019re building out, out there. So it\u2019s really a focus leveraging data analytics and process improvements to drive our innovation faster and to drive our customer service to a higher level.","Hugh Grant","And Rob, maybe a word on the R&D side.","Dr. Robert T. Fraley","Yes, so Brett mentioned we\u2019ve created a center of excellence now with our Chesterfield site. And if you\u2019ve been on the tour recently and I know you have, you know how we\u2019ve expanded that. But that\u2019s given us also the ability to close some of the smaller sites, move people and focus our efforts. We\u2019ve done other focusing efforts. You\u2019ll recall in November we announced that we would be exiting sugarcane, we\u2019d be streamlining our yield and stress program and changing the R&D approach. And then finally one of the big efforts has been, building on Brett\u2019s comments, is using the digital ag tools to really change how we do our breeding and our field testing using a lot more data inputs to make those decisions. And those have had I think very big, very important and very significant impacts on improving how we do the research.","Frank Mitsch","Terrific. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much, Frank.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning, fellas. Two quick questions. The first is just should we think about the Dow DuPont deal altering what our out-year Xtend in soybeans in the U.S. numbers should be? And then just the second one is on the slide that you showed the five geographies where you plan to hold or increase market share and corn, could you kind of rank those which ones you have the most confidence in and maybe which ones you\u2019re going to have to fight the hardest to hit those numbers?","Hugh Grant","Duffy, good morning. Thanks for the questions. So on Xtend, I don\u2019t think it changes the out-years at all. So we don\u2019t see any shift in that projection. And then in the five areas if you were ranking them, Brett?","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, I think you find yourself in a different situation in every one of those countries. We have a strong position in the U.S. but we also have really strong competitors in the U.S. And you don\u2019t see big changes in market share very often in those size of markets but we continue to win there and little by little grow. When you look at places like Eastern Europe where you have improving genetics replacing really old genetics from before not as strong a competition, we can get pretty healthy gains there and we have over the past five years. And that\u2019s leapfrogged us into the number one position over there. And then of course in Argentina as an example we have a really strong position in Argentina and we never give up on our opportunity to grow. But I\u2019m thrilled every year that we hold that position down there because it\u2019s a really strong position. And in Brazil we find ourselves in a unique situation right now where our competitor is challenged with a trade offering in the marketplace. And quite frankly we\u2019re getting an opportunity to grow there. So we\u2019re taking advantage of that and growing our footprint. And that\u2019s the part of the confidence we have in the summer season that we had improvement this year. So each market is going to be a little different but we feel good about our position.","Duffy Fischer","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Laura Meyer","Adam, ","Hugh Grant","We\u2019ll probably make this the last.","Laura Meyer","Yes. Adam, we\u2019ll close after this question from Joel please.","Joel Jackson","Thanks, Laura. Just about Dicamba again, I don\u2019t think Dicamba still has Board approval. Maybe you can give an update on your thinking on that? And just some thoughts also on why the Chinese producers down the road won\u2019t compete as hard on Dicamba as they are on glyphosate. Thanks.","Hugh Grant","Yes, so I think we covered some of the approval comment. You\u2019re right, we\u2019re awaiting on two approvals, we\u2019re waiting on a Chinese import approval and the final approval from EPA for the over-the-top spray. The second piece of your question just tell me again.","Joel Jackson","Just why Chinese producers down the road won\u2019t really ramp up on Dicamba and compete just as hard as they have in glyphosate over the past year.","Hugh Grant","We think that they will. I think with the investments that we\u2019re making, we\u2019ll be about a quarter to a third \u2013 we think this is going to be a very, very substantial product. We think that our manufacturing will maybe cover a quarter to a third. But we anticipate that we\u2019ll see Chinese and Indian producers stepping up and we expect that we\u2019ll be running some partnerships in this product as well and frankly we\u2019re going to need that. So we would welcome that competition because the volume off-take I think is going to be really, really significant.","Joel Jackson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much. So I think Laura maybe I\u2019ll just quickly \u2013 maybe quickly wrap. So I wanted to begin by thanking you for your patience. This is always a slightly longer call for us but I think like all good things, it\u2019s worth waiting on. So it was worth taking the time with Rob\u2019s pipeline review. I also want to thank you for your support.","So I think today we\u2019ve covered in a number of ways the breadth, the depth and the productivity of our pipeline and why that gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well as the strong role that we believe we play in addressing the evolving landscape across agriculture within a sector that\u2019s changing at the moment.","So with the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology that we have in hand to create the 9 to 14-gene stacks that we believe will define the future agriculture that Rob outlined today, we see ourselves in a position of strength in a dynamic industry.","So I guess the bottom line for us is we continue to view this as a time of opportunity where a balance of innovation which is kind of the heart of who we are and discipline can grow our long-term competitive position.","So thanks very much for joining us on the call this morning. And the very best to you all in the new year. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"14816":["Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call January  7, 2015  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Laura Meyer - IR","Hugh Grant - Chairman and CEO","Brett Begemann - President and COO","Pierre Courduroux - CFO","Rob Fraley - CTO","Analysts","Don Carson - Susquehanna","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","P.J.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Ms. Meyer, you may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Christine and good morning to everyone. Happy New Year to all of you joining us for this first quarter earnings update.","I am joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer as well as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO and Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Priyal Patel and Tim Boeker.","Our first quarter call continues to be the first data point on our business for the year and includes the annual update of our R&D pipeline. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.","We have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis, where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the Company\u2019s actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.","First and foremost, let me anchor today's review on a brief overview of our first quarter results as shown on Slide 4. Our first quarter ongoing EPS was $0.47, which is ahead of the expectation we outlined with our full year outlook and earnings flow at the beginning of the fiscal year.","Our free cash flow for the quarter was $969 million, which is within the range of expected operating and investing cash flows built into our full year guidance. Both measures are consistent with the growth plans we have for fiscal year '15 as well as our ongoing commitment to continue to invest in our new platforms.","So with that, let me hand it to Hugh for the strategic view at the close of our first quarter.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Laura and Happy New Year to everybody on the line.","While many in the industry are more near-term focused, we continue to keep our view on the horizon unwavering on our vision for growth. We acknowledge that there are near-term headwinds in the current agricultural environment, yet with our balanced portfolio, we believe we're well positioned to withstand those challenges.","Taking a longer view, we continue to view agriculture as a very attractive space given the continuing long term demand projections shown on slide 5 and our commitment to innovation that so effectively aligns with that trend. With annual projections for corn and soybean demand increasing by an estimated $500 million and $200 million bushels respectively in each of the next five years, the world will need considerably more yield.","This scenario is already playing out in the very near term corn environment for the estimated oversupply of 700 million bushels is being quickly whittled away with recent USDA estimates for corn demand increasing by nearly 300 million bushels in just the last six months. Through our innovation, we are uniquely positioned to deliver the yield that this demand requires. Innovation has propelled our growth to date, and we expect the trend to continue for years to come.","Our R&D pipeline is critical to maintaining that momentum, and today I am pleased to say that this year\u2019s annual update from Rob will once again highlight significant progress. We continue to maintain the deepest, most valuable pipeline in the industry providing six fully operational platforms including three new transformational growth platforms as shown on slide 6.","Breeding, biotechnology, and crop protection form the foundation of the core R&D efforts and continue to deliver a yield performance advantage across our key crops and regions as well as the next generations of weed and insect control in the industry\u2019s most productive biotech platform. Beyond this course, there are three transformational new growth platforms beginning with microbial seed treatments and our BioAg Alliance, RNAi pest-control solutions via our bio-direct platform, and finally our evolving Climate platform which is the ability to integrate all of the platforms through the application of digital agriculture.","So while the rest of the industry promotes one-off solutions, we stand alone in our ability to advance technology that powers an integrated approach to improving yields and helps the grower reduce inputs. Today, it\u2019s about more than the update of our pipeline as critical as to our future. It\u2019s also about providing insights into where we stand in our current year and long term plans.","And even though our first quarter is financially a smaller quarter, it\u2019s one in which we deliver on critical milestones that reinforce the outlook for Fiscal year \u201915 and more importantly, the key drivers of our five-year plan to more than double our ongoing earnings per share. First and foremost, if you look at slide 7, we expect to be above the high end of our target of 10 million to 12 million acres of Intacta in South America with a record second year ramp.","Secondly, we received USDA recommendations for deregulation for both Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans and Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton and that brings us a step closer to the planned launches. Third, the US order book indicates that there is likely continued acre shifting this year as soybeans are well ahead of the prior year pace while corn was tracking at a slower pace. This points once again to the power of a balanced portfolio to better withstand the year-on-year vagaries of agriculture.","Importantly, the overall order book confirms that our grower customers continue to seek out our newer, higher-value seed, and trade offerings. And last but certainly not least, we remain diligent on our capital allocation targets, and the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase which is the initial step in our two-year $10 billion of share repurchase authorization, which continues on pace. So across the board in this opening quarter for fiscal year \u201915, we\u2019ve touched upon every critical long term growth driver, and we\u2019ve made significant progress in key milestones that will propel us forward.","Overall, our performance in Q1 reinforces our confidence, and on slide 8, we are confirming our ongoing EPS guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share, albeit against a near term backdrop, this is increasingly more difficult. The currency and acreage headwinds that we faced in fiscal year \u201914, they remain and yet we stand firm in our ability to grow while we are investing in new platforms in this environment, but we won\u2019t get ahead of the business as the most significant seasons in the northern hemisphere are yet to come, and so I will hand over to Brett to provide further insights on our performance in Q1 and how we see the year shaping up. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thanks Hugh and happy New Year to everyone. Our first quarter results came in ahead of guidance with excellent results from Intacta in Brazil. While it is not a perfect hedge, overall our soybean portfolio will help us withstand what appears to be a more discernible global acre shift to soybeans from corn more so than we had originally anticipated. Our balanced portfolio has never been more important or more of a differentiator than now, and I am pleased to say that the decade of the soybean that began with a record year in Fiscal year \u201814 remains in full swing.","Our plan to more than double ongoing earnings per share by 2019 is anchored on more than $4 billion of gross profit growth we expect in our core businesses as outlined on slide 9. Milestones critical to this growth began in our first year. Let\u2019s start with our fastest growing growth driver, soybeans. We are off to a great start with Intacta as we now expect to be above the high end of our range of 10 million to 12 million acres across South America, and our early read on product performance has been quite strong.","Our value proposition held as growers embraced the technology across multiple growing regions in South America as shown on slide 10, and in parallel with the second year of commercial ramp up; we expanded our production of varieties for 2016 from roughly 66 varieties to more than 100 varieties in Brazil alone. This allows us to prepare for an even more meaningful ramp in year three when we expect to be able to serve all of the maturity zones in the country.","Fiscal year \u201916 then becomes the tipping point for broad scale adoption of the technology, and a 100 million acre opportunity in South America. Beyond Intacta is the continued step up of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the US. The early read on our US soybean order book is very strong and we expect growth in soybean acres this season that we are well positioned to serve.","Rob will highlight the performance which really cements this as the platform of choice in the US and as the foundation for our next generation technologies. With regards to Roundup Ready Xtend, the next generation weed control technology layered on the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform, we are making excellent progress in our precommercial activities with an unprecedented bulk up of varieties planned this summer.","As shown on slide 11, our class of 16 has been selected and we now have an impressive 63 varieties across our brands and corn state\u2019s licensees covering all maturity groups and six times the number of varieties for the launch of Roundup Ready 2 Yield. This looks to be the largest biotech trait launch in our history. Receipt of the USDA recommendation to deregulate in December was a critical milestone and now we look forward to the next steps in the US on import approval processes. ","Let\u2019s move to the corn next which is expected to deliver two of our billion dollar plus gross profit drivers in our five-year plan. Quite simply, here is what I think about the state of our business. Our corn yield performance advantage has never been better. Our go-to-market strategy is far reaching and fundamentally sound and the combination of the two resulted in leading positions we delivered around the globe in fiscal year \u201914 as shown on slide 12.","We ended the year in number one position in nearly every major corn market including the US, Brazil, Argentina and Eastern Europe and within Western Europe, we earned a respectable second place as we performed well in both the Grain and Salvage markets. This global performance sets us up well for continued momentum in fiscal year \u201915 albeit on a smaller acreage base and this is where I take a very clear-eyed view.","The long term demand fundamentals for corn and soybeans are intact. Our products are best-in-class, however the currency and acreage headwinds from fiscal year \u201914 continue into fiscal year \u201915. First, in Latin America, the corn acres were softer in Q1 than we originally anticipated with Argentina down an estimated 20% compared to last year and Brazil down 10% in the summer season.","In the US corn business, the order book indicates a downward trend from the prior year pointing to the expectation of lower corn acres and what many now believe appears to be a protracted purchasing cycle given the ample corn seed supply across the industry. We do however continue to see demand for our newer hybrids on our portfolio and a continued trade up to the reduced refuge family of products.","In addition, our orders for DroughtGard Hybrids are nearly sold out in some regions following a year of very strong performance which is particularly compelling given the favorable growing conditions from last year. And finally, in the Ukraine, with our strong corn product performance, we moved to the number one share position this past season but with the unfavorable political climate and the economic disruption, it now appears likely that acres will be reduced in that region.","Despite these headwinds, performance remains the most important variable that a grower considers when making his seed decision and we are still expecting growth in our Corn business for the full year. From a combination of share gains and price mix lift in our portfolio, we remain disciplined in our commercial corn strategy and we are leveraging our strong next generation soybean portfolio to mitigate some of the near term acreage headwinds in corn.","Before we leave our core growth platforms, let\u2019s take a quick look at our cotton business. Precommercial plans are well under way for Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton in the US with the potential for a limited introduction on roughly half a million acres in FY\u201915 pending receipt of regulatory approvals. Pricing will be announced closer to the selling season and will be influenced by the timing of the receipt of the remaining US regulatory approvals.","Ultimately once growers are able to experience the benefits of the full system, we believe the value of the improved weed control in Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton system will allow for a mid single digit step up in price per acre. Finally, Australia wrapped up its critical first quarter at about half of its prior year performance as expected simply because of fewer planted acres as a result of less water and a highly irrigated market.","Let\u2019s move on to Ag productivity. In Roundup, we continue to maintain our strategy of pricing at a small premium over the generics which have held their pricing in the market through the first quarter. We do however continue to plan for an approximate 10% decline in roundup gross profit as we guided at the outset of the fiscal year.","This is primarily driven by price with a modest offset from the increase in branded volumes expected to be sold in Q2 and Q3. Moving beyond Roundup, as we anticipate the launches of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend systems, we recognize that the industry will need an additional Dicamba to meet the requirements of a platform that will have a fit on nearly 200 million acres.","To ensure the success of this platform, we are developing our strategy to ensure there is an ample supply of Dicamba for US in our new Roundup Ready 2 Xtend systems. We have plans in place for formulation expansions over the course of the next several years at our Muscatine plant to produce XtendaMix and Roundup Xtend with VaporGrip formulations and finally we are simultaneously evaluating options to either source externally and\/or build internally for the active ingredient.","We will continue to evaluate our own novel chemistry solutions, those of our partners as well as current and emerging capacity in the industry. That balanced approach gives us confidence that our growers will experience the value from this technology and drive the fastest growing portion of our soybean - or of our business soybeans. I\u2019d like to close up the business overview with a look at our newest platform Climate on slide 13 which we expect to be a meaningful contributor to our gross profit by the end of our five year plan.","Consistent with the integrating principles of the platform, we folded our former FieldScript and precision Ag equipment products under this climate umbrella and now plan to offer a host of digital Ag advisory services from this platform. Under this new umbrella, our key priority continues to be to increase our active users in our Climate Basic by 50% to an active base of 45 million acres.","In addition, we are now targeting to double the acres of Climate paid premium services for products like Climate Pro and FieldScripts from a base of more than a million acres in Fiscal year \u201914. Both targets support our strategy of driving trial and on-farm use for what we believe to be a high valued system integrating technologies. To further drive this adoption and trial, I am pleased to announce that we recently signed long-term distribution agreements with Growmark, Helena and Winfield and extended our operating agreement with Agrium's Crop Production Services and with Wilbur Ellis.","Their commitments to distribute our climate advisory services through their combined retailers and selling agents who touch nearly every acre in the US acknowledges the potential of this technology. Their local agronomic knowledge and expertise along with our technology is a powerful combination and will better serve our grower customers.","Our first quarter is solidly behind us underscored by the delivery of several key milestones that propel us into what looks to be a very promising long term plan. I can assure you however that we are keenly focused on delivering fiscal year \u201915 while we continue to invest in our newest platforms. Our global reach, our balanced portfolio and our innovation will continue to serve us well. With that, I will pass it to Pierre for the financial update.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks Brett and good morning to everyone joining us in the New Year. Even though Q1 represents a smaller portion of our earnings, there are several indicators that confirm our confidence in our full year business performance and allow us to confirm our initial EPS guidance range of $5.75 to $6 per share as shown on the slide 14.","First, soybeans in the South America came in better than expected in Q1 and Intacta performance now appears to be above the high end of our range of 10 million to 12 million acres.","Second, our US order book reflects delayed pharma decisions and are shifting acres from corn to soybeans. So accordingly, our prepays are down but with our balanced leading portfolio, we are well positioned to manage the variability across the acres and that has been the case in prior years. For every 1 million acre shifting from corn to soybeans in the US, we see roughly a 3% decline in our earnings per share.","Third, crop protection was above expectations through the close of Q1 largely due to timing and finally we were very disciplined in the management of our spend in the first quarter. However, with the backdrop of expected lower corn acres, we now expect our total seeds-and-traits gross profit growth percentage for the year to be more in the range of high single digits.","Our next generation of soybean technologies will be a core driver in delivering this growth with a key proof point coming from the more than $100 million in gross profit growth and the seven points of margin lift that we saw in soybeans in Q1. We also continue to see full year growth coming from corn from a combination of share gains and price mix lift despite the decline in gross profit in the first quarter.","This decline in corn gross profit in Q1 was largely South America volume driven but we also experienced higher COGS from a combination of items including the higher cost of inventory resulting from the flood in Argentina. This was further compounded by the continued effect of the price reduction we took last season in our corn trait in Brazil which was in direct response to a leading competitor\u2019s price drop as a result of their Corn Borer Resistance issue.","Finally, we do see currency as a continued headwind. We factored into our guidance the headwind of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 which was roughly the same rates of the evaluation we experienced in FY\u201914 and despite continued strengthening of the dollar. Again several of our key currencies including the Brazilian Ria, Argentina Peso and Euro, at present we still believe this is adequate.","This brings us to the next financial measure to weigh in for the year which is our operating spend. First, we remain committed to incremental spend in our climate and biological platforms to ensure that we deliver on the long term growth prospects for these opportunities.","But to ensure the incremental spend is available for the new platforms and to address continuing headwinds in the business, discipline plans are in place and we now expect our core operating spend to be flat to slightly down which was already reflecting in our first quarter results.","Let's move next to how our projections play out by quarter. Following a stronger than expected first quarter and with what now appears to be lower corn acres, we now estimate that Q2 EPS will be down in the range of 5% to 10% versus prior year, leaving growth for the year to Q3 and Q4, the latter of which ranging from breakeven to positive.","With a chance to ship brand direct to farmers in the U.S., we now expect a shift of approximately $200 million to $300 million of gross profit from Q2 to Q3, which we expect to be partially offset in the second quarter by the continued growth in our soybean platform in the U.S. and South America.","Finally, our cash flows for the quarter were on target, and as outlined on Slide 15, we still expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, reflecting a more normalized level in FY '15.","Our $6 billion accelerate share repurchase remains on track and is expected to close some time in the third quarter, giving us a net boost in our earnings per share we indicated after considering the interest on the incremental debt we took on to fund this repurchase.","We began the year with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of $1.2 billion and we continue to target being in the range of $1.5 billion, maintaining the capital allocation strategy we outlined just six month ago.","As expected, we're seeing significant headwinds in fiscal year '15, but we also see confirmation of the long-term growth drivers that support our gross profit expansion through a global balance portfolio.","When combined with our disciplined and balanced approach to funding our growth platforms and our continued commitment to effective capital allocation, I am confident we're on track in the first year of our five-year plan to at least double our ongoing earnings per share by 2019 and effectively return value to our owners.","With that I will hand it over to Rob to provide us with this year's annual update on our pipeline.","Rob Fraley","Thanks Pierre and good morning to everybody on the line.","Over the last couple of years, I've talked to you about the evolution of our pipeline where we're able to enhance yield from more angles than ever before.","If you go to Slide 4 of the annual R&D pipeline update presentation, which by every measure, this is the deepest and most valuable pipeline in Monsanto's and the industry's history.","First, we've graduated from the days when the pipeline reflected just breeding and biotechnology. Today our R&D approach marries our core pipelines with three transformational growth platforms, allowing us to talk about a truly integrated approach to yield.","Second, this is a pipeline that consistently delivers progress and sustained ways of advancement. I would like to highlight the breadth and the quality of this progress on Slide 5. So let's begin with the core platforms.","First, we've made significant progress in our next generation of weed control platforms and both soybeans and cotton as underscored by the recent USDA recommendation to deregulate around the ready extend systems.","Second, we've made several advancements in highly relevant disease resistance breeding trades in corn and in vegetables while continuing our impressive breeding performance advantage in corn, soybeans and cotton.","Third, we now have several next generation insect control products in Phase 4 including the advancement of our third generation of above ground insect control in corn.","Fourth, we have an exciting new seed treatment nematicides advancing in crop protection, our first drive from the application of genomics to chemistry. And not to be outdone in our new growth platforms, we're delivering upgrades across the advisory services in climate, we've delivered our first Phase 2 product in BioDirect and we advanced 50 microbial hits to Phase 1 in the BioAg Alliance.","I think put quite simply, we're seeing incredible progress across several dimensions of our pipeline across multiple crops and both core and new platforms and that's important because it defines the commercial opportunity. So not only is this the broadest pipeline, but it's the most valuable, reflecting up to 25 billion in peak sales opportunity from the core alone.","As shown in Slide 6 to 8 and considerable upside potential coming from our new platforms. I think it goes without saying that this is our competitive advantage. There is a steady wave of innovation that delivers meaningful solutions to our farmer customers to improve their productivity and grow the value of our commercial portfolio.","So let's start with the core platform updates to show you how that works. Breeding is clearly our cornerstone. Monsanto's biggest commercial advantage comes from the differential performance created by the leading breeding engine in the industry.","If we move to Slide 9, I am pleased to share with you that for more than a decade, DEKALB has been delivering a yield advantage of seven to ten bushels in the U.S. across a gamut of growing conditions and for and for the second consecutive year, DEKALB has reached record levels of yields north of 220 bushels per acre with a strong performance advantage of nearly 8 bushels per acre.","I could not be more pleased with the sustained superior performance of our U.S. corn breeding program. And moving to Slide 10, this yield advantage is not limited to the U.S. In Brazil, we see an advantage of 5 bushels per acre in the Tropical hybrids. In Argentina the advantage continues to exceed 10 bushels per acre and finally in Eastern Europe, the advantage is similar to that of the U.S. with a 7 to 10 bushels advantage.","Let's look at soybeans next on Slide 11, which is the single largest core gross profit driver in our five-year plan. For the fourth consecutive year, we saw more than a 4 bushel advantage in Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans as compared to roundup ready varieties.","This performance cements the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform and establishes it as the foundation for the next generation technologies like Roundup Ready 2 Xtend.","Finally the real proof of the performance is the wide spread adoption of the technology. In 2014, across our branded and licensed customers, the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform expanded to 53 million acres in the U.S. an increase of 10 million acres in just one year.","Moving to cotton, our leading Deltapine cotton varieties on Slide 12 demonstrate nearly 70 pounds of lift per acre performance advantage for the fifth consecutive year. This leadership across the three primary crops grown in the U.S. gives us the opportunity to withstand the inevitable shifts between acres like no one else in the industry can.","Moving to Slide 13, let me share with you some of the highlights into the recent advancements in breeding technology that we expect to allow us to widen our competitive advantage. First we pair the largest and most diverse germplasm library with industry best discovery technologies utilizing advanced high throughput screening and advanced markers.","And then we factor in the biggest global testing network to identify, select and deploy the best performing seeds across the globe. Further the application of data science and advanced algorhythm allows our breeders to focus on the highest probability segment of our germplasm library.","Our recently announced $20 million investment into global integrated breeding centers further leverages these advantages. Through genome-wide selection, built on a foundation of 15 years of market research, we will be able to do yield testing in the lab, significantly increasing the size of our screening program and enable complex trait stacks and new genetics at the same pace.","By 2018, we expect our new hybrid testing should be more than six times our current rate. This capability provides the horsepower to upgrade our global germplasm portfolio every year, allowing us to introduce new higher yielding seeds and it allows us to unlock specific targeted breeding opportunities.","So let's look at how our breeding engine is making significant breakthroughs in our disease resistance program. Today I'll share insights into two of the advancements in corn disease depicted on Slide 14 as well as in our vegetable program on Slide 15.","Gray Leaf Spot and Goss's Wilt Resistance are significant diseases in the United States and can cause catastrophic losses upwards of 30%. With this year's launch of improved Gray Leaf Spot resistant and Goss's Wilt Resistant germplasm, we're helping to mitigate those risk for our grower customers.","In our 2014 R&D trials, we demonstrated an impressive 30 to 40 bushel advantage in low to high Gray Leaf Spot disease pressure environments respectively and our Goss's Wilt Resistance research trials were even more impressive with resistant hybrids demonstrating a 50 to 100 bushel per acre advantage over the susceptible varieties in low to high disease pressure.","For vegetables the advancements are in our two largest most valuable crops; tomatoes and peppers. In peppers, we're launching Phytophthora-resistant peppers. Our new resistant hybrids demonstrated an increase from six to 11 tons per acre of production in our R&D field plots.","In tomatoes we're advancing bacterial wilt resistance tomato to Phase 4. Tomato bacterial wilt is a disease that affects tomatoes in hot, humid growing conditions and in 2014, our bacterial wilt resistant tomato hybrids demonstrated nearly an 80% improvement in yields reinforcing the advancement decision.","Let's move now next to our biotech platform, which continues to be a significant differentiator with our focus on third and fourth generation upgrades that we expect really to define the next decade. In fiscal year '15, we're planning for a limited introduction of Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton on approximately 0.5 million acres pending receipt of regulatory approvals.","As seen on Slide 16, this system will provide outstanding control of resistant and tough to control weeds, making it a step change in weed control. To further enhance grower's experience with the technology. In 2014, we trained over 3800 growers, retail partners and stakeholders on key areas such as weed management and application systems.","This sets up the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system is soybeans as shown on Slide 17 and 18, which combines the benefits of breeding, biotechnology and crop protection into one seamless system of outstanding week control.","With the USDA recommendation to deregulate, we continue to work towards a planned 2016 commercial launch. We just completed our deployment process at the yield performance of this extend class of 2016 is on parity with the latest class of Roundup Ready 2 Yield varieties and spans all the maturity groups in the United States. This is an amazing accomplishment for a planned first year launch.","Switching to insect control, with the advancement of our third generation of above ground insect protection to Phase 4 this year, we now have four next generation insect control technologies in Phase 4 as shown on Slide 19.","By the end of the decade, we expect to launch all of these products from SMARTSTAX PRO across the Americas to our second generation of Intacta for South America and these target some of the most significant pest in agriculture.","Our third generation of above ground insect control in corn adds a mode of action for Fall Armyworm and corn earworm and expands the spectrum of control to black and Western bean cutworms, all on top of the proven performance of our VT Double PRO.","Further it has a target market across the Southern U.S. and Brazil where insect pressure is top of mind. We understand the criticality of continuingly upgrading insect control to anticipate the evolution of the insect population.","The other advancement in insect control I would like to highlight on Slide 19 is cotton lygus control, now in Phase 3. This product is the first to target a piercing, sucking insect and it is expected to be commercialized stack with Bollgard III XtendFlex.","Through our field testing, it continues to provide excellent control of lygus, thrips and leafhoppers and it's expected to significantly reduce insecticide use in cotton production systems where farmers are sprained for lygus between five and 10 times the season in the delta.","Within yield and stress, we're adding DroughtGard SMARTSTAX PRO, our first broad acre drought project to Phase 3. This product combines 10 different biotech genes to bring the benefits of improved yield potential in water stressed conditions from our DroughtGard gene and drought resistant germplasm with the benefits of our third generation of below ground insect control from SMARTSTAX PRO.","In head to head comparisons in fiscal year '14, as shown on Slide 20, we saw more than a 5 bushel advantage from DroughtGard hybrids as compared to competitive drought products.","Our ability to marry our proficiency in breeding technology and biotechnology is allowing us now to expand DroughtGard hybrids beyond the Western Corn Belt with a market fit on nearly 25 million acres across the broader U.S.","Although the work in yield and stress is clearly complex from a technical perspective, the strong grower interest and market need demonstrated by our DroughtGard hybrids performance highlights the importance of our long-term collaboration on yield and stress with BASF.","Moving to our final platform in the core crop protection, we recognize that to fully serve our customers with integrated yield solutions, we need to selectively provide in-season control of pests, whether through our longstanding Roundup franchise, our emerging Xtend system or through novel new solutions.","Today I'll highlight one of several of our advancements in crop protection. This is an exciting new nematicide seed treatment that just moved into Phase 4. So nematodes are a persistent pest across several crops, with annual losses estimated to be nearly $3 billion.","On Slide 21, I am pleased to share that there is highly novel seed treatment has demonstrated broad spectrum control of nematodes in corn, cotton, soybeans and has promise for vegetables as well. Our 2014 trials demonstrate a yield advantage of 6 bushels per acre in corn and an advantage of 2 bushels per acre in soybeans when compared to the competitive standard.","And most exciting, this demonstrates the first ever application of genomics insight into the synthetic chemistry use in seed treatment. We expect this technology will be a key component of our Acceleron seed treatment portfolio as well as attract licensing interest from numerous third parties.","From breeding to biotech and crop protection, our core platforms continue to deliver sustained ways of innovation that translate into advancements that power our growth both near term and longer term and with three fully populated new growth platforms, I believe we will continue to lead well into the future with these transformative technologies.","So shifting to our new growth platforms, I'll begin with microbials. With the formation of the BioAg Alliance with Novozymes just under a year ago, the progress has been truly impressive. With our collective microbial discovery field testing capability and fermentation production expertise, no one has as compelling a capability as we've assembled in this alliance.","Together in our first year, we conducted over a 170,000 plots across hundreds of strains and as shown in our first-ever pipeline for the BioAg Alliance on Slide 22, we've generated 25 hits in soybean and hits in corn moving into Phase 1 for BioYield. This really demonstrates the power of the field testing capability on our footprint with the explosive expansion in trials in year one to unveil these hits.","Further with a combination of Monsanto and Novozymes, we already have two projects in Phase 2 of early development as well as numerous current commercial products from optimizing soybeans to Torque for corn and those existing products continue their global expansion leveraging Monsanto's footprint.","If we move to Slide 23, we can see the results from our first year of collecting testing. The average yield advantage in the top hits in corn was four bushels per acre and in soybeans was two bushels per acre.","In 2015, we plan to move to 500,000 plots and thousands of strains, leveraging our industry leading field testing network to bring scale to microbial testing that's simply never been done before.","An additional untapped new growth opportunity is underway with our breakthrough technology in our BioDirect platform on Slide 24, where we're developing new topically applied RNAi based tools to target plant disease, insect and week control as well as targets that enhance bee health.","This year, we have our first BioDirect concept advancing to Phase 2. This first advancement of early development is a non-transgenic topical technology with broad acre potential in the control of Colorado Potato beetles which infest numerous specialty and row crops and are particularly devastating in potatoes.","On Slide 25 you can see the latest field trial data, demonstrating that the BioDirect solution has insect control efficacy results closely aligned to the chemical standard as well the technology demonstrates reduced levels of larval infestation and plant defoliation.","One of the keys to the success of this platform will be determined by our advances in the area of production technology. Since the announcement of this platform, we have already driven an 80% improvement in the cost of production of RNAi, which is significantly below current market rate.","You know of all of our platforms, this is the one that reminds me most of our early days in biotechnology, where the application of sound breakthrough science ultimately delivered game changing sustainable solutions for improving yields and reducing inputs in agriculture.","Rounding out our new R&D growth platforms is the opportunities with the climate platform. Through the application of data science and precision agriculture, this platform has the unique ability to integrate all of our technology platforms connecting farming as has never been done before.","With a rapid innovation cycle, unlike our other technology platforms, our pipeline phases on Slide 26 reflect this higher pace, aligning more with software engineering than our traditional core platforms.","With only a little over a year since the acquisition, we've already integrated key existing products and services to provide greater unique value and more unified service offerings to growers including the combination of software, connectivity, in field solutions and equipment.","As covered in further detail on Slide 27, in 2015 the nitrogen advisor for corn producers is expected to incorporate our newest best-in-class soil hydrology model and our over winter simulation of soil temperature.","These upgrades in addition to other unique features improve the estimates of nitrogen leaching and volatilization allowing farmers to more effectively track and manage their field nitrogen levels.","Our Climate PRO service in 2015 will also incorporate newly enhanced satellite imagery feeds that increase the frequency and analytics to improve usability and accuracy of the service allowing farmers to more quickly and precisely identify and treat infield pest, disease, water and fertility issues.","Software as a service is a new domain for Monsanto, but the application of the data science to our extensive field trial and genetics data is allowing the development and application of unprecedented value creation for agriculture delivered through software.","I'll end as I began, by every measure this is the deepest and most valuable pipeline in Monsanto's history and in the history of the industry. This is our competitive advantage. We alone consistently deliver sustained waves of advancements across a breadth of platforms, crops and geographies and we bring those to the market with an impressive commercial reach.","So thank you. I'll turn the time back to Laura for the Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks Rob. With this extended conference call to accommodate the R&D update, we've planned for some additional time for questions as well. With that we now like to open the call for questions.","As we typically do, I'll please ask that you hold your questions to one per person so that we can take as many as questions as possible. As always you're welcome to rejoin the queue for follow-up.","Christine, I think we're ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Due to time constraints, we ask that all callers limit themselves to one question. If you have additional questions, you may re-queue and those questions will be addressed time permitting. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. Rob, a question on Roundup Ready Xtend. On Slide 18, you talked about how the launch is going to be bigger than even Intacta was this year at 12 million plus. Can you sort of size that and more importantly talk about sort of the value proposition for the grower and in terms of dollars per acre and how much you intend to capture of that value proposition?","Rob Fraley","Thanks Don and Happy New Year. So, let me begin with the first part, and I'll let Brett talk about the value side of it. So with the extra time we've had in the breeding program, our breeding team has done a terrific job.","As I highlighted in the talk, we will have probably six plus times the number of varieties that we had with our original round of Ready 2 launch, and importantly those will cover the U.S. geography literally going from the Canadian Border down to Louisiana and the yield performance of those varieties is truly exceptional.","So, we've use our time carefully to breed and advance the trade. We'll be using most of this year's summer season for seed scale up and ramp up, so we expect the potential for our largest biotech launch.","Brett Begemann","Yeah good morning Don. This is Brett. Just adding a little color to the \u2013 what Rob already described about 63 varieties that we will have available for bulk up this year, which is really unprecedented for us. We will use that as an opportunity for show and tell across the market with our farmers and we need another round of evaluation with them to get a look at what the overall value creation is going to be for the product. It\u2019s really clear there is high demand in the market, there is challenging weeds out there, the farmers need help in controlling.","The product has a great fit for that, but we won\u2019t get ahead of ourselves on looking at pricing until we have this last big opportunity to take a look. That being said, as we look at extending cotton this year, we will have a few 100,000 acres out there this year that we will look at in cotton, and you know, I still think once the system gets fully valued by a farmer, he has to see it throughout the year. We are thinking in mid-single digits values on cotton, but we will get a chance to look at that this summer in the south.","Don Carson","Okay. Thank you.","Brett Begemann","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Hi, thanks and good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about Intacta and the upside that you are seeing this year. Where in particular is it coming from, meaning is it coming from the large corporate farmers?","Are you seeing better buy-in than you anticipated from the smaller guys you probably had less visibility from in groundbreakers, and just on top of that, could you just talk a little bit about - it sounds like you are going to be unlimited in terms of supply for next year. So how should we be thinking about sort of reasonable range of acreage potential for next year?","Hugh Grant","Yeah. Vincent, thanks for the question. I think at this stage, I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty much across the board. We don\u2019t see the difference between the big corporate farms and some of the smaller ones. I think we are seeing the performance and the buzz in the market has really listed interest across the whole range, and I mean, we will be unlimited next year I guess.","Vincent Andrews","Yeah, as we look at next year, I think the third year has a history of being the year when we have the opportunity to go pretty big, and so I\u2019ve mentioned in the prepared remarks, we will have over 100 varieties next year which really covers the entire Brazilian market. We will also be expanding in Argentina, but primarily it will be driven by Brazil. So that gives us the opportunity to expand pretty rapidly.","I look back at our history with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and with Intacta, we have been tracking every year about double what we were able to do. So if you go back and look at the third year of where we were with Roundup Ready 2 Yield, in the midteens, you know you start looking at that for next year being able to double that for South America, I kind of think that\u2019s a reasonable range to be at.","We will know a whole lot more when the harvest comes in and the multipliers have harvested their seed, and they get the varieties and we quality check et cetera. That\u2019s all stuff to come yet, but I think it\u2019s reasonable at this time to be thinking in that kind of a range.","Hugh Grant","Just one last add-on not to belabor it, but you know, what\u2019s also exciting is we have the second generation of Intacta ready to go by the end of the decade and that\u2019s going to be important both continue to differentiate the pipeline well into the next decade but really give us a better tool for a durable insect resistance management.","Vincent Andrews","Yes. Good point. Thanks very much.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort","Thanks very much. Pierre, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the billion dollars you expect to see in the corn business over the next few years. It seems like you\u2019ve been stuck in the mud a little bit here in the last few years without getting any growth in those earnings, but can you talk more specifically how you are going to do it and then do you think you will go back to that 5% to 10% price mix list over that horizon to get you there?","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, but thanks for the question. I would say, I think the headline in this is I am very - I continue to be very bullish in corn. I think that when you look at the corns that we hold today, I wouldn\u2019t trade any of them for anybody else. I think we are in really good shape in corn. It\u2019s been a challenging year, but this is - but the issue that we are facing really is reduced acres.","If you look at performance, you look at the velocity and your hybrids are being picked versus some of the older ones in our order book, and I continue to feel bullish in corn and then if you look to the long term by actually the next season or two, we think that there is going to be a continued acceleration on demand, so the pile that has been built at the moment, the amount of grain that\u2019s out there.","If you look at China coming on, the increased demand for DDGs coming out of China, you look at Ethanol. When you combine that with a crimping of acres in Latin America, I think we are going to see pretty rapid draw down as well Bob. So I am pretty optimistic on how we see corn playing out.","Rob Fraley","Yeah I would just add that I echo \u2013 that I feel really, really good about our Corn business and I am really confident that the pile is shrinking at an accelerating rate and then I look at where we sit. We got the best performing portfolio we\u2019ve ever had, we\u2019ve got the strongest position in all the major corn markets in the world that we\u2019ve ever had.","We\u2019ve got a year that\u2019s really challenging that we are faced with this year but our footprint is still growing. Our Corn business will grow even though acres are down substantially that we are seeing this year.","So I still feel really good and I look specifically at \u2013 to your point on can we get price lift, absolutely. We are getting price lift this year and this is a really tough environment and you mentioned a couple of years of having that challenge and corn has been coming down for a couple of years and then I think the one -- the factor that often gets missed is, when a farmer doesn\u2019t plant corn, they still plant the acre and most of the time, they plant that acre to soybeans and particularly so in the U.S. and developing in South America.","We have a great hedge. It\u2019s called soybeans and when I plant soybeans, we have a great soybean portfolio that\u2019s really starting to kick in and we saw that last year as acres started to soften in corn.","We saw it with Intacta kicking in, we are seeing it again in this year with Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the north and I think we will see that even more with Xtend kicking in. So it\u2019s a great hedge.","Pierre Courduroux","Just as a precision\u2026.","Robert Koort","Right.","A \u2013 Pierre Courduroux","Actually regarding the hedge that Brett mentions, during my read of the prepared read market said, 3% declined for each million acres in EPS. This is $0.3 not 3% just to clarify things here.","Robert Koort","Good clarification yeah.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Brett, can you just discuss what you are seeing this year for farmers as they may not trade down on corn seed but definitely a little more careful? And just on the corn share issue, Hugh, can you confirm that you were flat in US corn share last year and you expect to be flat to up this year?","Pierre Courduroux","Yeah if you look \u2013 if you look at the trait down, what we would say based on the order books so far Bret, we continue to see growers looking for those newer and better performing hybrids even in a really tough year.","I think they have been a lot more careful and a lot more measured and they have been slower in that purchase process than we have seen in previous years and I\u2019d see in most world areas as we came last year and Brett mentioned this in his prepared remarks, we either held our standards to the number one position in pretty much every major world market Bret with the exception of Western\u2026","David Begleiter","Yeah.","Pierre Courduroux","Western Europe. I don\u2019t know if you would add anything to that.","Brett Begemann","No I think you covered it well. The farmers are \u2013 you know farmers are in tough spot. You know with the commodity prices what they have done and we have tried to be considered of that in working with farmers and you can completely understand the indecision that they are going through.","They know there is a big supply of corn out there so they are not forced to make a decision. They are still trying to make the trade off on how many acres of corn and beans we are going to plant and the good news is, we are in a great position to supply corn or soybeans.","What we see in our order book right now is a lot of strength in soybeans not only from increased acreage but also what we believe to be shared growth and we see a lot of strength in our corn orders albeit lower because of acreage being lower but they are buying our newer hybrids as we would have anticipated.","So I feel good that by the time they get planted, it will be in a real good place and then as you step back and look at this over the longer period, we are in a really good place to continue to grow our core business and I think we are very much on track for our five year plan to double our earnings because corn is a big chunk of that and we are in a good place to do that.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","A \u2013 Pierre Courduroux","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Good morning.","Pierre Courduroux","Hi.","Brett Begemann","Good morning.","Jeff Zekauskas","In your release you spoke about keeping your overhead spending on a base level flat and you have some new product initiatives. So I was wondering how much you expected your overhead to rise in absolute dollars this year and secondly, in your results your inventories were up about 10% or about $400 million year-over-year even though your sales were down about 10%. Can you talk about what is going on in your inventory levels?","Hugh Grant","Jeff, thanks for the two questions. I am going to say a few words and Brett has led a lot of this effort. We\u2019ve taken a really disciplined view on our expanses given the fact carmakers have contracted and we\u2019ve seen a pull back on commodity prices.","We have been talking about that across the organization and the teams have been really, really responsive to that. So it\u2019s a sensible thing to do and the business knows a size where we do have that leverage but to your point, we\u2019ve been really careful that we don\u2019t short future growth as we look at managing our day-to-day expenses. So you know that the old analogy of seed corn is a life in well. So we \u2013 this is a pipeline review.","We continue to spend on future growth and the anticipation demand. The market saw reflection, the demand will eventually overcome two years of bumper harvests and that we will see those things pulled up again but we're leveraging SG&A. And Pierre, maybe a word on expense and on the inventory?","Pierre Courduroux","Yeah and obviously we are monitoring our expenses right now and adjusting as well to the evolution of the business we don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity but right now, we were thinking about base business as our base spend as basically flat to slightly down knowing that we are also investing as we mentioned earlier on in our two new growth platforms of microbials and the climate platform but as far as our base business is concerned, we are definitely taking a number of actions just to make sure we are in a good place there.","So the way we think about it right now and it\u2019s going to evolve over the year but flat to slightly down is the way we think about the core of our spending. As far as inventories are concerned, this is the combinations of two things that have led to those increasing the inventory at the end of the first quarter but the first one is obviously I mean as you know in South America, with a reduction in acres.","We sell less than we anticipated but more importantly, if you remember over the last two years, we have tried to reveal our inventories and that was the plan from Day one. We wanted to rebuild our inventory in the Northern Hemisphere to be able to face the market and what you see today is these revealed of inventory because over the last two years, we were in a slightly too low positions in terms of inventory.","So those two combined factors is what has led to where we are right now. We don\u2019t have any concerns about those inventory. I mean these are \u2013 the good news about having being short over the last couple of years is, these are very fresh inventories and as you know, I mean we\u2019ve got two to three years to rotate those inventory. So at this point in time, we feel very good about it.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thank you very much.","A \u2013 Rob Fraley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Parkinson","Perfect. Thank you. Regarding the Intacta ramp up for next year, you mentioned you planned to have over a 100 soy varieties next year in Brazil alone. Can you offer a little more color on what regions those are in? Are those mostly existing states where you have a large presence and it\u2019s more penetration or some of the newer ones and then also a quick update on Argentina would also be appreciated? Thank you.","Brett Begemann","Yeah good morning Chris. I will talk first about Brazil and then \u2013 and a little bit about Argentina. So first of all as we are going from what we had roughly 66 to 100. So call it an additional 30 varieties. I think you should think about it as they are spread across the entire market. So in areas where we were weak or didn\u2019t have varieties to introduce, we will have new varieties.","So it will look a whole lot like the first year or second year of Intacta in some of the core areas and then in the core areas like the big Midwestern market if you will of Brazil in the South, it will be adding to the portfolio. So a farmer is going to have more choices of more varieties in those areas but it will be evenly disbursed as we move across.","So the new areas we are going into still be short on varieties. The areas we\u2019ve been in for a couple of years, they are going to have a lot of choices to make in Brazil. In South \u2013 in Argentina, we are really \u2013 I look at Argentina as we are starting to ramp up in the Northern part of Argentina, that feels and looks a lot like Brazil and similar varieties et cetera. In the central part of Brazil, it\u2019s \u2013 maybe call it a little bit of an expanded groundbreakers. We don\u2019t have a lot of acres there and a lot of varieties.","We had to build those varieties and get ready to go there and as you know, we started slower down there. So we are still working on that. Most of it\u2019s in the north, the product performance has been really good in the northern part and we are just now getting a good look at it in the central part because the central part of Argentina is a little slower as you can \u2013 from a planting standpoint. They don\u2019t plant till later in the year. So we are just now getting a good look at it and everything looks very good.","So I am excited about Argentina. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a year or two behind Brazil.","Chris Parkinson","Thank you.","Hugh Grant","So with a delayed start in these markets, we are moving more varieties earlier than we've ever done before.","Rob Fraley","Absolutely and that\u2019s kudos to the breeding team that continues to ramp these faster than we\u2019ve ever seen, being able to bring those in and it really helps the farmer given the farmer choices. So they end up placing these varieties appropriately in the farm.","Hugh Grant","Yeah.","Chris Parkinson","Great color. Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Hugh Grant","Good morning P.J.","P.J. Juvekar","So I know you don't break out the exact acres of corn with grains, doubles, triples and SmartStax. But can you qualitatively talk about what you are seeing in each product? And then secondly, just related to that, you've got drought tolerant corn in its second year, what would be the bottom line impact of drought in 2015?","Hugh Grant","P.J. Thanks. Thanks for the question. As Rob mentioned drought so we started small with our drought products. We know the luxury of doing head to head comparisons with other products in the industry and we\u2019ve seen really, really stellar performance which has I think we will continue to leverage as we bring in the SmartStax platform as well as it peaks across the \u2013 as it peaks across the country but Rob maybe a word on\u2026","Rob Fraley","Yeah just a little bit more detail on what\u2019s going on there P.J. and a Happy New Year. We \u2013 we originally planned DroughtGard to be a western corn belt product and it was largely populated in our double Pro background.","We\u2019ve been so pleased with the performance of the product and there is a great deal of interest from the grower community. I think Brett mentioned in his talks that we are basically sold out of DroughtGard that we have made a decision to breed the DroughtGard trait into our core Midwestern genetics into what would be a DroughtGard SmartStax Pro combination and I mentioned in my talk that will be a Tangent Biotech trait stack.","So it\u2019s a great feed of both breeding and molecular breeding to make that happen but there is a lot of interest among Midwest growers to have that drought protection and one of the things we saw this year that was so important for us was this was not a droughty year across the corn belt and we saw outstanding top end performance from our DroughtGard hybrid. So that interest and those results are what's enabling us to make the decision to expand it across the Midwest.","Brett Begemann","So P.J. this is Brett. Just a little bit to color on the portfolio on how we look at it. Here is the way I would frame it. Now that we\u2019ve been at this Refuge reducing family for a number of years now. Triples continue to shrink, doubles and SmartStax continue to grow and I would anticipate that that is exactly how it will start to shape up. Farmers that have significant inside pressure are looking for multi-trades to discourage resistance.","Those that don\u2019t have a lot of pressure, they are in the double. So that\u2019s why you keep seeing SmartStax grow and double pro grow and triples will get smaller.","P.J. Juvekar","Well. It\u2019s good \u2013 good summary.","Brett Begemann","Thank you, P.J.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes good morning. A few questions on Roundup Ready 2 Xtend. Historically, if we look at your new trait launches. I think it\u2019s fair to say the P&L impact in the launch here has been rather small due to low acreage and the launch cost.","I am wondering how the increased scale of the Xtend launch might alter that equation. Perhaps you could comment a little bit on the net effects there and then second, if we look a few years down the road, to what extent might potential success of this product displays demand for glyph sate and if that\u2019s material, how do you plan to manage through that?","Rob Fraley","Yeah. Kevin, thank you. The first year I think will still be also be small and we\u2019ve learned over the years that first year, the name of the game in that first year is farmer trial, farmer exposure and making sure that the grower has a really great experience with a new product.","So it\u2019s -- the P&L impact in that first year I think is small but the goodwill and the experience that we build really is the fly feel that generates growth in the second and third year and this one will be big. There is a lot of pent up demand there.","So if here goes Intacta, there goes XTend. It\u2019s going to be a similar kind of ramp and Glyphosate \u2013 I mean it\u2019s \u2013 yeah I think the way I look at it Kevin is I anticipate that every acre that has a stand will have Roundup on it because Roundup still controls most of the weeds out there and the value of XTend is going to need to help the farmer with the whole system controlled, more difficult to control weed.","So I am not looking at it from the standpoint of how much round that gets displaced. I am actually looking at it from the standpoint of how much more roundup gets sold as a system in the XTend system where the farmer is getting superior weed control across his cropping system.","Kevin McCarthy","Great. Thank you very much.","Rob Fraley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Connelly","Thanks. You touched on the issue of pest evolution earlier and farmers in Brazil are telling us that they have been surprised at how fast some of the new pests are filling in for the ones you are controlling with Intacta and Bollgard and that they are spraying more than they thought they would.","Does that mean that the value proposition in Brazil is different than it is in the US and does it mean that you need to introduce new products in Latin America faster than you introduce them here.","Hugh Grant","Rob, maybe say few words on evolution?","Rob Fraley","I would say you are exactly on track and that\u2019s one of the reasons I emphasized in my prepared remarks the fact that we now have four brand new insect control techniques in Phase IV.","Clearly in the South America environment where you don\u2019t have the cycle between crops and winner cycle. The evolution of passes is a key challenge and that\u2019s why you know, I always emphasized our focus on not only the success with the second generation Intacta that has another model of action and then literally, we are working on the third generation of Intacta and you know, similarly in corn, having multiple above and below ground.","Technologies will be key for durable insect control in those areas and I think frankly that plays right into our power area. I mean you know, I mentioned all the phase advancements in the pipeline.","We have literally an explosion in our discovery program of new modes of action for insect control that include not only the BT base products but increasingly the RNAi based products that represent a new mode of action and so I see that as both a key enabler for our own seed portfolio but also as a very attractive upside in terms of licensing opportunity to other companies and I think those are very significant. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Sandy Klugman","Oh thank you so. Follow up question on XTend. Could you tell us where you are in terms of receiving import approvals from China and then with regard to a potential XTend launch in Brazil, what\u2019s the outlook for Dicamba Herbicide gaining regulatory approval in the region and that\u2019s exciting?","So we will go through the normal process that you are familiar with will be given final USDA approval, EPA approval will be getting the approval over the top for the chemistry from the variety of states. And then we'll begin the international approval. So we've already received a number of international approvals.","China will be among the last because as we know their process starts later, but we've had great success over the history of our program and obtaining those approvals in a timely fashion just like we saw with Intacta a few years ago, which I think puts us in the position in soybean to support our commercial launch in 2016.","Yes and then in terms of the international opportunities, dicamba is already approved for use in Argentina so that will represent an attractive early opportunity as well as Canada in some of the other markets.","In Brazil we're working closely with our partner BSF to move up the regulatory process and we actually have Intacta 3, which will be the combination of yet another mode of action for bug control, plus the extent trait targeted for about the right past the end of the decade in Brazil. So we're making lots of progress.","We clearly see the -- we clearly see the Roundup Ready Xtend soybean platform as really having the opportunity to fit across the 200 million acre base across the Americas for soybeans and that's really exciting.","Sandy Klugman","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning, folks. I was going to wish you a Happy New Year but thinking that's probably a more appropriate greeting for you guys on September 1, so I will make a mental note of it.","Hugh Grant","Thank you.","Frank Mitsch","Hey Hugh, you spoke about the near-term headwinds in Ag persisting but I guess on a positive front, we've seen corn lift about 20% since your last conference call. Have those headwinds lessened somewhat over the past three months and what would you term would be your greatest headwind or concern as you look out at the Ag environment today?","Hugh Grant","Yes Frank, thanks for the correction on September 1. I'll hold you for that Happy New Year. I just for the record, I mean that it's a tough environment because acres have shrunk but as I said earlier, I am -- we're bullish in agriculture, I am bullish in corn.","And although we've seen two years of bumper harvest and their surplus there, the market inflation and if you look at the drawdown on ethanol, especially with oil prices coming down and more miles travelled and you look at consumer behavior and increase consumption, I think we're going to see a faster drawdown on those demand cost than we've ever seen before.","So between herbicides spilling up, ethanol ramping in China, the recent news on China consume in more DBGs. I am for such a thing as Scottish optimist, I am fairly bullish and I'm fairly bullish on this one. The watch-outs here I mean in terms against that optimism that continued to watch us. ","Rob Fraley","So definitely as Hugh was mentioning, the key question is going to be around the acres and definitely as you mentioned Frank, the evolution of the commodity price over the last couple of weeks has been really helpful, but it's still a late season.","So that's when we're watching extremely closely. The other one from a macro perspective that we're watching and that we've integrated in our thinking obviously is currency. We've integrated $0.15 to $0.20 of headwinds in our projections. We are pretty much there now.","So at present we're in a good place versus our scenarios. However that's something we're definitely watching on a daily basis and something that maybe a further headwind, but so far so good I would say.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Joel Jackson","Hi. Good morning. A question on climate. You had a recent acquisition of 640 Labs. Should we expect similar small dollar Precision Ag acquisitions going forward? And what are the largest gaps you see right now in the current Climate offerings? Thanks.","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the question. Yeah, we will -- I think we'll continue to see bolt-ons. We feel really good with the establishment of the plant forum, and the team in San Francisco has done really stellar work. We're busy on integrating our machinery; the precision piece into climate and the 640 Labs is another extension of that. If you look to the coming year throughout the remaining gaps, there might be a better sensor technology perhaps.","Rob Fraley","Yeah. I mean this is obviously a super exciting area and there's lot of innovations coming and spectral analysis and sensors that we will -- want to participate in, either through acquisition or through partnership.\\","And then I think the other important dimension is the opportunity for international expansion. This is the technology that's going to move very, very quickly driven by grower demand both by large farmers in South America, but small farmers and small holders around the world, and we're going to want to again participate through acquisition or through partnership in that space. And so, this is a transformational technology in agriculture and we want to drive it very hard.","Joel Jackson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Good morning. Since this is a longer-term call, there's two big public policy debates that may be one of you could comment on. One is moving the food labeling out of the states, I mean moving the food labeling out of the states and into the federal regime, and the debate over in Hawaii about production over there as well as some of the testing plots and whether they can do state level regulation versus again moving that to the federal.","Hugh Grant","Now, John, thank you. I'll maybe ask Rob to say a few words on Hawaii. On the labeling piece, we've been really clear from the get-go on this that a voluntary program we would completely support and have done from the start. If there is a labeling initiative, we strongly believe that should be run as a federal program rather than a patchwork quilt where you've got individual state supplying their own benchmarks and thresholds.","I grew up in Europe before we saw one European Union. It's really hard to move good between that community. And my worry would be if you have a disaggregated or a fragmented labeling program, it leads to increased expense and cost of food for the consumer. So, we continue to hope that we see some kind of consistency in a federally applied program here.","Rob Fraley","Sure. Then, regarding your question on the Maui County, a ban on GMO cultivation, just a couple of background pieces there. So, as you know, we filed litigation just before the holidays, which I think will be decided somewhere in the late spring or early summer.","We're very confident that we'll prevail in that and a large part of that confidence is based on the fact that similar actions have been upheld in both Hawaii and India, the big island, and basically deal with the fact that these are federally approved products and that states and counties can't ban.","Just a couple other things, just to maybe add a little bit more color since we do have the extra time. First of all, in an absolutely worst case scenario where we didn't prevail, which like they said we expect we do. I just remind you that the research that goes on in Maui is our early stage breeding program, so there'd be really no term -- near-term disruption on the breeding program and particularly our commercial efforts.","Hawaii is a special place where we can plant corn most days during the year. It would be difficult and expensive to replicate, but there are other parts of the world that we could make the decision to invest in and advance. But I don't expect that to happen because I think we've seen the precedence set from the past litigations, but thanks for the question.","John Roberts","Thanks and happy New Year.","Rob Fraley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","George D'Angelo","Hi. This is George D'Angelo on for Laurence today. Just with the new price point on Climate, can you sort of outline the strategy? Does it sort of gain as much share as you can early on or -- and then how do you eventually raise price?","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, I think you just summarized i8t George, its drive and grow experience, build an exposure to the platform and I think once we have growers there and they become believers then we can continue to add value and bring more and more functionality to the platform.","So Rob talked about the nitrogen advisor and a bunch of what the teams have been doing this year, I think that becomes the next big add-on to those programs.","So it was very much of a grower experience and kind of what we talked about earlier on expense. I am making sure that growers really appreciate and built trust and confidence in the platform.","George D'Angelo","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Piken","Yes, hi. Good morning. Just wanted to dig a little deeper in terms of the channel and the shift. I understand you guys are moving maybe about $200 million in expected profits from 2Q into 3Q.","But how do you see channel sort of evolving over the next couple of years as a percentage of your corn and soybean seed business and how much of this is being driven by your desire to grow the Climate platform and interact more directly with the farmers?","Rob Fraley","Thanks for the question. We've done a lot of work with the channel team in the last few years and I guess you would see the performance has never been stronger. We feel really good about our position with our channel brand in the U.S.","The way I always look at this is our goal is to sell farmer seed the way farmers want to buy seed. Not the way we choose to sell it and that's why we have a large retail presence with out DEKALB brand. It gives that choice. We've continued to evolve the channel brand, which has really found its place in the marketplace and it's getting stronger every year.","Yes, we do expect the channel brand to continue to grow and growers is a larger part of the market. As I think about it from the relationship with Climate, Climate creates a whole new relationship with the farmer on its own and I think what's important to think about what climate is, it has the potential to be the integrating force across the entire portfolio of all 40 decisions that the farmer makes, regardless of whether we sell the seed or the crop protection etcetera, there is a systems approach there that we can participate in.","Of course we will do our best to have the best hybrids and the best choices with trades etcetera to be part of that integrated package with the famer that we would be selling and Channel will fit right in the middle of that, but climate goes well beyond our own seed footprint.","Laura Meyer","Okay. And I think we're right at time with that. So we want to be respectful of everyone's time. I am going to pass it over to Hugh for some closing comments, but thank you for all the questions today.","Hugh Grant","Yes, thank you. Thanks Laura. So as Laura said, thanks very much for joining us on this extended call this morning. this has became a tradition where we updated the pipeline every single January.","I would say there is no doubt that the first quarter affirms our confidence and our 2015 opportunities. More importantly it reinforces the confidence that we have in our five-year plan to at least double our ongoing earnings per share as we delivered on several key milestones including a record second year ramp with Intacta and continued progress towards our capital allocation target.","Beyond this year with the R&D update that Rob walked us through, you can see that we're in a better position than ever to deliver sustained waves of innovation across our multiple platforms and geographies and that's innovation that delivers value to our grower customers and our owners. And quite simply that sets us apart in this extraordinary Ag space.","So from the team here in St. Louis, all the very best to you and yours as we start this New Year. Thanks very much for your support.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you. Mr. Hurley, you may begin.","Bryan Hurley - Investor Relations","Thanks a lot, Kevin and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings update. As usual, I am joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer as well as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Tim Boeker, and Laura Meyer.","This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company\u2019s actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today\u2019s press release.","So, this morning, we have built our update around the opportunity we see for Monsanto\u2019s long-term growth, including some key announcements around our growth targets, our strategy and the next important step in our capital structure. While we will focus on our longer term growth horizon, let me anchor the conversation with a couple of key results on Slides 4 and 5. Ongoing earnings for the quarter were $1.62 per share. And with those Q3 results in hand, we have the clarity on the remainder of the year and we have raised our outlook to the upper end of our original guidance range for ongoing EPS and free cash flow affirming our full year growth this year. With this quarter, we continue to see our Seeds and Genomics segment as the largest contributor to that full year growth and we continue to make incremental progress on our overall GP contribution, margin expansion and in our ongoing EBITDA.","So with that, let me hand it to Hugh to take us through the updates this morning and the next steps in our strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bryan and good morning to everybody on the line. While we always take a look forward in Q3, today we take a bolder approach. Most importantly, we are defining our growth strategy over the next five years and we are beginning to truly use our capital structure more aggressively. In the last year and a half, we have crossed several key business milestones that give us a new level of clarity and confidence and how we see our global growth over a multi-year runway. We have just completed an update of our strategy. The clear conclusion, we see a unique combination of core growth, new platforms and the opportunity to better leverage our capital structure. There is a lot of news in our announcement today.","Let me walk you through each element starting on Slide 6 and tie the headlines to my strategic priorities for our company. First, we are unlocking the next evolution in our strategy. We are not simply a seed company. Today, we are providing multiple solutions to farmers by delivering improved yield technology and the seeds in the bank and in the fields. That translates to a compelling vision of how this industry can expand yields and productivity through the convergence of biology, technology and information.","As farmers become increasingly digitized, information on specifically platforms like precision agriculture becomes the integrator expanding from our core seed business to create opportunity to optimize yields across the 40 plus key decisions that farmers make every season. There is no company better positioned to lead this evolution. That\u2019s who we are. And just as we led the seeds revolution, we are driving the industry to expand the view on how we deliver yields and productivity to our grower customers.","The second point I would emphasize is on Slide 7. With such a compelling vision, we are willing to back our confidence and long-term growth with a new target to at least double our ongoing EPS over the next five years. We haven\u2019t laid out multi-year targets for the past several years. Doing so today is evidence of the confidence that we have in our core business and the transformational potential in our growth platforms. It\u2019s also backed by our focus in our farmer customers and the success that we have had over the past few years as farmers have responded well to our effort to provide more options in value with better performing products.","We believe we have positioned ourselves to sustain the mid-teens plus EPS growth, that\u2019s been our hallmark through a full decade. The ability to target continued growth at that level of a revenue base in the range of $15 billion speaks to the debts of the Monsanto portfolio and the magnitude of the opportunity that our strategy unlocks. The foundation of our confidence is our core business. And as we have listed that outlook to the high end of the guidance range today, we see as an important proof point. Our core business performance is allowing us to deliver our growth commitments and the toughest ag environment in the past several years. Within that, corn certainly has been more challenged by the industry headwinds of declining acres, a tougher commodity environment and direct currency effects, but it\u2019s still a source of expected full year growth in our portfolio.","With some of the macro shifting, soybeans have emerged as a true fiscal year \u201814 highlight delivering record growth that foreshadows the opportunity ahead in the decade of the soybean. So, despite a year where commodity price is reset, corn acres declined in the world\u2019s biggest regions and global currencies became a significant headwind. There is no hesitation. We see seeds and traits delivering a majority of the full year growth to back our guidance. And that performance is a key proof point of our portfolio balance that turns into opportunity as we see this core seeds and traits engine delivering more than $4 billion in total GP growth as the largest driver in our five-year target.","The third key point I would emphasize is on Slide 8, our plan to return an additional $10 billion to our shareowners over the next two years, which is another important expression of our confidence in Monsanto\u2019s long-term growth. Today, we have announced a major step forward that allows us to use the strength of our cash generation and balance sheet. We are now targeting a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5 by the end of fiscal year \u201815. That level would reflect the seasonality of our business, but importantly, it takes our balance sheet from a negative net debt position to one providing an opportunity to use our capital structure and return significant cash directly to shareowners.","Over the past year and a half, we have been working in this plan as we have passed several key business milestones and we move quickly to get to our target level. One of our first capital allocation priorities will be a new two-year 10 billion share buyback program with an expected accelerated share repurchase of approximately 6 billion in the near-term.","And that leads to my final point, with everything that we have assembled today, the roadmap for our growth is as clear as ever. Brett will describe this in detail, but our future growth is enabled by three key elements. We are a global company that has strong embedded organic growth, where a company that\u2019s building transformation on new platforms with compelling growth prospects and we are a company that now intends to use our powerful cash generation and capital structure to compound growth and key value for our owners.","One of the most exciting elements of that as we are now a pivot point for our new platforms start to deliver real growth. These are platforms that we expect will form a key part of our earnings profile in the next five-year period. And this will be one of the focal points of our summer field event as we host our Whistle Stop Tour VII this August. The springboard this year has actually exceeded our initial plans as we have more customers and more acres on all of our Climate Corporation platform products and services. That in turn provides an early confidence point for the ramp up over the next few years for what we see as a transformational platform.","We will outline our specific expectations for the fiscal year \u201815 outlook as we closed out this fiscal year, but fundamentally, we certainly see fiscal year \u201815 as the beginning of the next half decade of growth. At no point have we this much clarity on both the opportunity ahead as well as on the roadmap that gets us there. We are a company that sees growth five years down the line and that\u2019s compelling. We have the strategy, we have the tools and we are focused on delivering.","So with that, let me give the time remaining to Brett to give you the deeper dive into our business platforms.","Brett Begemann - President and Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Hugh and good morning to everyone on the line. Our confidence in committing to a long-term growth target is a function of both our core business and the new platforms to strengthen our growth opportunity. On Slide 9, you will see that confidence has increased as we have delivered a handful of critical milestones over the past year and a half. Those range from the reinvigoration of our soybean platform with the launch of Intacta and our agreement with DuPont to the establishment of new growth platforms in precision ag and biologicals. Those milestones set the roadmap to our growth on Slide 10.","We believe we have de-risked some of the biggest factors crystallizing our line of sight on what drives our opportunity. That obviously has a start in fiscal year \u201814. It is clear that what we needed to demonstrate this year was that our seeds and traits business is returning as the biggest driver of our growth and that\u2019s on track.","As we walked through the elements, let\u2019s start with corn. Despite continued softening across the macro environment, we expect corn to be a source of full year growth and part of the seeds and traits rebound. That\u2019s highlighted by the most strategically important drivers. We are seeing good price mix lift driven by our portfolio upgrades in all regions and we have seen the COGS improvement we anticipated highlighted by the U.S. That\u2019s even more meaningful in a tougher macro environment. For perspective, this year, corn acres have come down in the Americas by about 5% and currency reflects an incremental headwind to our business of roughly another 3%. Those factors have tempered some of the upside growth this year, along with continued volatility in the Ukraine and some incremental effects in Latin America. There was widespread rain and flooding in Argentina that has significantly reduced our production yields, resulting in much higher costs in the current sales season. Likewise in Brazil, our largest competitor has acknowledged it had some challenges with insect resistance to its key traits making some late pricing adjustments across the current market. Those are all realities of the current macro conditions.","We work through variations every year. We have made our adjustments and we feel good that our global corn portfolio allows us to continue to grow even in a year like this. Our portfolio clearly positions us well for some of this macro shifting and you see some of the corresponding positives in soybeans, where we are on track for record growth this year. That includes both the pure pickup in the core business as planted acres favor soybeans as well as the compounded benefit from drivers that we expect to elevate the earnings power of this platform over the next few years, notably Intacta in Latin America and the overall Roundup Ready to Yield platform in the U.S. The rest of the portfolio is effectively where we expected and complementing the bigger corn and soy engines.","In cotton, there has been a little pickup in U.S. acres that offset a bit of the declining acres in Australia. And in vegetables, we are now tracking with the turnaround in revenue and gross profit contribution we anticipated for the full year. Delivering in this tougher environment pressure tests our strategy and validates the value of our portfolio and that culminates in how we see our growth setup for the next five years. To be clear, we expect the largest driver of our overall opportunity through 2019 is growth in the core seeds and traits business. In that time, we expect to deliver more than $4 billion in new total gross profit growth.","There is a no better example of that opportunity and earnings power than the emergence of the soybean platform on Slide 11. It\u2019s a platform with the fastest expected rate of growth in the next five years. With the progression of Roundup Ready to Yield, Intacta and Roundup Ready Xtend, for the first time, the soybean platform mirrors the multi-stack rapid upgrade opportunity in our corn business.","The most visible proof point is Intacta on Slide 12. Today, we take the early step in what we see is the fastest historical ramp of any soybean trait. The full supply availability is still coming together as weather has delayed harvest in Argentina and we work through the qualification process given the end season drought in Brazil. So, while it\u2019s early, we are very comfortable being able to target 10 million to 12 million acres in the upcoming season. That\u2019s our biggest second year step up in soybeans. It\u2019s three to four times the reach of this year\u2019s launch and twice the level that we saw with the ramp up of Roundup Ready to Yield in its second year. That\u2019s a clear validation of Intacta\u2019s performance and the opportunity.","The majority of this next year\u2019s expected step up will be in Brazil, but we will also begin commercial launch across Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay passing another key strategic milestone in this 100 million acre opportunity. That catalytic opportunity in soybeans is backed by the continued growth and expansion we see in our biggest platform, our global corn business. More than half of our seeds and traits revenues are driven by corn reflecting the opportunity across multiple layers and multiple geographies. This is an extension of growth we have proven for the past decade, including portfolio upgrades, our expanded footprint and continued trade opportunity all of which drive our mix and volume.","The biggest factor in that opportunity is on Slide 13, our ability to leverage our industry-leading breeding program to upgrade our portfolio every year in every key corn growing region. There is real power in this significant steady engine across our biggest business. There is also a multiplier effect on Slide 14 as we use that same breeding engine to expand our opportunity as we target new high growth markets that drive volume. Today, it\u2019s playing out in areas like Eastern Europe, one of our fastest growing corn regions this year despite the political unrest in the Ukraine. That\u2019s the kind of opportunity that allows us to be on par this year with our record volume years even as acres have shrunk in key markets in North and South America. That core growth in seeds and traits is complemented by our ag productivity segment. Going forward, we continue to see ag productivity as an important strategic support for the seeds and traits growth. And while it\u2019s likely there will be some variability in any year, we see this more in a support role than as a growth driver itself.","My final area of emphasis is on what I think will be one of the most significant incremental drivers and that\u2019s our Climate Corporation platform on Slide 15. This year is a pivot point. We have some important proof points this year that increase our confidence in the ramp up to what we see as a 1 billion acre runway and a $20 billion market opportunity. As farms are increasingly digitized, precision ag can become an integrating point for information, seed, equipment and other inputs.","One of the most important areas of progress on Slide 16 has been in building out that platform. In the short time, since our Climate Corporation acquisition, this partner opportunity has been a highlight beginning with our early collaboration with WinField. We also have agreements with additional anchor partners, including Agrium\u2019s Crop Production Services, GROWMARK, Wilbur Ellis and Helena as well as our first equipment partner, CNH Industrial. Including Monsanto, this is a base with more than $60 billion in total annual sales. And just as importantly, these are partners that touch virtually every corn and soybean acre in the U.S. in some form. That reach can help us take the next step in building an industry platform that makes precision agriculture a bigger tool for our farmer customers.","The next validation point is the interest in the suite of products in our Climate Corporation platform. The response has been far stronger than we anticipated. We wanted to see Climate Basic get a foothold as a free service to build exposure and interest and we believed if we could validate that on 20 million acres, it will be a strong year. As of the end of May, we had more than 40 million installed acres were total acres for all accounts and more than 30 million of those acres are active users using the service in the last 30 days. That means nearly 1 in 5 acres of U.S. corn and soybeans are enrolled giving us an account base that represents an important foundation for expansion and active usage that demonstrates the practical value on the farm.","We also entered the year planning for groundbreakers like experience on premium services like Climate PRO targeting hundreds of thousands of acres. The response has been equally good in this area. We now anticipate the premium offerings will be used on more than 1 million acres across the U.S. corn belt this year. We know this is just a start, but these milestones are a springboard that we expect to move us from an investment platform this year to a real earnings contributor in the next few years on to what we truly believe is a multi-billion dollar long-term opportunity.","Let me bring all these points together. We have passed a number of key milestones in the past 18 months. Those give us greater clarity in our growth outlook for the next five years. Those drivers come directly from the success we have had over the past decade reflecting a strong growing core and new platforms that draw on our powerful technology, Headstart. And that\u2019s both a source of confidence and the point of focus as we target the compelling opportunity in front of us.","So, with that, let me hand it over to Pierre.","Pierre Courduroux - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Brett and good morning to everyone. As CFO, my priority is to have a clear view of what drives growth and how it translates into the financials. So, let me give you the highlights from today for financial lengths. Number one, our growth plan builds on the strong growth we have delivered in our business over the past few years continuing that momentum. And with our improved outlook today, we are on track to both deliver our bottom line guidance and to affirm seeds and traits as the biggest contributor of that full year growth.","Number two, setting a multi-year target underscores our confidence in our continued opportunity. I take a prudent approach to our guidance outlook. So, establishing a long-term metric is a reflection of our confidence in our core business, a compelling strategy and a clear view on the factors that drive growth. And number three, having served as several key milestones in our business, we are now well-positioned to better optimize our capital structure. Given the strength of our current balance sheet and our confidence in our growth prospects, we have decided to take advantage of the favorable debt market. By the end of FY \u201815, we intend to target the net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5. And one of the ways we will immediately put that structure to work is through a new 10 billion share buyback authorization, which includes our intent to use 6 billion in the near-term through an accelerated buyback program.","I will cover how we will use our capital structure in more detail, but before I do so, let me anchor on the business performance in the current fiscal year on Slide 17. With the visibility from Q3, we now expect to be at the upper end of our original ongoing EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. With one quarter left, we have good clarity in delivering that updated range reinforcing our growth even in the challenging macro environment and with roughly $0.15 to $0.20 EPS impact from currency headwinds. Q3 came in somewhat better than we projected during our Q2 call with ongoing EPS of $1.62. That relative performance came across the P&L and includes some timing benefits from the core business, operating expenses and taxes.","If you look at the quarter on a year-over-year basis, as expected, the most direct factor in the comparison was the significant tax benefit that increased Q3 in 2013 and did not repeat this year. As we expected, the corn quarterly gross profit contribution was down versus last year primarily as a function of the reduced acre base both for the U.S. season as well as in Latin America, where Safrinha sales also carry into our third quarter. But overall, seeds and traits GP was up in the quarter as continued strong contribution in our soybean business largely offset the timing and acre effects in corn. The year-to-date performance keeps us on track to achieve strong gross profit growth across seeds and traits for the full year marking the biggest overall contributor to our fiscal \u201814 outlook. Through Q3, we have also seen incremental margin improvements in seeds and genomics and within the soybean and corn segments. And that extrapolates to our full year outlook, where we continue to project margin improvement across all three areas.","In soybeans, we will expect another increment of contribution coming from Q4 Intacta sales in Latin America and the second installment of the DuPont royalty reinforcing our full year expectation for a margin increase of 6 points to 8 points. In corn, we have seen very good margin growth in our U.S. business as we have seen the COGS benefit flow through together with the expected gains from our mix uplift. Those benefits have been offset some in Latin America, including the COGS effect in Argentina and the corn pricing dynamics in Brazil that Brett described. For the full year, we expect overall corn margin to still step up, but with those Latin American effects, it will likely come in somewhat lower than our original 3 point targets.","With our updated guidance, we still project a stronger fourth quarter, but given the timing benefit we see in Q3, we now expect to deliver a loss rather than breakeven EPS in Q4. Aside from some of that Q3 effect, we still see the same drivers that reduced the overall year-over-year loss, including the next increments of soybean growth, and uptick in corn as we anticipate less adjustments in U.S. returns and a more typical contribution from our vegetable business. And as a result, we expect to see the last incremental contribution that allows us to get to our full year ongoing EBITDA target of mid to high-teens growth.","If we move to the longer view, our fiscal year \u201814 performance becomes the foundation for how we see our strategy unfolding over the next five years on Slide 18. Working from the fiscal year \u201814 base, we are targeting at least doubling our ongoing EPS by 2019. And I am comfortable that there are multiple sources backing that target, reflecting a good line of sight on the core business, on the new platforms and on the benefit of our capital structure. And the reality is that all those factors should contribute. Likewise, we build our plan on baseline assumptions, so each factor holds the potential to be a bigger relative contributor depending on the different growth trajectories.","We have also left ourselves room to invest for growth, including CapEx to expand our base business as well as for M&A. The single biggest contributor is pure gross profit expansion reflecting the embedded opportunity in the core business. Logically, the biggest source of that growth comes from corn and soybean. These are also complemented by the expansion of the broader portfolio ranging from crops like vegetables, canola and cotton to continue technology development and licensing agreements. We see this opportunity translating to more than 4 billion in total incremental GP, which would mark our largest incremental seeds and traits GP growth in any five-year period in our history.","We also anticipate that the precision agriculture platform will become a meaningful contributor to earnings toward this five-year period. The contribution in the early years is expected to be relatively small, but as that business ramps up, we expect an accelerated contribution. As we look to build new platforms, we plan to align our investments and support them appropriately putting more resources behind these high growth areas and streamlining or redeploying some operating expenses from lower growth business areas.","The performance and operating expense discipline in our core business allows us to make some near-term investments in our new platforms to jump start those opportunities. In FY \u201814, we have invested a little more than $200 million of combined operating expense in precision ag and biologicals. We are planning to run that to an expected level of more than $300 million, $350 million in FY \u201815 as we make investments in the people and infrastructure that reflects our confidence in the earnings potential of these platforms. That is the conscious investment. And while we will step up our spending in FY \u201815, I continue to expect to generate overall leverage from GP to earnings once we passed this initial uptick.","One of the most important elements of our conversation today is our approach to capital allocation on Slide 19. A decision to return an additional $10 billion to shareowners is a result of careful consideration by our teams and the board over the last 18 months as we have achieved several business milestones that provide clarity on our planning and capital allocation. We are targeting a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 by the end of fiscal year \u201815. That\u2019s obviously subject to the seasonality of our business, but fundamentally, we are comfortable with this leverage level. In the spot of our ongoing strategic planning, we will continue to review and recalibrate our capital allocation as appropriate with the goal of remaining both opportunistic and disciplined. At the level of 1.5 terms of debt, we expect to be able to better optimize our cost of capital while balancing a few key priorities.","On Slide 20, our first priority is to continue to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy and drive growth. We have the financial flexibility to pursue both organic and external growth including investments in our business, in technology deals and M&A. We will be disciplined in our use of capital in this regard focusing on opportunities that meet our growth and return criteria. At the same time we are committed to returning capital to our owners and this capital structure affords us the flexibility to deliver further value to our owners with an accelerated buyback program and through dividends. Another important priority is to maintain our strong investment-grade credit ratings to provide access to attractive financing for our long-term needs as well as in season borrowings for our working capital needs.","One of the first priorities of our capital allocation will be on share buybacks. Our Board just approved a new two year $10 billion buyback program. We will use it in combination with approximately $1 billion that remains in our current program. And as an important first step we intend to use the combination in cash and new debt to target $6 billion for an accelerated share buyback which we anticipate beginning in the near-term and completing in about 6 to 12 months. We likewise continue our focus on the dividend as I view that as a priority element of our strategy as the source of direct income to our long-term owners.","With that let me bring this all together. Monsanto is at a unique point in our history. We have the confidence and visibility into our business to talk about delivering growth that effectively spans a decade. That visibility in turn allows us to take the next in our capital allocation. And from there I believe we can the unique combination of organic growth, new opportunities and our business structure to meaningfully grow our earnings, our cash generation and ultimately return to our shareowners.","Thanks and I will hand it back to Bryan for the Q&A.","Bryan Hurley - Investor Relations","Thanks Peter. With that, we will now open the line for questions. As we typically do, I would ask you to please hold your questions the one per person so that we can take as many from as many people as possible. So Kevin I think we are ready to open the line for questions at this point?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Good morning everyone and congratulations on the balance sheet announcement, really well thought out and well done. A question on the corn business, I just want to understand both sort of how to connect what\u2019s taken place this year with sort of what\u2019s underlying the target out to \u201819 and I guess in particular this year is there any issue in terms of returns that you are reserved for in the third quarter because of what\u2019s going on with planted acreage in the North or the recent flooding that you just don\u2019t know what the numbers are and we might learn more about that in \u201914. And then as it relates to going forward as we went through the presentation and we saw some familiar stuff on some of the slides, some of the things that I noticed you didn\u2019t mention that I wanted to understand what your view as going forward was, you have historically talked about the 5% to 10% price mix lift and you had also had a target of sort of $1 billion in sales coming from that, are those numbers still good or are we thinking about things differently now?","Hugh Grant","Vincent thanks for your quick question. I think all three of us will take a piece of this. Let me start by saying we are \u2013 I think corn had a good year not a great year. Beans picked up a lot of that slack, but if you look across the Americas we saw acreage contract and I think a big piece of our numbers reflects that contraction. And I would say even without contraction we see volume about flat year-on-year. So if you step back, I feel pretty good about the corn performance given the challenges, but I maybe ask Brett to say a little bit about the market and then Pierre maybe a few words on returns and how you see that playing out in that piece of mix as well.","Brett Begemann","Yes, thanks. Thanks, Vince and good morning. I think there is a couple of really key points to think about and it is both this year and as we start to progress into next year. First of all, as we mentioned, we have seen hundreds of millions of dollars lost to less acres in currency this year in our corn business, but as we look at the core of our corn business that was offset by our mix gains in the various regions and the significant COGS improvement that we expected to get in the U.S. And in the U.S., we remain on target for those. And as Hugh mentioned along with that, our soybean business is having an absolutely record year driven by course of new products in soybeans and the build out of Roundup Ready to Yield, but also the portfolio advantage we have is those corn acres shifted to bean acres and we picked up on that.","And then also looking at next year in the corn business as you mentioned, we are going to be challenged on COGS in South America with the production issues that we faced in Argentina with the floods that we had late in the year, but I think as I step back and look at it, I feel good about the fundamentals of our corn business and the strength that we have in the fundamental corn business. And that is literally what gives us the confidence to speak to a five-year plan, where the vast majority of that growth is going to come from our core seeds and traits business.","Hugh Grant","So, Pierre maybe a few words on returns.","Pierre Courduroux","Yes. Maybe to address the specifics of your question, Vincent, regarding returns as we mentioned during the previous call last year, we got surprised in the fourth quarter with higher returns. I mean, we and the farmers actually got surprised with higher returns related to basically the fact that the market was spread in 97 million acres planning and it ended up being on more like 95 million acres. This year we have been very prudent, I think and we shouldn\u2019t be facing such an issue. And this was one of the reasons actually we were anticipating Q3 to be lower than last year in corn. So, I mean, there is no surprise to that. That\u2019s the message we tried to send during the Q2 earnings call and that\u2019s what we see today. So, we feel very comfortable that during our Q4, we shouldn\u2019t see any significant adjustments to our returns.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Because you just speak to the 5% to 10% price mix uplift in that sort of $1 billion target, are those still good?","Pierre Courduroux","So, as far as the 5% to 10% price mix uplift what we see this year is I mean from a margins perspective, we feel really good about the situation in the U.S. where we have seen both the cost of goods upgrades we were anticipating and also the price mix uplift. I mean, it was a more difficult year than we have seen in the past, but we have seen very nice price uplift. So, we still think this is a key driver of our growth going forward.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Okay, thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Yes, good morning. Yes, as you execute on the $10 billion recapitalization, can you speak to what implications if any the new program will have for alternative uses of capital I am thinking about trajectory on capital expenditures, SG&A expense, and what are your latest thoughts on M&A?","Hugh Grant","I will maybe ask Pierre to say few words. Our M&A \u2013 well, let me take a step back and kind of kick this up a piece, Kevin. We see as Brett made the point in the last question on our five-year growth targets, we see the lion\u2019s share of that growth coming of our core. So, any growth that we see from Climate Corp and some of the new platforms leads on top of that and then the capital allocation piece leverages that growth. So, that\u2019s how we are thinking about it. We will continue on CapEx. We will continue invest on building out our plans to drive capacity as we see share gains. I think as you look at the Climate Corp deal, we see that as a central integrator and that brings together our seeds, chemistry opportunities, fertilizer, machinery and our retail partners. It integrates them around that hub, but within that play, I would assume there is probably still going to be M&A opportunities and we are looking at keeping part \u2013 do that. So, I just I think with the five-year view, the key in this is our core business that drives the lion\u2019s share of that growth.","Pierre Courduroux","And maybe as a complement to what Hugh just said, I mean you are still looking at a business with strong cash generation, strong free cash generation. So when we made the decision that when our Board made the decision to vote on this buyback program we had assessed our potential for growth and the potential for cash generation. So we feel actually very good that we are going to be able to fund our business and the growth that we have in our plan going forward.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","As a follow-up if I may on the precision ag component of your plan, I think you described it as meaningful, you are over delivering in the near-term on the acreage, can you talk about what that acreage ramp could look like into fiscal \u201815 and beyond and also update us on kind of the economics of your partnership arrangement and how that flows through the Monsanto on a gross and net basis?","Hugh Grant","Yes. It\u2019s still early for how we are seeing that flow through. Kevin, I would say we are delighted in the performance this year. So when we laid out our goal and have the $20 million, if you draw that against any conventional ramp that we have seen 15 years in our seeds and traits business, it surpasses any of sort of growth from 20 million to 40 million acres in the first year and then see 30 million of that 40 acres as real users or users that using that on a regular basis. It gives us cause for optimism that we are delivering value and that we are growing the consumer experience, but Brett maybe a few words on how these partners are linking in?","Brett Begemann","Yes. I think Kevin as we look at this it\u2019s clearly continuing to build out the platform in early years and the contribution will be in the later years of the five year plan. I would say as Hugh mentioned I think this platform is demonstrating that it can be the integrator of bringing together decisions around how the farmer manages his land, his seed choices, his crop protection choices, his fertility programs, his equipment etcetera. And our goal will be to continue to build out that platform with our partners. And I am thrilled at this point to have basically all of our large retail partners on board with us. We are in conversations with lots of other potential partners to bring that together. So I continue to look at this as very excited given the success we have had in early years. And the real expression of interest from the farmer level with these early acres that\u2019s huge. Farmers are telling us that they are really interested. The key is their behavior followed what they have been telling us that they were interested in. But the build out from a financial standpoint will be later in that five year plan Kevin.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Roberts from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS","Thank you. Could you give us the Roundup or the Glyphosate price volume trends in the quarter and do you become capacity constraint in Glyphosate anytime in this five year plan that you have got?","Hugh Grant","Yes. John thanks for your question. I think I used to say we are half of the business and the Chinese of the other half. We have the smaller half of that now. So we \u2013 I like the strategy, we make what we sell, so we make a bunch of Roundup and we sell everything that we make every year and that\u2019s pretty good model for a business. And we price \u2013 we lay our price in pretty much right in top of generic Glyphosate. So there is nothing fancy in this but it works, it\u2019s simple and it\u2019s served us well this year. Trends in the quarter \u2013 Brett maybe will work on this year versus next year that maybe helpful.","Brett Begemann","Yes. I don\u2019t think that we saw the trends change all that much this year. We started this year say and we will be flat to up through the year. And as I look to the future, I expect Roundup to be flat to down going forward versus the uptrend and we see that playing out in the marketplace going through next year. So I don\u2019t see significant movement on that going forward next year, but the trend would be flat to down. But again it\u2019s in a supporting role of our core seeds and traits business. And as you have said we sell a lot of Roundup every year. And we are going to focus on our core seeds and traits.","John Roberts - UBS","We wouldn\u2019t expect any significant capital then to go to that business, I would suspect over this five-year plan?","Brett Begemann","No. We would no and that\u2019s a great segue John. Today we announced five-year goal of doubling EPS. We see significant growth in the business. Roundup is a great product, it\u2019s a great cash generator, but for more than 2019 looking back it\u2019s going to be our seeds and traits business that really drives that growth is the integration of the Climate Corp platform and how we integrate those two pieces together and that\u2019s really going to be the central, that\u2019s the central core of our growth story at Monsanto going forward.","John Roberts - UBS","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. I know you can\u2019t say too much, but should we take that interest perhaps as signs of one either increased interest in crop chemicals or two increased confidence by you of the introduction of GMCs into Europe given recent rulings by the EU?","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the question. I think, I don\u2019t think there is an awful lot of value and speculation. I have always been a really \u2013 I have always been a big believer on action speaking lot of those on words. And I think this morning there is probably 10 billion good reasons why we should be focusing on our growth opportunities. Here is how I would frame it. Since November, since the back end of last year when we announced the Climate Corp deal, we have been focused and we have talked a lot about the 40 decisions that a grower needs to make when he is producing a crop. And I see clearly in the next five years that, that Climate Corp deal becomes the center of an integrating platform.","And if you say so how does M&A play in that? I think that there is obviously we talked about this Pierre mentioned earlier, there was obviously M&A opportunities there, but my guess is more of this is going to be done through partnerships, partnerships at the seed level, the chemistry, because chemistry then becomes an integrated part in those 40 decisions, fertilizer, machinery and our key retail partners and how they all come together and that orchestra to play a vital part. So, when you think about it that way, I don\u2019t think this is as much about M&A as much as building that network of partnerships. And I would say this morning and we have been working on this for a long time, but the decision this morning on this new path, I think is an inflection point for the company. And as you look at future growth that the $10 billion reinvestment in our own growth story, I think is more compelling than the M&A argument.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Very clear. And you just saw in the GM issue in Europe given the EU, given I guess approval to the authority to those individual countries to make decisions. As your confident increases where we might see GMCs in Europe in the next three to five years?","Hugh Grant","In our five-year growth plan, so as we commit to doubling our EPS, but we are not holding our breath on that. I think it\u2019s encouraging that member states are going to start choosing their own destiny, but it just moves achingly slowly. So, I think as we think about the growth opportunities ahead in seeds and traits, we see very real opportunities in the Eastern Europe. We see great opportunities emerging in the Ukraine, but our core growth areas are going to get bigger in the next five years. And I don\u2019t think Europe is going to play a major part in the next three to five years.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Don Carson from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna","Yes, thank you. Hugh, a question on your growth target, is growth from the traditional GMO pipeline diminishing as a kind of contributor to earnings growth? Post Intacta, I think you got a few things in the pipeline like the dicamba tolerance, corn rootworm 3, and the yield and stress, but is that way you are focusing more on the new transformational platforms like precision ag and biologicals?","Hugh Grant","No, I think \u2013 so, we have always been very careful, Don, on what really is in adjacency. And I think the Climate Corp deal and the biologicals is a natural extension from driving value in the bank and driving value simultaneously outside the bank. The kind of crunch for us is real simple how do you deliver more yields to the grower on the same acres over time? And if you look, we talked about this in our Investor Day, if you look forward than the next 20 years, there are no new acres. With one or two exceptions, there are no new acres and then sustainable intensification yield becomes more and more important. And the way you unlock that on a sustainable basis is providing better advice to the grower that allows him or her to get more bushels on that same footprint. So you have run through exactly our pipeline opportunities. They come in the next half decade to decade. They are all significant opportunities and during that time I think we have the opportunity to integrate as I mentioned earlier a bunch of other inputs and use them more efficiently and unlock that yield. So I really, really don\u2019t see this as an either or. I see this as in both pieces playing together and that\u2019s I think that\u2019s the beauty in the strategy and that\u2019s what triggered the reinvestment decision and put $10 billion behind that call.","Don Carson - Susquehanna","Just two clarifications, does biologicals contribute at all to your 2019 earnings growth target. And you say precision ag will be a meaningful contributor, can you define meaningful, it will be more quantitative on how you define that?","Hugh Grant","So Don, it\u2019s a little early for us to give precise numbers regarding the 2019. The number we laid out was $4 billion from the core business, from the base business which is really seeds and traits only. Actually biologicals and Climate and the new platforms are separate from these $4 billion. So, microbials by the \u2013 biologicals by the end of this five-year period is not going to be very significant. Climate, however, we will have to do some work there to let you guys think about it and we will come back to you with some stuff with maybe a little more detail on how we think about Climate in our projections.","Don Carson - Susquehanna","Thank you.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the monetization of Intacta, specifically what you are seeing from seeing from your Brazilian customer base as we head into next year. And then also out of your 10 million to 12 million acre estimate, what expectation if any do you have for Argentina and Latin America and South acreage? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","So two there \u2013 how is the money flowing and acreage outside Brazil, Brett.","Brett Begemann","I think I will look at this year with the tremendous performance we had in Intacta meeting or exceeding our yield expectations and insect control replacement peaks volumes to the performance of the product which then looking at 10 million to 12 million acres next year which is a huge step up from where we were at 3 million acres this year. So the monetization is going really well. Farmers are seeing the value and they are stepping up to the plate. As to the breakout between Brazil and Argentina the 10 million to 12 million acres is inclusive of all of it. The vast majority of it will come from Brazil next year. We are just getting started in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","Hi, good morning guys and let me add my congratulations on the share repurchase. As you move towards getting to $11 plus a share in 2019, how much of that is going to come from share repurchases and how much let\u2019s say from net income growth?","Hugh Grant","Mark thanks for the question. We see the lion share is coming from our core business. Pierre maybe a few words on Climate Corp and how the other pieces layer in.","Pierre Courduroux","I mean really the \u2013 as Hugh was mentioning that the lion share of the growth is going to be coming from the business and plus the impact of the original huge buyback we are going to be doing. We are banking on the growth of our business to layout this target of doubling our EPS. And that\u2019s really on the confidence actually we have that we are going to be able to grow our base business and to grow our earnings during that period. That\u2019s one of the key drivers for our decision now to buyback our stock because we think that\u2019s one of the best investments we could make in our own stock basically.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","And as a follow-up just a couple of credit type questions, what kind of debt rating do you anticipate having as you move through the share repurchase and what kind of interest rate should we use in our modeling for this?","Pierre Courduroux","So obviously the rating agencies will have to do their work and come back to us and come back to the market with the rating of our debt. It was a priority for us to still be a stronger credit rating and we are confident we will be in a good place but we should hear from the rating agencies shortly. So I cannot anticipate on their final ratings.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","And interest rate?","Pierre Courduroux","It will depend obviously on the credit rating and will depend also on the appetite for the market for our bond.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","Thank you.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Jester - Citigroup","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Dan Jester on for PJ. So, as you have this five-year plan, is the Climate Corp, FieldScripts, are those still U.S. focused businesses over that whole five-year period or should we be expecting some geographic expansion due to Canada or Latin America or other regions making a contribution over this five-year period? Thank you.","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the question. The first build out will be in the U.S. So, the encouraging news today was 20 million going to 40 million acres. So, it\u2019s a great Groundbreaker\u2019s start, but I would guess by the five-year period, we will start to see that build out occurring in our Brazilian and Argentinean markets as well. There is tremendous interest there already.","Dan Jester - Citigroup","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Tiberio from Miller Tabak & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak & Company","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a clarifying question around your comments around capital allocations ag productivity. I wasn\u2019t certain if whether that was for the overall ag productivity segment or just for Roundup? And as kind of a tie-in there, I noticed that one of your partners has announced the dicamba production expansion in the U.S. And I was just wondering if we are at a point where you can start talking about whether you anticipate that dicamba would be produced internally or whether there is a higher probability that maybe we should be looking more towards the JV type structure?","Hugh Grant","That\u2019s a great distinction. I think the earlier question really related specifically to Roundup. As you look at dicamba, it\u2019s hard to call at the moment, but if I was looking ahead settling the next five years, I would anticipate there is a likelihood that we would be investing in the capital and production. I would anticipate also that our partner BSF may as well and I would expect that beyond us we will see increased capacity going in China and in India as well. So, there is tremendous anticipation and noise in the market. The groundbreaking work, the early trials have really led up to the performance of the product. And I think as an opportunity to upgrade our Roundup Ready choose one more time, but I would expect we will see capital flow, and this opportunity from a range of resources.","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak & Company","Great, thanks for your time and congratulations again on the buyback.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carly Mattson from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thank you. In the context of your capital structure, could you talk to whether there is strategic or commercial reasons to maintain the single A rating or if we should view the new leverage guidance as an indication that Monsanto could be comfortable operating as a BBB credit?","Hugh Grant","I mean, that\u2019s pretty much the question I answered. I mean, we cannot share with \u2013 I mean, we don\u2019t have obviously the final credit ratings from the credit rating agencies and they will decide we feel comfortable based on the work we have been doing that will end up in a good place, but obviously it\u2019s totally pending on the credit rating agencies. And as I said, they will have to do their work. And we are expecting them to come back to us fairly shortly.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs","So, there is no strategic or commercial reason though from a business perspective to have a single A rating?","Hugh Grant","As I said, I mean, we feel based on our personal work, the work of our teams that we are in a really good position to run our business going forward.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Bryan Hurley","Kevin, I think we can go to the next question.","Operator","Sure. Next question is coming from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for slipping me in there, Bryan. Two quick questions. One on the Round Ready 2 Xtend, I think you have targeted 65 million acres, could you give us a sense of what that average acre might spend today on secondary herbicide treatment, so we can think about the opportunity set? And then secondly, Pierre, we know you love to be conservative, but I guess if I look at your forecast, you guess seeds and traits gross profit is growing about 60% in the next five years compared to maybe 50% in the prior five years. If you did the math, you could get to a doubling of EPS just from that alone. So obviously you are buying some stock in that timeframe and I think you have talked about having some accretive benefit from some of the new programs, is there some offsets that we should think about that limit that growth to only 15% a year?","Hugh Grant","So on this six \u2013 let me start Bob. So thanks for your questions. On the $65 million, it\u2019s probably bigger than that I think. We are chasing $100 million on Intacta opportunity. You layer 2s on top of that but I think $65 million would be what would be \u2013 using Bob\u2019s words on conservative $65 million would be a conservative estimate, right.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","The North American number.","Hugh Grant","Yes. So that would be the U.S. And then any insight on to Bob\u2019s question on spend on acre spend or\u2026?","Brett Begemann","I think the way to look at it Bob is that will be something that we will do extensive work on as we get ready to commercialize the product, but a significant number of farmers have moved to multiple molecules on the field which we have encouraged over the years to minimize the development of resistant weeds and but the Roundup Ready Xtend program becomes a component within that, but there are farmers using multiple herbicides now to get those multiple modes of action. So there is clearly an opportunity to reduce the number of products that they are using and what they are spending today by substituting in Roundup Ready Xtend. But that\u2019s the analysis we are doing now as we look at the product in the field and we will be more definitive on that as we go forward.","Pierre Courduroux","And maybe answering the second part of your question Bob, we feel as I mentioned I mean we feel the lion share of our growth is going to be coming from our core business that\u2019s really the key driver behind the numbers we are laying out and our targets to more than double to at least double our EPS going forward. I mean we are projecting five years down the road and I mean we have got really good visibility on a couple of things I mean mainly on seeds and traits business and that\u2019s where the core of the growth is going to be coming with those $4 billion of additional GP we are talking about. But laying out a five years target I mean I wouldn\u2019t say we want to be conservative, but we want to be very realistic about the number we are laying out in front of our investors so that\u2019s one of the reasons we laid out this target and we actually feel really good about our approach there.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Bryan Hurley","Thank you very much. Kevin I recognize that we are at the bottom of the hour, given the breadth of the information we have covered here today let\u2019s maybe extend it just a little bit and get a couple of more questions in.","Operator","Certainly, our next question is coming from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in as well. I had a couple of questions on your target leverage. So maybe you can talk about how came up with the 1.5 times target leverage range. And then it would seem like if you didn\u2019t do any M&A, I guess what I am trying to get out is if you didn\u2019t do any M&A are you holding by that 1.5 times leverage where in two years you would do more buybacks than $10 billion to get there? Thanks.","Hugh Grant","I was just going to say this is in the \u2013 as I mentioned in my remarks at the end of 18 months there is lot of careful work that gives us the ability to continue to invest as we said earlier in CapEx and M&A, but Pierre maybe your view on how you came with 1.5.","Pierre Courduroux","So we came to this 1.5 I mean thinking about how we were going to be able to operate our business. We wanted to keep room for M&A as Hugh was mentioning and investing in our business, so this was really the result of the work we have been doing over the last 18 months that\u2019s how we ended up in this place. And one other things I would like to mention is coming from I mean almost minus 0.5 leverage ratio, negative minus 0.5 leverage ratio and going to the 1.5 leverage ratio I mean freeing up 2X our net debt to EBITDA and that\u2019s worth about $10 billion, so that\u2019s really how we came to that and where we feel good about the move we have just made.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","And would you hold by that 1.5 times leverage is that a rigid target that you will hit regardless of the M&A opportunities come two years from now?","Pierre Courduroux","We have mentioned in the script that we would recalibrate over time but we feel really good about this number and that\u2019s really the target we have for the foreseeable future.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you.","Bryan Hurley","Kevin, why don\u2019t we try to squeeze in two more questions here?","Operator","Certainly. Your next question is coming from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","Yes, thank you for the question. I just wanted to breakdown into little bit more detail to this $4 billion in growth from seeds and traits, if you could sort of breakout between soybeans and corn and maybe from your other crops, where you see the biggest growth drivers? I know you have talked about the decade of the soybean, but if you could sort of give us some ballpark guidance, that will be helpful?","Hugh Grant","So, our goal was not to breakdown the $4 billion by crops, because as we said there are number of things that are going to happen into the trajectory maybe slightly different from the crop \u2013 on a crop-by-crop basis, but what is really clear to us is that corn will have to play a major role as part of the growth. And if you remember what we laid out during our Investor Day earlier in the year, price only should be able to yield about $1 billion. So, if you add volume benefits to that over time, you can get an order of magnitude regarding corn and similarly for soybeans which is going to be the ever key player in this $4 billion. I mean, we laid that at Investor Day as well of more than $1 billion of GP coming from soybeans. So, it kind of gives you the order of magnitudes. But as we mentioned, I mean, we are anticipating that our crops are going to be playing nice parts also in the $4 billion.","Brett Begemann","The gorgeous thing is we got such a nice hedge between corn and soybeans. When you look this year to the growth in beans, it\u2019s still going to be a cotton story, but the beans performance is really a huge contributor as well.","Bryan Hurley","Why don\u2019t we move on and make our last question here before we wrap up with the couple of final comments by Hugh.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Thank you very much. Is the 10 billion in announced share repurchase over and above the 1 billion that\u2019s remaining from your old share repurchase and can you make a quick comment on the rise in receivables and inventories year-over-year which are up about 20% even though your sales are up about 4%?","Pierre Courduroux","So, regarding your first question, the answer is yes. So the 10 billion that is additional to the 1 billion, so that\u2019s an easy answer. Regarding our working capital we announced really early in the year that we were rebuilding our seeds inventories following two years of challenging production, so the spike you see in inventories was really expected. Regarding the receivables, it\u2019s a combination of factors, one of which being the weights that we have seen in the early days from our high productivity business, which is usually collected during the fourth quarter. So, this is something we are going to be collecting in the fourth quarter we feel really good about. And the second element is just management decision we made not to use some of our credit facilities, customer financing in the third quarter will use the facility in the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s really the high level story for our receivables increase.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you very much.","Hugh Grant - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So, let me thank everybody for your patience and for joining us on the call this morning. As you can tell, it\u2019s obviously a very important day for us as we have laid out a strategy that guides our growth through the next season, but also for the next five years. So, let me just conclude this morning by emphasizing a few points. We haven\u2019t laid a multi-year target for several years. And our ability to do so today is a real statement on the confidence that we have in our core growth and as our core growth and the expansion of our strategy as new platforms like the Climate Corporation start defining even more opportunities going forward. And we are backing that confidence today with $10 billion in share buybacks resulting in a capital structure that I think the major step forward in our capital allocation and it will further strengthen our growth going forward. So, we are focused on delivering that opportunity and we look forward to continuing to share our progress with you. And we hope \u2013 we sincerely hope that many of you will be able to join us in August in the field for our Whistle Stop Event, where we will have a firsthand look at this growth story going forward. So, thanks very much for your attention and your support this morning.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"14666":["Monsanto (NYSE:MON) Q4 2012 Earnings Call October  3, 2012  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Bryan Hurley - Director of Investor Relations","Hugh Grant - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee","Brett D.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr. Hurley. You may now begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the line. Thanks for joining our year-end earnings conference call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; and also Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also joining me are Manny Cruz, Bryan Corkal and Ashley Wissmann, my colleagues in Investor Relations. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address.","We're providing you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and press release, both of which are posted to our website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is also included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.","With this call, we address the guidance and growth drivers for our 2013 fiscal year. With the fourth quarter results in hand, we generated 25% ongoing earnings per share growth for the full year. Likewise, our results for the year in the quarter track near the expectations we laid out in our third quarter update, so we've seen the growth from the areas of the business we expected in fiscal '12.","Given the focus on 2013, Hugh will start today with an overview of our strategy and how we're thinking about growth this year and for the long term. From there, we'll have Brett Begemann walk through the operational drivers that give us confidence in our growth expectations. And then Pierre will lay out the translation of that growth into our guidance and financial outlook.","So with that, let me hand it to Hugh.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line. We've been talking and planning for fiscal year 2013 for a while now. By any measure, fiscal 2012 was a compelling year. Today, however, we turn our focus to 2013 and what our continuing growth looks like. We'll also emphasize how that growth happens. I'll let Brett walk you through the details and the milestones of our operational plans for 2013, and my focus will be on how those growth drivers come together over time.","There's 3 areas that I'd like to emphasize. First, the foundation for this growth is the success that we've had over the past 2 years, and I'm particularly proud of what Monsanto achieved in 2012. We delivered 25% ongoing EPS growth and a record $2 billion in free cash flow. And that speaks to everything that matters to our business. It reinforces the strong fundamental environment in agriculture. Equally important, it's the proof point in our business. We have the right growth strategy in place, we're executing well, we're focused on discipline and we're capturing the momentum in our business.","That sets up my second point. Because that strategy is in full swing, 2013 becomes a logical extension of 2012, driving growth as a continuation of what we accomplished this year, and that reinforces our confidence in 2013. We've had back-to-back years of strong performance. That compounding effect means we'll build off a significantly higher base. That's shown on Slide 5, where our ongoing earnings per share guidance range of $4.18 to $4.32 reflects mid-teens ongoing earnings growth from our 2012 endpoint.","And 2013 is setting up nicely. We're carrying good momentum in the U.S., we're on the front edge of some significant acceleration in Latin America, and the latest harvest data that we will share with you today reinforces our confidence in our products. A month and a half ago, as many of you were standing with me in a field in Illinois for our Whistle Stop event, I said at that time we thought that even as overall yields would be down, the relative showing of our products would be good. Now we have the data, and that's exactly what we see. Our yield advantage is shining through even in one of the most difficult seasons on record for our growers.","And finally, as good as I feel about this year, I feel equally good about our opportunity over a horizon of the next 5-plus years. As our growth is more global, we're adding a couple of new layers coming online each year. The intersection of our current business and our R&D pipeline gets even more exciting over the long term as we roll out significant new platforms that reinforce our opportunity as a yield company. In this past year, we tested Intacta and DroughtGard and our new Ground Breakers program. We added our Integrated Farming Systems and our BioDirect platforms, and that's a compelling opportunity that's balanced in the near term and offers significant upside in the longer term, giving us a strong view on how our growth shapes up well beyond 2013.","I also recognize that the opportunity for Monsanto in 2013 plays out on a much larger stage. With this year's terrible drought that underscores how stretched the world's grain resources are, and that reinforces that the drivers of Agricultural Productivity are real and are ongoing. The world needs sustainable productivity growth, and that creates a tremendous runway for agriculture.","We've emphasized the point that we're a yield company. And whether it's the business performance that drove our growth to this point or specific opportunity in 2013 or the long-term promise of our pipeline, what drives us is our ability to deliver yield in more ways than anyone else in this industry. That opportunity clearly begins in 2013, and on a call like this, the details really matter. So I'm very pleased to have Brett with us here today. In his role as President and Chief Commercial Officer, Brett's leading our near-term growth initiatives, so he's in the best position to walk you through these growth drivers in more detail. So Brett?","Brett D. Begemann","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to have the chance to join you this morning. As Hugh said, my focus is putting the operational plans behind our growth, so I'll highlight where I'm focused and how I'll measure success. I'll also echo Hugh's overall sentiment. Given the strong performance in our business and the momentum we carry into 2013, we're in a very strong operational position to deliver growth.","Let me start with Slide 6. We expect the drivers of our growth in 2013 to be reassuringly familiar, and we expect the growth will be divided fairly evenly between our core U.S. business and our accelerating international opportunity.","The first part of that 2013 growth revolves around the U.S., which continues to be the anchor for our business. That starts on Slide 7, as we'll continue to drive trade upgrades and mix improvement as we build out our platforms in corn and soybeans.","In 2011, we tipped from emerging opportunities to establish platforms for both Roundup Ready 2 Yield in soybeans and the Refuge-Reduction Family in corn. We expect to step up Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans again in 2013, reaching the range of 39 to 41 million acres, as we drive penetration in our brands and reach a critical mass among licensees. Likewise, we expect approximately 36 to 38 million acres for the Reduced Refuge Family in 2013, as we expand the offering of Refuge-In-The-Bag across all 3 of our products in that family.","As we drive the annual upgrade of our seed portfolio to the latest high-value germplasm, we're also well positioned to continue the gains we saw this year. With returns now finalized, we can definitely say our U.S. branded seed volume grew by the largest increment in the last 3 years. With share gains of more than 1 point in both branded corn and soybeans, our volume growth exceeded this year's market size expansion. That sets up for continued volume growth in 2013. That also plays out in price, where the mix benefit of our portfolio upgrade drives our opportunity. With our pricing cards out and plans in place, we see a total portfolio price lift in corn in the range of 5% to 10% from this upgrade, and the biggest driver is the mix effect, as this is less about price pass-through on apples-to-apples products and more about the opportunity created when we leverage our R&D engine to bring new, high-yielding products online.","With the seed production capabilities and infrastructure we have, we're also confident in supplying seed for the coming year. It's obvious that our business planning is happening against the backdrop of this year's devastating drought.","On a positive side, as farmers turn toward next year, seed is a priority. As I think about seed availability, 2013 is set up to be remarkably similar to 2012. Last year, storms and heat stretched our seed production. This year, it was drought. We've built our overall U.S. plan based on the reality that 2013 corn acres are likely to be in the same 96-million-acre range and soybean acres could potentially be higher than this year's 76 million acres. You'll see some natural cost pressure in a production year like this, but that balances against our hedging strategies, some cost pass-through and the continuation of higher acre ranges.","The final piece of this U.S. look is perhaps the most important, and that's performance, on Slides 8 through 11. With the dry conditions, corn harvest moved more rapidly, so there's more corn data available earlier this year. Soybean data is still coming in, but the anecdotal feedback has been good again this year. I won't do a deep dive, but let me give you a snapshot of the early results.","First, on Slide 9. In a year when overall U.S. corn yields are down significantly, DEKALB's relative yield advantage is as strong as ever. In fact, the lower yields magnify our performance, and this year is trending to be our second highest percent advantage in the last decade. It's a relevant data point because when DEKALB shows up this well in a tough year, I believe it cements our reputation for performance. Farmers see DEKALB shine in high-yield years and outperform even in the lowest yielding years. So they're seeing a degree of consistency and bottom line performance that influences purchases for many years.","If you go to Slide 10, this is a new layer of data this year. As the industry matures and each seed company uses different trait combinations, I believe farmers will focus even more on the bottom line yield performance regardless of the trait package. And you'll see in areas like the South and the Central Corn Belt where data is in, our DEKALB products consistently outyield the commercial products sold by our competitors, reinforcing our position as offering the premium, highest yielding total package.","If I move to Slide 11, one of the highlights of the regional look is our DroughtGard Ground Breakers results, particularly in a year like this. We compare our DroughtGard Hybrids specifically against the competitor's drought-marketed products. In this head-to-head data, the DroughtGard Hybrids we'll commercialize from Ground Breakers showed a yield advantage of approximately 5 bushels an acre. That reinforces the value of having a combined system of traits and germplasm and puts us into the commercial track for 2013 as DroughtGard becomes our next offering for the Western Corn Belt.","And before I leave the yield data, I'd make one final point. At this time of year, we get a lot of data from the U.S. because of harvest, but the trends and yield advantages we see in the U.S. are transferable to our international regions. Very simply, the differentiated performance in the U.S. comes from the strength of our germplasm and our ability to apply capabilities like markers and chippers. Logically, we're doing those same things in markets from Latin America to Europe. That strong performance translates directly to leading positions in the key countries and continued opportunity to grow our volume globally.","And that's the perfect segue to the second half of our growth, the international opportunity. This is an opportunity that's been in the shadow of the U.S. business for some time. But in the last couple of years, we've really seen some critical drivers emerge that shine the spotlight on our growing global growth. That begins in Latin America, an area where we see acceleration in 2013. In particular, we expect the continued ramp-up of the corn opportunity in Brazil and Argentina will become one of the single largest sources of growth in the next few years.","It begins in Brazil on Slide 12. The rapid trait growth to date has been driven on just initial trait penetration. But as we look to 2013, we'll get a double shot of opportunity, as we expect to both expand absolute penetration and continue the upgrade cycle. One of the keys for the growth is the upgrade to the first true double-stack called VT PRO 2. We expect that to step up from a small amount of our mix in 2012 to the second highest-volume trait in our portfolio in 2013. That's important because the trait gross profit lift as we upgrade to double-stack is between 70% and 80% per acre over our first generation product.","In Argentina, we have one of our largest seed footprints. And on Slide 13, you can see the key for the 2013 is upgrading that base from the double-stack to the triple-stack. We expect VT Triple PRO will be more than 1\/3 of our branded mix in 2013. Like Brazil, the upgrade is important as there's a 20% to 30% trait gross profit lift over the existing double-stack. Both Brazil and Argentina also follow a similar pattern to the U.S., where the portfolio turnover drives a germplasm upgrade as well. And with the rapid upgrades going on, the collective Latin American mix upgrade is actually moving faster today than in the U.S.","The summer corn seasons are still shaping up in Latin America. Practically, with the commodity ratios favoring soybeans today, we expect corn acres in the summer season to come down some from last year's peaks. That's balanced by the second Safrinha season, where acres are expected to ramp up. Despite some of those acre shifts, early indicators for our business are showing up extremely well. In particular, the orders we have track squarely with our expectations for both total trait penetration and the expected trait upgrades for 2013. That means we're tracking well against our overall plans, and with the deliveries rolling out now, we'll see that positive trend in the first quarter results Pierre will cover.","Corn drives the 2013 opportunity in Latin America, but soybeans will come online over the next few years as a new layer. So it's an opportunity we're building plans for today. That soybean growth really revolves around Intacta, and it reflects how far we've come in building a system since the early days when Roundup Ready soybeans were grown illegally in Brazil. As many of you have followed, there have been legal challenges over the past 8 years in getting a royalty collection system in place for Roundup Ready 1. Our position has been upheld by multiple Brazilian courts, but the challenges continue. Just to emphasize, these suits are centered on Roundup Ready 1, not Intacta. We recognize that the various cases will continue through the legal system, and that takes time. But practically everything is operating as usual with Roundup Ready 1, and we continue to feel confident in that legal process.","If I shift to the growth opportunity, we're on the front edge of the opportunity for Intacta, shown on Slide 14. While this year is financially immaterial for earnings, it's a major strategic jumping off point for Intacta. We see Intacta as a step change for farmers, and farmers' own data for our Ground Breakers program showed yield benefits of greater than 4 bushels an acre and helped create more than $80 in new value on every acre. We're using 2013 to position ourselves for a rapid ramp-up when we expect to hit the broad commercialization in fiscal 2014. Most importantly, with in-country approvals, we can build on the initial Ground Breakers testing from fiscal year 2012 while we finalize everything ahead of commercial rollout.","This year, we have expanded availability of varieties and overall acres with more commercial growers. We reach more customers and a larger geographic region, which builds the base of customer experience. At the same time, we're building the seed and varieties we need to be in a position for next year. Taken together, that extra customer experience and focused commercial preparation puts us in a good place to make sure we showcase Intacta's breakthrough benefits when it hits the commercial stage.","The last highlight I'd offer revolves around another key piece of our global business, and that's our germplasm growth on Slide 15. In 2013, growth in the corn business isn't limited to top-of-mind geographies like North and South America. We also expect the corn business to grow in conventional seed markets, ranging from Mexico to Western Europe.","The best near-term example of that 2013 opportunity is Eastern Europe, on Slide 16. The corn footprint in Eastern Europe is as big as Brazil, and it's expanding. In the past few years, we've effectively doubled our share, outpacing a growing market. Just like the U.S., there was a significant drought in Eastern Europe. And the rebound expected next year, as corn acres continue to remain strong, provides a strong backdrop for one of our fastest-growing businesses.","I've focused on the drivers at the heart of our core business for 2013. From an operational standpoint, we're focused, we have a consistent strategy and we're entering the year with momentum. The last 2 years have been important in confirming our strategy and reigniting growth, and that's one of the strongest sources of confidence for me because we have the tools we need to drive growth. We just have to focus on execution. And that means our growth is backed by strong operational plans. We've turned an important corner as a business, and we're focused on turning the momentum we've started into real growth and a growing global business.","With that, let me hand the time over to Pierre, who will give you the specifics of how this translates to our guidance outlook for 2013.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everybody on the line. Today, I'll focus on translating the fiscal year '12 endpoints and the priorities Brett described into the core elements of our earnings and cash guidance for 2013. But before I do so, let me start on Slide 17 and summarize my views on where we stand from a financial point of view.","First, as Hugh and Brett said, we are seeing our growth continue, and we expect mid-teens ongoing EPS growth in fiscal 2013. This is growth off a higher compounded base, and it speaks to the strong engine we have in place. But in my role, I'd also like to know that we've built our plans in ways that accommodate the normal variability in agriculture. And when I step back, I feel good that our guidance is based on growth that's balanced and achievable.","Second, we continue to be able to translate our earnings growth into free cash. The efficient translation of earnings to cash is always a focal point for us. So the reality that we have generated approximately $2 billion in earnings and $2 billion in cash in 2012 is a compelling proof point for me.","And third, as we translate the operation plans Brett described, we're certainly becoming more global, more diversified, and that is creating better balance and flexibility for us. Our business profile is now more global, and this gives us the opportunity to manage variability and meet our underlying earnings commitments.","I think the best way to see the translation of the 2013 operation plan Brett laid out into guidance is to walk you through the key lines of the financial statements on Slide 18. If we start with the bottom line earnings, our ongoing EPS guidance range tracks the mid-teens growth off the FY '12 endpoint of $3.70 per share, which translate to $4.18 to $4.32 per share for fiscal year '13.","Above the line, we expect our Seeds and Genomics gross profit will continue to grow. In 2012, our Seeds and Genomics gross profit crossed the $6-billion mark for the first time, coming in at nearly $6.1 billion. For 2013, we'll build on that new level, as we expect to reach segment gross profit in the range of $6.55 billion. The strongest driver of our segment growth in 2012 was our corn gross profit, and that will be true this year as well. With the continued build-out of the U.S. and the acceleration in Latin America, we expect double-digit gross profit growth from our corn business. That is complemented by contributions in growth from soybeans, vegetable and our other seeds and traits crops. After a challenging year in 2012 for vegetables, we expect the beginning of the return to growth. We have a modest positive GP growth contribution beginning in 2013.","So we expect this growth to be offset somewhat by cotton. As commodities favor corn and soybean acres in 2013, we expect significantly lower planted cotton acres in the U.S., and that will reflect on our cotton business performance.","The other above-the-line contributor is expected to be Ag Productivity. For fiscal year '12, Ag Productivity generated $986 million in gross profit, with year-over-year growth that reflects strong performance across the board. We achieved strong volume and mix in Roundup, we've had another good year in our lawn-and-garden business, and we're seeing some growth in our selective chemistry offering.","Our 2012 results confirm how we think about Ag Productivity. We've reset the strategy, and now it's really approaching a steady state. We've seen a positive lift in the gross profit as we've been able to implement the strategy we laid out 2 years ago, and we have delivered on execution. For 2013, we don't see significant shifts in the strategy or financial profile for this -- from this year, and we expect total gross profit for this segment in the range of $1 billion.","Moving below the line, let me now highlight another key area on the financial walk-through. For our expenses, we are focused on maintaining our discipline, so our spending grows at a lower rate than our top line, and that creates leverage for bottom line earnings. As we look at the operating expense lines of SG&A and R&D combined, for 2013, we expect those to grow at a rate lower than our sales growth.","We ended 2012 with SG&A at about $2.4 billion, which was consistent with our revised guidance during the year. The year-over-year uptick reflects the acceleration of our business during the year, as we used some additional SG&A in the form of commissions and some investments in our people, structure and organization. Going into 2013, we expect SG&A to be in the range of $2.55 billion.","On the R&D line, we ended fiscal year 2012 with an R&D spend of $1.5 billion, which also reflected our expectations of higher spend with our revised guidance during the year. We were able to make some incremental investments in R&D in 2012 to speed the development of key projects like our Latin American launches and new platforms like our Integrated Farming Systems and BioDirect work. Since we made those investments in 2012, we expect only modest incremental growth in 2013, with total R&D spend in the range of $1.53 billion.","The final factor in our earnings guidance is the tax rate. With the year-end rate right at 30% for fiscal year 2012, we expect our annual tax rate will maintain a similar range in 2013 at 30% to 31%.","If I bring all those P&L elements together, let me tell you how I see the trends that drive earnings for 2013 on Slide 19. First, I expect that our Seeds and Genomics gross profit growth will be split almost evenly between the U.S. and our international regions. We may see the balance of that growth tip toward one side or the other based on the actual business performance throughout the year, but as I look at the big picture of growth, there is good overall balance as the strong growth rates in international regions like Latin America provide a nice complement to the expansion of our larger core business in the U.S.","Second, as I look at the components of the 2013 growth, they are the same sources we saw driving our 2012 performance. The largest contributors are mix and volume. On the mix side, the technology adoption and portfolio upgrades Brett described drive this opportunity. And we will complement that with additional volume growth as the expansion of our base business in key geographies continues to drive nice overall volume growth for the company.","That sets up my expectations for the flow of earnings throughout the year on Slide 20. The first proof point of the operational drivers comes in the first quarter. Last year, we saw a significant increase in earnings coming through Q1 as Latin America became a larger contributor. This year, we see similar significant growth as we project Q1 to be another pronounced increase versus last year, and that reflects 2 big factors.","The most prominent is the acceleration of the corn opportunity in Latin America, as the trait upgrade cycle continues the trends we saw beginning last year. Adding to that in 2013, is some positive timing and shifts in the flow of the U.S. business, which means we expect to see more of the U.S. growth showing up in Q1 this year. With a trend to early order, we expect the possibility of some earlier shipment this year, and we are also seeing some overall structural shifts as more seed is moving in the first quarter as our volume grows and we manage the logistics around getting seed placed in the distribution system.","The majority of our earning still comes in the second and third quarter, as they reflect the large markets in the northern hemisphere including the U.S. But with a shift in the U.S. seed positioning benefitting Q1, the growth in those quarters will proportionally be lower, although we still expect an increase for the combined Q2 and Q3 period over last year.","The last piece I'll cover is the outlook for free cash flow on Slide 21. We generated a record amount of free cash flow in 2012, generating more than $2 billion in total free cash. That is important not just because it's a record, but it's actually one of the strongest indicators to me that our execution is translating the business opportunity into bottom line financials.","If you look at that $2 billion, what you see is that a good portion of our net income growth directly flowed through to free cash, and that's a reflection of 2 key factors: number one, our collections remain strong as the record free cash flow also reflects a record level number of collections for the full year; number two, in 2012, we maintained balance sheet discipline with a strong focus on working capital elements and were able to see the benefit of the restructuring work we undertook over the past few years that helped offset the natural working capital increase you'd expect as a part of a growing business. Most importantly, we expect our business performance and discipline will continue to be reflected in our cash generation capability in 2013 and project free cash flow in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.","With that outlook, we expect to continue the translation of earnings into cash while accommodating for the funding of growth within our free cash. I'd highlight a couple of key considerations:","First, the driver for cash generation will continue to be our net income.","Second, with the growth opportunities in our business, we have the confidence to make some incremental CapEx investment. As we grow our footprint in regions like Latin America and Eastern Europe, we will put some capital in place that will support our next rounds of growth. So while our CapEx has been tracking close to depreciation and amortization for the past couple of years, those incremental investments this year will mean CapEx is expected more in the range of $800 million to $1 billion.","Third, with growth, there is also some natural investments in working capital. Practically, I expect these to show up as step-ups in inventory and receivables across our business. Logically, these will support our growth engine in seed and traits globally and will help adjust through the steady-state environment of our Ag Productivity business.","Our 2012 performance positions us well to both continue our cash generation in 2013 and support our continuing opportunity, and this naturally leads me to how I think about using that cash. Because we are committed to converting earnings into operating cash, I view that cash as an important tool in continuing to invest prudently for growth in the business and return value to our share owners. So we will focus our cash development around investments and acquisition opportunities that build our business footprint and technology capability, but we will also maintain our focus on returning value to our share owners through share buybacks and consistently paying out a portion of our earnings as dividends.","While an earnings call like this turns the attention to the fiscal year ahead of us, there are 2 pieces of context I don't want to lose as we lay out guidance: First, our priority in 2012 was to deliver on our guidance, and we did that. With ongoing earnings growth per share of 25%, we have a strong business engine in place that sets up 2013. Second, as CFO, I want to see our business strategy translate to our financial statements. With the operation plans Brett laid out, we have a very good line of sight of the detail that drives our opportunity, and that reinforces my confidence in our ability to deliver the next layer of growth in 2013.","With that, let me turn it back to Bryan for the Q&A period.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Pierre. We'd now like to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, Rob, I think we're ready to take any questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wondering -- I guess I'll actually ask a non-fundamental question. Your -- You generated -- or you now have $1.2 billion in net cash and your cash balance grew by $711 million, and your dividend is $642 million. So I'm just curious. I know you bought some businesses as well this year. I'm just curious, why not raise the dividend more than you have? Or what should we be thinking about along those lines?","Pierre Courduroux","So thanks for the question, Vincent. Well, the way we've been thinking about our deployment of cash, I mean, has been very consistent over the last couple of years. I mean, we are committed to growing our business. And as you mentioned, we've been making some investments and acquiring a couple of companies. And this is still an area we are actively looking into. And in terms of the return of the cash to the share owners, our board allowed us another $1-billion buyback plan. And as you mentioned, we've also raised our dividends by 25% in the previous quarter. So we are very, very conscious of returning the cash to our share owner in a disciplined way as well. And one of the key things is the sustainability of the commitments we make. So when we raised our dividend 25%, we are very committed to continuing this growth and being very focused on that, but we also have to manage the opportunities we have on the acquisition side. So it's always a balance we have to maintain. We've been very active last year. I mean, actually, over the last couple of years, we returned twice about $1.1 billion to our share owners in between dividends and buyback. And that's really something we are focused on.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think maybe Brett commented that the full season corn numbers in South America might be a little bit lower as farmers plant more soy acreage. So I'm wondering if you could just talk about the profit implications there. And then secondly, what you might expect in the summer corn season and maybe the relative intensity of hybrid corn in both those seasons.","Hugh Grant","Bob, thanks for your question. I think you really hit at the heart of one of the issues that Brett talked about this morning. So I'll ask him to say a few words, but the way I think about this is we feel really great about the season. And as Pierre mentioned, we see the first quarter shaping up to be very, very significant. So if you don't lose sleep in the quarter and you look at the total season in Latin America, it's shaping up real nice. But, Brett, maybe a few words between first season and second season corn.","Brett D. Begemann","Thanks, Hugh. Bob, I think that something that's really relevant in South America, is the fact that farmers have that option to look both at first and second season. So with the commodity prices pointing them towards soybeans in the first season, it -- many of them are going that way, which will put pressure on corn acres, but they have the opportunity to come back in the second season, where we expect that acres will rebound in corn, particularly in Brazil, to where you won't see such a substantial reduction for the whole year. But to Hugh's point, the season is setting up very well. As we track our business, looking at how our orders match up with our expectations for our first quarter, we're very much on track.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a two-part question. In your goals for the Genuity family in corn for 2013, you're up to 36 to 38 million acres. Will you be roughly fully penetrated at that point? Because that 36 to 38 million acres, I think, is about equal to your branded corn acres in the United States. And secondly, I think your target this year was to grow your offshore gross profit at the same rate as your -- or to have your incremental gross profit be half U.S. and half offshore. How did you actually do? That is, you grew about $1 billion in gross profit. How much came from the U.S.? And how much came from offshore?","Hugh Grant","Some of the -- I'll maybe ask Brett to say a few words on potential and Pierre on gross profit. The headline, Jeff, on corn is if you look at this year and you look at next year, corn is the driver for Monsanto. So corn growth is really our wheelhouse. And we saw, Pierre, 25% GP growth year-on-year in corn. So it's doing very well and a big piece of that is the platform. So, Brett, maybe a quick word on platforms. And then, Pierre, a dissection on domestic versus international.","Brett D. Begemann","Sure. If you look at the U.S. this year, it's another significant step-up in our refuge-reducing family, looking at 36 to 38 million acres. But that's not necessarily the end, Jeff. You should think about it in the context of the whole market and recognize that VT Double PRO RIB Complete is a part of that now, which starts to expand that bigger than where we used to be with the old triples, which is the measuring stick that often gets used. So there is still growth beyond what we see that we're going to this next year.","Pierre Courduroux","And as for the breakdown of gross profit in '12 and in '13, I mean, the way we've been thinking about that is, I mean, we've got 2 growth engine: one in the U.S. and the other one x U.S., with the x U.S. growing faster from a smaller base. And both in 2012 and 2013, we are expecting to see, I mean, equivalent growth. I mean, the breakdown, as we mentioned, is -- will be depending on how the business evolves during the year. But we are really looking at those 2 engines to provide about the same level of gross profit growth.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, right. So what happened in '12?","Pierre Courduroux","We were about this half and half, very close to that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of things on Latin America. When do you expect the China approval for Intacta? And could the Intacta ramp be faster than any of your previous products, because you would have had 2 years of groundbreaking -- Ground Breakers trials? Related to that, if I may ask one more about -- you mentioned that Argentina has been a challenge to get paid in Argentina. I was just curious about your gross margins in corn in Brazil versus Argentina.","Hugh Grant","Okay. So thanks for the 2 questions. So the way I would think about Intacta, over 10 years, we've learned that you never speculate on regulatory approvals or when they're going to come. But our position hasn't changed. So 2013 is all market activity. So it's getting the product in more farmers' hands, getting on more acres and continuing to expose the technology to growers. And then 2014 is our commercialization phase. So we said from the get-go that '13 would always be de minimis and that '14 would be the year. And I feel -- I continue to feel confident from a Chinese point of view that we will meet that '13, '14 timeline in terms of expanding Ground Breakers. In terms of acceleration, I mean, it's hard -- we're talking about something happening in '14. It's hard to say but everything I hear from growers down there, there's tremendous enthusiasm. There's a lot of pent-up demand. They're now relearning the system. It's an intuitive shift. So I think it's going to be big, and I think it's going to be big fast. And then in corn, a quick word on...","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, yes, regarding the specific question around the margin, P.J., regarding corn in between Brazil and Argentina, you're looking at very similar types of margin in both countries because remember, I mean, the corn, being a hybrid, I mean, you don't have the issue you had in Argentina with soybeans. So the value-capture mechanism are about the same and the level of margins you're looking into are very similar in both countries.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You've given your forecast for flattish corn acres in the U.S. for next year. Do you think you can grow corn volume and gain corn share in the U.S.? And do you have the seed supply to do both?","Hugh Grant","Yes and yes. So it's kind of interesting because we're sitting here on the run-up to Thanksgiving and we're talking about flattish acres of a number of 96 million acres. I think that the country's got the absolute capacity to plant that much, and there's a pent-up demand for that kind of volume. It's going to get down to what sort of spring. The country has to get 96 million acres in the ground. But based on the momentum that we've established this year and looking at the performance differentials in our germplasm, we feel pretty good about our supply and we feel pretty good about our performance leverage. So the early feedback from growers has been very encouraging, and I think the team has done a really nice job on our pricing. So never done until it's done, David, but I'd say the outlook is pretty good.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just very quickly, any comments on the impact of the farm bill kerfuffle on order patterns in the U.S. in Q1 versus Q2? And as you look at the 5% to 6% advantage for DEKALB, as you look at the advant [ph] changes in your breeding platform, can that -- can you break out of that and get better than a 6% advantage versus your peers in 2 to 3 years?","Hugh Grant","So on the farm bill, no. I'd say no impact. Obviously, growers are watching that, but the headline this year was a really tough drought and a very early harvest, and they're looking at knocking out of the ballpark next year. So there's an anticipation of support, but I don't think it had any impact on our book patterns. And then, Brett, if you -- I don't know if you had any comments.","Brett D. Begemann","Yes, I think to the other part of your question on the yields and the differential, we're obviously extremely pleased with the differential that we're seeing this year in a really tough year, which is really consistent with what we've seen in the outstanding years before. Keep in mind the point I made though. As you go to fully traited products and you start looking at things like DroughtGard coming into our portfolio, Corn Rootworm III coming into our portfolio, we start to balance out that whole portfolio and we're looking at the absolute performance of the overall system. So yes, I think there is a real world opportunity for us to continue to drive our advantage in the marketplace as we build out that portfolio of products.","Hugh Grant","Here's just an extraordinary factoid. We had our second best yielding year in probably the worst crop year in 30 or 40 years. And I think that really underscores the durability of the genetics, and it shows that even in really tough years, you see that performance shining through.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","You talked about slower opportunity next year in cotton in the U.S., which obviously isn't too surprising. Can you tell us what happened in this fourth quarter, which looks a little light, and how much of that was India and what your outlook for India is next year for cotton?","Pierre Courduroux","So as you mentioned, the final results in cotton in the fourth quarter was -- were lower than what we've seen in the previous year. So the first place to start with is something we had been talking about since the first quarter. This is the reduction coming from the pull-forward in the first quarter of some Australian revenues, which was accounting for about $0.05 of EPS. So this one aside, we had larger returns actually than we thought we were going to get in the U.S. So this has been driving part of the downside. And we've also, I mean, mentioned the fact that in India, we were not looking at a great year there and it's also been part of the equation. But the largest part, definitely, has been Australia, which we were anticipating, and then the pullback of acres in the U.S. and also to a certain extent in India. When we look at next year, we're looking at, I mean, acres pullback of anywhere in between 10% and 20% across the globe. So that's why we are conservative and willing to signal that we're not expecting our cotton next year to be outperforming.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","10% to 20%, okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Advisors.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Hugh, you obviously performed very nicely this year, certainly year-over-year and certainly relative to your guidance. So speaking of that, what couple of factors would you attribute doing materially better than your original guidance? And likewise, as we look out at -- assuming we have this call on October 2013 and you do better than your original guidance, what might be the areas of upside there? And conversely, should you not perform as well as your expectations, what might be the areas that might be the factors behind that?","Hugh Grant","Thanks for the question, Frank. So I am very pleased with the performance this year. And the point we made in the call is '13 is a continuation of '12. So I think from your question -- the logic flow from your question is what we set out in '12 in terms of performance momentum carries into '13. And then if you dial that down a notch, a big piece here is cotton performance. And obviously, a piece of that is driven by acres albeit in a tough year, and we're anticipating that those acres will come back next year. So it's the strength of technology, the performance of cotton, the conservatism in our pricing, and that sets up the momentum that we're getting. It's never done until it's planted in the ground, but the early feedback from our grower customers has been very positive as we look into '13. So that's how it's set up, and I'm delighted with the performance this year. I'm really pleased on cash generation. And the dilemma of how we repatriate that cash is a really great problem to have, but that's how we look at '12 and '13. It's that the heart of this is corn. But the second one I would call out is really compelling performance in our soybean platform. And we've been aggressively switching those technologies, and that yield data is still coming in, Frank. We'll update you later in the season. But the early read on our soybean platform has been very, very encouraging.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is there a geography that you can point to that you think might be a source of upside for you?","Hugh Grant","You mean globally?","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Hugh Grant","Well, we -- I mean, we talked a little bit about Latin America and Eastern Europe and -- 10 years ago, hard to believe we've been talking about Eastern Europe, but we see -- we're going to have to invest and we're going to have to spend CapEx to unlock those markets. But we see continued opportunity in technification in Brazil and Argentina. And in the mid-term, we see real opportunity in Eastern Europe.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Hugh, I wanted to follow up on U.S. corn pricing and your outlook there. You've talked about overall realizations being up 5% to 10%. My understanding was you were closer to 10% in 2012. Are you just being conservative this early in the season? Because I would think between your genetics renewal, the mix upgrade and certainly even less discounting than last year, that there is potential for further upside in corn pricing in -- or greater growth rather in '13 than in '12.","Hugh Grant","Don, thanks for the question. I'd maybe ask Brett to jump in here. But the way I would think about it is the pricing is done. It's largely done. So it's communicated and then -- and we were early communicating pricing this year because it was important, as growers were getting in the fields and looking at depleted yields, that they knew where they stood. So we've priced our portfolio. The industry, I think, is pretty much priced now, Brett. So the upside is going to be on, I guess, how aggressive the discounting is and how swiftly the season goes. But we've pretty much baked that cake and it's -- the stall is set out in that 5% to 10% range one more time. So it's going to get done on performance and volume and also the mix effect with technification. We're seeing really, really nice lift as growers look for those high-tech, better performing products. But, Brett, I don't know if you've got anything that you'd like to add.","Brett D. Begemann","Just a short add-on on the end of what Hugh was describing on the mix effect. Hugh said so. When you think about the 5% to 10%, that's what happened this past year to move us towards the higher end. It's the opportunity for next year as we drive to the higher-traited packages in the marketplace that give us the biggest lift, and that's where we'll see that occurring, so -- but all the rest of the details are out there. So I don't see it being significant at this point.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And, Brett, just a clarification. You said corn market share up more than 1%. How much more than 1%? And was all that growth due to VT Double PRO?","Brett D. Begemann","Well, all the growth was not due to VT Double PRO. It was a significant contributor to our growth, but it wasn't all that. Our entire portfolio grew very nicely across the whole U.S. this year, and we're clearly up more than a point when I look at all the numbers. But you know as well as I do, there's so many moving parts on that with what were the absolute acres and harvested acres, et cetera, et cetera. So I feel really good about -- it's more than 1 point, but to qualify it much tighter than that's difficult to do.","Hugh Grant","But you'd say in corn and beans probably the best year in the last 3.","Brett D. Begemann","Definitely the best in the last 3.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question on your capital budget for fiscal 2013. If I look at the range of $800 million to $1 billion and take the midpoint there, it looks like it's up perhaps 35% to 40% versus the $646 million that you spent this year. So I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on some of the drivers behind that in terms of key projects and whether or not there might have been any deferral of expenditures out of '12 and into '13, just to help us understand the increase a little bit better.","Pierre Courduroux","No, actually, Kevin. And that's a great question and we tried to touch on it in the discussion previously. What we are recognizing today is that based on the strength we've seen outside of the U.S., both in Eastern Europe, in Argentina and in Brazil, I mean, we now feel very comfortable that over the next couple of years, we are going to be needing more capacity to provide the market because we've enjoyed real success in those 3 areas. And this is where, definitely, we're going to be putting some steel on the ground to increase our manufacturing capacity in those area. And really, the comparison from 1 year to the other is linked to those incremental production capacity that we're going to be putting on the ground. So that's really -- we are now at a point where we feel very comfortable that we can invest in those countries, because we've got the market to support those capacity.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just as a follow-up, Pierre, is it seed production that you're investing? And what sort of specific investments would you envision?","Pierre Courduroux","So this is definitely seed production. I mean, it's dryers. It's, I mean, really, seed manufacturing capacity that we are investing in Eastern Europe, Brazil and Argentina.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Picken of Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Just a couple of quick questions. Just touching on the vegetable business, if you could kind of walk us through what type of growth rate you might expect for fiscal '13, and when you think about kind of between Europe and the U.S., kind of where that growth is coming from. And then similarly, just on cotton. I know we've touched a little bit on India, but if you could touch a little bit on Australia as well because that sometimes is a driver in the first quarter.","Hugh Grant","Yes. Michael, thank you. Pierre, maybe you can say a few words. And I think, veggies, this isn't going to be a breakout year, but it will be a return to normalization. And then cotton, there is a lot of moving parts between India, Australia and then shrinking acres here at home.","Pierre Courduroux","Yes. When we are looking at our veggie business, the way we've been planning, I mean, obviously within a range of different outcomes, but we are looking at single-digit growth this year for our veggie business. We've been redeploying our resources. And you mentioned the U.S. and Europe. Actually, the --- as we mentioned in previous calls, the veggie business is redeploying towards the Middle East, towards North Africa, towards Eastern Europe, and we are reflecting those changes in our planning. I mean, we are expecting now that the Europe business will be stabilized. We are still seeing growth in the American business. And most of the growth is going to happen in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe. So that's the way we've been planning. I mean, obviously, if there is any opportunity it will be there, but that's the way we've been planning, so single-digit growth as far as our veggie business is concerned. Regarding cotton, I mean, you mentioned Australia as one key factor. So we're not expecting the performance in Australia to be as good as it was last year, but we are still looking at high acres, planted acres, in Australia. There is water in Australia. It may not be as good as what we enjoyed this year. So specifically about Australia, this is not the area where we're going to see the massive pullback. We'll see the pullback in the U.S., India mostly. So that's the way we've been planning.","Bryan Hurley","And Rob, this is Bryan. I think we're running just a tad bit long. So that's probably the last question we have time for. Maybe if we could shift to just a quick summary by Hugh before we close so that we try to respect everybody's time here.","Hugh Grant","Thanks very much, Bryan. So thanks again for joining us on the call this morning. I think as you hear our remarks and also the questions, we turn our focus to 2013 today and the opportunity that we see in the new fiscal year. And there is real opportunity in this new fiscal year. We're optimistic in how we see that playing out. So let me try and summarize in 3 points how we see this setting up:","First of all, we, here at Monsanto, feel very good about 2012. We focused on our customers and we recaptured the momentum in our business, and we put together back-to-back years that underscore our growth mode.","I feel equally good about 2013 as a continuation of '12. We'll continue our strategy, and that gives us a clearer line of sight on our growth than we've had in some previous years. And that, in turn, reinforces our confidence.","And finally, as we highlight our growth in 2013, it's growth that's really underpinned by strong operational plans, and Brett covered some of them today. It's also coming from more sources on a more global scale. And that, obviously, speaks to increased CapEx and expansion. And that underscores what we see as our continuing opportunity against a backdrop of a world that needs more agricultural productivity over a long runway.","So thank you very much for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing these plans as they unfold in 2013 with you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"14815":["Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call  October  8, 2014  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Bryan Hurley - IR","Hugh Grant - Chairman and CEO","Brett Begemann - President and COO","Pierre Courduroux - CFO","Analysts","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Christopher Parkinson - Credit Suisse ","Don Carson - Susquehanna International Group ","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","Mark Connelly - CLSA","Jeff Zekauskas - J.P.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you, you may begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thank you, Jessie, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings update. I am joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer as well as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Tim Boeker, and Laura Meyer.","This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP and on an ongoing business basis where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the Company\u2019s actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent period report of the SEC and in today\u2019s press release.","This morning, our focus is on the outlook for our next fiscal year where we expect to deliver continuing strong growth. While today\u2019s call will focus on that outlook, let me set up the conversation with the couple of key points from our fiscal year \u201814 results on Slide 4. With yearend ongoing EPS of $5.23 and free cash flow of $959 million, our final results came in ahead of our updated guidance. Just as importantly, we said a priority in 2014 was to demonstrate Seeds and Genomics would return as the biggest driver of our growth, and with the final results, Seeds and Genomics delivered the majority of our gross profit growth creating the right momentum as we think about what matters in 2015.","So with that, let me hand it to Hugh to take us through our updates this morning and the next step in our growth outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line. The fourth quarter is traditionally the point where we focus on the outlook for the next 12 months. That look forward is particularly important as we set up our fiscal year \u201915. And even with the more challenging commodity environment, Monsanto is set to deliver strong growth both in the near-term and over a multiyear horizon. We closed the fiscal year \u201814 a bit above our earnings guidance demonstrating our ability to deliver growth against more headwinds and marking our fourth consecutive year of strong earnings growth. We expect our growth to continue in 2015. ","Let me share the key themes in that 2015 outlook as laid out in Slide 5. First, it begins with who we\u2019re. We\u2019re a growth company. Our opportunity is built on innovation, our value to our farmer customers as a technology provider, and we have a portfolio and product pipeline that separates us from the commodity world. That sets up the most important theme in our outlook, 2015 as a leverage year for Monsanto, in which we\u2019re able to commit the strong growth today and at the same time step up significant incremental investments to unlock future growth. ","There are a few companies as well positioned to dedicate a level of spending to deliver truly transformational long-term platforms while maintaining tangible near-term growth. This is an either\/or situation of growth or investment. We plan to do both in 2015, and that\u2019s the key opportunity this year.","As we deliver growth in 2015, as we stay focused in our customers, and as we continue to invest to unlock new growth, we can widen our long-term competitive position in an industry that\u2019s particularly near-term focused right now. There is no doubt that our 2015 growth is important, and we\u2019re really focused on delivery. This morning, we laid out our EPS guidance to $5.75 to $6 reinforcing our confidence and our ability to deliver the double-digit to mid-teens growth that we targeted for 2015. That confidence comes directly from the strength in our core business as there is no hesitation that our seeds-and-traits engine is set to deliver strong growth that\u2019s the pace setter for our EPS growth this year.","So in a year where delivery matters, we\u2019ll be clear about how that growth plays out. This year, the industry will certainly face the headwinds of a more challenging agricultural environment. We\u2019re not immune, and our guidance factors that in, but our more balanced global business also gives us more tools to manage the puts and takes. The proof of that came in 2014 as soybean emerged as a true differentiator balancing the shifts in the global corn environment. With macro factors that change every year and a business that has become more global, the pattern of the flow of the business through the year has been changing. That will be true again in 2015. Brett and Pierre will cover the key factors, but practically we\u2019d expect the shift that creates a smaller Q1 and builds growth as we reach our large market seasons over the course of the year. 2015 is also a year where we\u2019ve more tools. We\u2019re now more aggressively using the strength of our cash generation and our balance sheet providing a structural benefit through a $10 billion share buyback program that supports our growth of returning more value to our owners.","So, all of that\u2019s important because it sets up the opportunity beyond one year, and that\u2019s my final theme. Over the course of 2014, we took a bolder approach and outlined the five-year target to at least double our ongoing EPS, and we feel as good today as we did when we outlined our goals both in the near-term springboard of 2015 and the multiyear path. At macro level, the fundamentals of agriculture on slide six continue to be compelling. Global grain demand is expected to grow every year through the end of the decade. The reality is with grain stocks replenished from this year\u2019s harvest, we\u2019re in a better position to meet normalized demand; and there are already the first signs of increased use across exports, ethanol, and animal feed. And given availability, costs in the environmental footprint, I think new acres isn\u2019t likely to be the long-term answer to this demand.","So, the world needs to increase the rate of gain seen in the last five years by around 2x in corn and by 5x in soybeans just to meet baseline demand. That means yield and innovation are going to matter more than ever, and that\u2019s who we are. At company level, we\u2019ve more clear catalysts and more levers across our business than we\u2019ve ever had before. And that\u2019s furthered by our focus on next-generation platforms that have the potential to be transformational in our growth horizon, so our roadmap over the next five years is in place and it\u2019s just clear as it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s not distant growth at the backend of the decade. We\u2019ll expect strong growth in 2015 that builds a cadence of consistent growth carrying from 2016 to 2019.","We\u2019ve everything that we need to make it happen and we\u2019re focused on execution. Perhaps more importantly for the long-term opportunity, this is a gateway year for our strategy, technology, and opportunity can actually extend our leadership position and unlock the next leg of growth over the next five years in our business. So with that, let me hand it to Brett, to walk you through the operational plans to back up this outlook. Brett?","Brett Begemann","","Thanks Hugh and good morning to everyone on the line. We are anchored on a five-year growth opportunity on slide 7. The opportunity to at least double our ongoing earnings per share by 2019 is a compelling target that speaks to our confidence and growth this year and for the remainder of the decade, and we\u2019re on pace about what we need to deliver in the first year. Just as importantly, we haven\u2019t lost sight of our customers as they deal with software commodities and macro tradeoffs. We have made progress and applied our learnings over the past few years. So being consistent and staying close to our customers this year is important in holding that momentum so that we\u2019re in a good long-term position as agriculture comes out of this transition.","From that, we\u2019ve built our operational plans, and there are three key factors on slide 8, I\u2019m focused on this year. Number one is seeds-and-traits growth. Simply put, we expect seeds-and-traits deliver double-digit gross profit growth, which is the primary driver of our earnings growth. Number two, seeds-and-traits is balanced against our continued strategic management of the Roundup business. Overall, we feel good about the expected full year Ag productivity contribution for 2015 as well as the long-term steady state outlook. We do however expect the contribution from our Ag productivity business to soften in 2015 as the overall market normalizes after a strong 2014.","The biggest variable in 2015 is actually the timing of Ag productivity earnings more than any strategic factor. We would expect the majority of the year-over-year earnings decrease shows up in Q1 reflecting some changes in timing and product mix as we\u2019ve moved more of our volume in \u201915 from the non-branded supply business to sales in our flagship brands. Number three; this is a year where the strength in our core business will allow us to aggressively invest to drive climate and other new platforms. Against those factors the metrics that matter this year are on slide 9. First, we\u2019re going to build on the record soybean year in 2014 as we expected to become one of our most meaningful platforms and the first of our billion dollar plus growth drivers.","Soybeans were real differentiator in 2014, providing the offset to the macro corn shifts that record setting year and soybeans also drove our bottom line results providing the business lift for us to reach the high end of our overall guidance. The biggest contributor in 2015 is clearly the Intacta opportunity in Latin America on slide 10. We are on track with the 10 million to 12 million acre target we laid out, marking a record second year adoption pace for a soybean trade. ","Penetration of Intacta at this level effectively places us at the tipping point of adoption in FY15 and sets us on an accelerating trajectory across soybeans over the next few years. That\u2019s furthered by Roundup Ready 2 Xtend on slide 11, which moves into the final commercial preparation in 2015, setting up soybeans for a multi-trade multi-geography opportunity covering a market of almost 200 million acres in North and South America during our five year growth horizon.","That accelerating soybean opportunity is backed by $2 billion plus platforms in our global corn business. In 2014, we increased our corn margins even as our corn business absorbed several $100 million at the GP level from lower acres and currency effects. That came from a couple of strategic metrics; our COGS were lower; our portfolio mix was on track; our total price was positive and we had good volume against declining planted acres. That carries us into 2015 where the growth opportunity comes from a combination of those same strategic drivers.","First, the most important factor is our portfolio upgrade on slide 12. This is structural because it ties directly to our ability to enter this new better performing products every year and the track record bears that out regardless of the environment we\u2019ve increased our average price in our portfolio every year in the last decade. Our 2015 strategy reflects that, the portfolio is in place, price cards are out in the Northern Hemisphere and we see mix benefit from our portfolio lift. We continue to see that uplift in the range of a mid-single digit benefit and that provides a consistent contribution across our global portfolio.","The second factor is the continued expansion of our underlying footprint in corn on slide 13. Practically, we don\u2019t expect overall planted acres to make a significant rebound in 2015. In key regions like Latin America shifts away from corn planting are likely to create further headwinds. However, in other regions like Eastern Europe, there continues to be opportunity for added volume. Against that, we expect our footprint to expand and that comes from two sources, continued growth in established markets along with our opportunity in newer emerging markets, the ability to grow our volume in a declining macro market demonstrates there is resilient demand as we continue to deliver the best performing products.","Lastly, we also expect some continuation of the COGS benefits. While, obviously not as pronounced as it was last year, we do expect some residual cost tailwinds. One additional element on slide 14 that ties these drivers to our added focus on our farmer customers revolves around our multichannel distribution approach in the U.S. This is a key differentiator. We\u2019re able to meet farmers wherever they prefer to buy their seed, giving us more touch points for the key seed decision. The anchor of that strategy remains the full service reach with our retail partners, and that doesn\u2019t change.","But within our regional brands our customers also told us there is more opportunity to further the relationship component for the direct-to-grower brands, so we\u2019ve evolved our Channel seed brand to a model with even more of a direct-to-grower sales force, so they spend more time on the ground with farmers while shifting supply chain activities to us where we excel. That results in a change that shifts the timing of some sales within a year where we want to stay close to our customers it allows us to leverage our sales force that is highly motivated by day-to-day relationships with the grower. Over the long-term, that also furthers the footprint expansion opportunity in our largest market.","It\u2019s clear that corn and soybeans are the drivers but our outlook also factors in the rest of our portfolio. Our other crops including vegetables and cotton complement the core with an expected modest steady contribution. Cotton is among our most international operations with significant contribution from the U.S., India and Australia. We expect nice growth from the U.S. and importantly, the first proof point in our Roundup Ready 2 Xtend opportunity as we expect to launch this Xtend platform in cotton in 2015. That\u2019s offset early in the year by some macro trends as the Australia market is highly relying on water availability and the current draught is likely to drive acres down significantly. It\u2019s a small but high value market so while we expect good overall cotton growth, Australia will be a negative in Q1 and the growth through the year will be more aligned to the U.S. and Indian seasons.","The performance in the core business becomes a leverage point as we use 2015 to accelerate our new platforms the most notable is our Climate Corporation platform on slide 15. 2014 served as an important foundation year with better than anticipated progress as we combine the climate capability with Monsanto. In fact, our base tools were used on nearly one and three U.S. corn and soybean acres this year, giving us a significant head start in making this a true industry relevant platform. In 2015, we\u2019ll do three big things; we\u2019ll step up our investment to leverage that head start; we\u2019ll cultivate further enrollment on the platform by increasing our active climate users by another 50%; and we\u2019ll take the first steps in building the runway with a focus on our entry level Premium Climate Pro offering. On that upgrade, we\u2019re applying the core Monsanto experience by building a value ladder of multiple offerings at multiple price points to incentivize trial and establish value, very similar to how we\u2019ve thought about our biotech traits over the years. This makes it an important springboard in establishing the portfolio that will become a staple of our strategy moving forwards and part of our long-term growth opportunity.","Taken together, here\u2019s how I think about the operational summary. There\u2019s no doubt, it\u2019s a challenging year for agriculture and our customers. However, because of the products and platforms we have we can grow in that environment. Just as importantly we\u2019re focused on the year at hand but for us this is really about the runway of opportunity that begins in 2015. From here, each of the growth drivers becomes materially larger in 2016 and beyond unlocking the next wave of Monsanto\u2019s growth to the end of the decade.","With that let me hand it to Pierre to walk you through the financials. Pierre.","Pierre Courduroux","","Thanks Brett and good morning to everyone on the line. As CFO my priority is to have a clear view of the factors that influence our financial performance, those that we directly control as well as those that are beyond our control. So let me build on Hugh and Brett\u2019s outlook through that lens on Slide 16.","First, there is no hesitation that we can deliver growth in 2015 and doing so in a challenging environment is an important validation for our business. The current environment as people asking whether Ag companies can grow and we have our guidance for 2015, we\u2019re clear and are confident that Monsanto can deliver strong double-digit to mid-teens EPS growth. Second and importantly, we expect this growth to come from the right place and clearly from our seeds-and-traits engine. And this growth comes even after we incorporate the impact of the overall macro headwinds we have set from our Ag productivity business and a step up in our spending to fund future growth. And third, the financial discipline we have demonstrated over the last few years will be a critical component to deliver our financials in 2015. This is a key element we control, so while we won\u2019t lose the opportunity to invest in our pipelines and new platforms we will match that with discipline across our cost base with the priority on delivering our financial results.","And likewise our new capital allocation approach provides us with more tools to leverage the strength of our cash generation and balance sheet while supporting our growth and returning value to our owners.","So let me start the detail look with the key elements and assumptions underlying our guidance on Slide 17. Our earnings guidance up 575 to $6 per share is consistent with the double-digit to mid-teens earnings growth that we targeted coming into the year. In tandem, we expect to generate $2 billion to $2.2 billion of free cash flow as we expect to see our earnings also translate into few cash growth.","There is a simple four piece way to think about our outlook. Our core business is the overwriting driver of growth. There are two key offsets in Ag productivity and in our increasing investment in spending that each tamper several points of that growth and finally our buybacks then round outs the supporting benefit. Let me give you the details. First and foremost as I said the primary driver is our core seeds-and-traits engine where we expect to deliver double-digit growth on the GP line. We anticipate more than three quarters of that overall GP contribution comes from our two core corn and soybean businesses. From there, we expect smaller, steady contributions from the rest of our seeds-and-traits portfolio.","Within these gross profit outlook, our guidance builds in a realistic view on the current environment. As Brett mentioned with the decreasing acres in the Latin America summer season we don\u2019t see a significant rebound in planted corn acres in key regions this year. Additionally, our outlook builds in a prudent view of the current conditions around global currency as we anticipate similar currency movements as last year. So our guidance incorporates limited erosion for the key global currencies in 2015.","And this also ties to the political landscape where we also anticipate some of the terminal that has been a reality in places like Argentina and the Ukraine will continue, although our 2015 guidance assumes reasonable operating environments in both regions. Key offsets to the seeds-and-traits growth at the total gross profit level is the Ag productivity segments. Practically we expect the peak pricing environment we have seen in glyphosate last year may soften some. And as a result, our guidance assumes Ag productivity gross profit as the potential to be down in the range of 10% offsetting some of the coal growth from our seeds-and-traits engine. The second important offset is our spending as our outlook factors in a disciplined near-term increase in operating expenses. Very specifically, given the transformational opportunity in our new platforms and particularly in our climate corporation platform we are putting extra investment in SG&A and R&D to build on our acquisition and accelerate the long-term opportunity. For fiscal \u201915 the total operating spend in new platform is expected in the range of $350 million, we\u2019re presenting an incremental $150 million of our total 2014 expense. Increasing our operating expense is not something I take lightly; it becomes a priority because we believe the long-term opportunity is compelling and because we have the strength in the core business to support it. Importantly that conscious new platform spend is balanced against our base business operating expenses where we expect only inflation level increases in SG&A and R&D as we take a disciplined approach to our overall expense management.","This final factor in the financial outlook is the net effect of share buyback program. The benefit of the share count reduction is balanced by significant step up in interest expenses related to our debt offering in June. Depending on the balance and timing of our share repurchase, we anticipate the net effect to provide a positive contribution of around 4% to 5% to our total EPS growth in 2015, largely coming in the second-half.","The next point in the delivery year is being very clear on how that guidance flows through the annual earnings pattern, on slide 18. As Hugh mentioned, our business has expanded globally over the past several years and with that we\u2019ve seen the earnings flow evolve between quarters, this is equally trailing 2015, so let me walk you through the expected earnings flow for this year.","Basically, we anticipate a shift in the full year flow that creates a smaller Q1 and the concentration growth in Q3 and that comes from several key trends. First, the macro environment doesn\u2019t effect on two key parts of the business in Q1. Most prominently the reduced planted corn acres in Latin America affect the quarterly corn contribution and are magnified against the relatively small earning space in the quarter. Likewise, the Australian cotton business that Brett mentioned is also a factor in Q1. As acres are expected to be roughly half of the prior season; we expect an equivalent reduction in Q1 cotton gross profit. Second, several of the business factors Brett mentioned also translate to some shifts in our earnings flow.","The most important in Q1 comes from Ag productivity volumes. A key piece is a timing shift that comes from one of its key structural benefits of our Roundup strategy. This year we are able to move more of our volume from contracts in the lower supply business to our flagship brands creating a mix benefit and this reduction in the supply volume is largest in Q1 and the increase in the branded business is largest in Q3 which aligns to the over-the-top markets in the Northern Hemisphere. Including that shift we did expect the Q1 Ag productivity GP contribution to be about 75% of what it was last year.","That means that the majority of the full year Ag productivity downside that we discussed actually would be incorporated in Q1 and the branded volume will translate to greater percent of revenues in the second-half of the year. Beyond Q1 the biggest first-half effect is the modification in our Channel seeds brand which creates a shift in the revenue flow. In FY \u201915, we will book sales as we ship seeds to the grower, rather than the historical pattern where we booked sales with seed shipments to distributors that change is expected to shift several hundred million dollars of GP from Q1 and Q2 into our third quarter.","So together those factors have the most effect on Q1 and we will be better from there to reach our full year GP and earnings growth in the second-half of the year. we expect Q1 to come in at about roughly half of their total earnings from last year\u2019s Q1, we expect Q2 to be roughly flat year-over-year, but expect to see significant uptick in Q3 earnings as a majority of our full year growth flows through that quarter and this will be punctuated by the Q4 that is likely to be breakeven to positive on an absolute basis.","The last piece I want to cover today is our cash generation and use on slide 19. Fiscal \u201915 will mark a rebound year for free cash generation as we don\u2019t anticipate having the effects of the outlay for the climate corporation acquisition or the Novozymes alliance. More importantly at the level of 2 billion to 2.2 billion in cash generation, we expect to see conversion of growth into cash. The second piece of that is our cash use. Since we announced our new capital allocation strategy in June, we\u2019ve had a very successful debt offering that setup the first installment of our 10 billion share buybacks through an accelerated share repurchase program, that is a strong initial step in our more aggressive use of capital and this sets us up to continue to prioritize returning value to our owners.","Today I focused a lot on the mechanics of our plan, but let me end by stepping back and reinforcing why delivering in 2015 become such an important point of leverage for ongoing growth on slide 18. From a financial perspective I have focused on three legs of our strategy financial discipline, business growth and the ability to return value to share owners. Today we are more balanced global business that's capable of delivering real growth even against micro viability just as importantly we are a company that has strong embedded organic growth and meaningful new platforms in place to date and we got ability to use our cash generation and balance sheet even more strategically we have the tools to continue a step to focus on shareholder value, that is more powerful than just the growth this year. It\u2019s truly the course of confidence and the opportunity as we target at least doubling our ongoing EPS in five years and outcome only a company that innovates in the space and deliver. Thanks. And I\u2019ll hand it back to Bryan for the Q&A. ","Bryan Hurley","","Thanks Pierre. So with that we\u2019d now like to open the call for questions as we typically do I\u2019ll ask that you please hold your question to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. So Jessie I think we\u2019re ready to take the questions from the line now. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Brett, maybe you could just comment a little bit. I guess it is early days in the order book for next year in the US, but you said price cards are out. Presumably you have seen the competitor price cards. Is there anything that is going on that is deviating from your expectations in terms of where sort of the overall market is both in terms of price points on new and older products as well as maybe timing of order discounts or anything like that? Are you expecting the order book to fill a little slower this year just given the corn price and uncertainty around acreage?","Hugh Grant ","","Yes, thanks Vincent and good morning. I think, first of all it\u2019s important to put this all in the context of what the farmers are facing right now. The last report I looked at where we\u2019re running at about 50% of the five year average for harvest, it\u2019s been really wet across the big corn and soy belt and it\u2019s slowed down harvest, so as you can imagine that\u2019s what the focus of farmers has been. So there has been some slow-down in their anticipation and looking at what they\u2019re going to do on seed choices. But to your point, our price cards have been out, our competitor price cards are out there, supply situations are similar to last year where we all have ample supply, and I would tell you at this point that we feel comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned in the market place and feel good about moving forwards.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","When would you -- usually Thanksgiving is kind of the point in time where -- right after Thanksgiving, where you have a sense of where the order book is and at least how through the first half is shaping up. Do you think that is going to be later this year? Should we be thinking more towards the first of the year, or what do you think there? ","Hugh Grant ","","This time Vincent as I mention the farmers are totally focused on getting harvest, I don\u2019t see anything. It doesn\u2019t say it\u2019s going to be a pretty challenging harvest for our customers this year. The weather continues to be wet, there is a lot of rain forecasted again for later this week and it\u2019s going to be difficult for them to get it out, that\u2019s going to be their primary focus. So I would expect the things will continue to be slow as we go through the ordering season with their primary focus being on getting the crop out of field. ","Operator","","Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson - Credit Suisse ","","Thank you. You mentioned some modest changes for your Channel platform, targeting getting closer to the grower. Can you talk explicitly about what the margin effects are and the reasoning for the change this season? Then also going forward, just randomly, is there anything else you can do on DEKALB as well? Thanks.","Hugh Grant ","","Thanks for the question, I don\u2019t anticipate there will be any margin effect now, but Pierre maybe a little bit more color on how it shapes up between the quarter.","Pierre Courduroux","","No, really the change gives us better access to the farmer to the grower directly and that\u2019s really what we are targeting here. From accounting perspective, what we do is now we will have to recognize the revenue as the product is delivered to the farmers. In the past, we were just moving the product to our distributors and selling it to our distributors. So the change is really not material from a margin perspective, it doesn\u2019t impact the business relationship, it just shifts actually the income from Q1 and Q2 into Q3 and to give an order of magnitude you\u2019re looking at $200 million to $300 million that will be transferred from those quarters into Q3.","Christopher Parkinson - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna International Group ","","Thank you. Question, back to US corn. We hear a lot of talk of growers potentially trading down on traits. So maybe just tell me what you are seeing thus far in terms of their willingness to buy premium genetics versus their willingness to buy traits. And even if they want a trade-down on traits, is there enough single- and double-stack product out there that they could even do that?","Hugh Grant ","","Thanks for the question, good morning. I\u2019d maybe ask Brett to give a little bit, but it kind of goes back to the order book by two or three points. Number one, in the tough ag environment and it clearly is the very last thing that\u2019s traded out by the grower is the seed, so he takes a long hard look as machinery purchases, he thinks twice about what he is doing with soil nutrition, and he will even take a hard look at chemical purchases, but the last thing he compromises is on his seeds, and we\u2019ve seen this for a decade now where our best sale and our best perform in hybrids and our best technology packages are the first to sell. So we\u2019ve been conservative this year, we\u2019ve been very careful in our price cards and how we\u2019ve laid that out given the environment. I think \u201914 has been instructive, and if you look at our performance in \u201914, when you strip back Forex and you strip back shrinking acres, our performance globally, we grew or maintained share in pretty much every market around the world this year and a big piece of that was driven by performance, so headwinds in \u201915, I think we\u2019ll expect in the same (inaudible).","Pierre Courduroux ","","Yeah, as we look at \u201915 Don, I anticipate similar headwinds to what we saw with the currencies. I wouldn\u2019t say at this point we expect the same amount of deterioration and the acre base that we saw last year, but obviously it\u2019s starting out under pressure in South America, but to Hugh\u2019s point, we did really well with our price lift last year, we got the mix improvement that we were shooting for, our COGS improved and we held and grew share in the all key markets around the world.","So, as I look at this year in specific to your question around trading down on traits. The key in this Don is the biotech solution for corn rootworm is still the most compelling offer for the farmer that has a corn rootworm problem. And I simply don\u2019t see a farmer facing significant corn rootworm pressure to trade away from the biotech solutions that are available and the platform that we\u2019re selling today is very similar to what we have before, and we continue to add better and better genetics to that SmartStax platform.","You might see a few farmers on the fringe areas that don\u2019t really have a corn rootworm, but they may shift around a little bit. But those are on the margin and they\u2019re not material in that shift. I really anticipate our portfolio to look a lot like it did this year as we go into next year."," ","Don Carson","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","","Thank you. Good morning. Hugh or Brett, you guys talk about this $4 billion of incremental Seeds-and-traits growth in the next 5 years. I guess it seems pretty dramatic in the context of the prior 5 years; I think that growth rate was more like $2 billion. On slide 6 you note that in the past 5 years the industry output has been mostly about acreage lift and not yield lift. So it seems like maybe the entire industry was benefiting from those trends. And if you look forward, you're going to grow twice as fast but the acreage isn't going to grow as much. So does that imply you expect a much more dramatic market share lift or more dramatic pricing gains? Can you talk us through the components that get you that substantially higher growth rate in what arguably might be a much tougher industry context?","Hugh Grant ","Bob thanks for the question. Brett has been talking for a couple of years about the decade of the soybean and we\u2019re fast approaching the inflection point on that decade. So a big piece of this is the final coming of age of soybeans and particularly the post launch growth in Intacta in Latin America, so that\u2019s unique to Monsanto, it\u2019s a really big opportunity and if you believe there is going to be, compared for last 5 years a limited number of new acres. This is going to be the next 5 years is a bit sustainable intensification and unlocking a differential yield and I think Intacta and behind that Xtend in beans really make a big difference we see that as a bigger opportunity. You see some in \u201915 but it really flies in \u201916. Brett, I don\u2019t know if you - if maybe another word on that and some of the other growth blocks.","Brett Begemann ","I think that\u2019s exactly right and don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m absolutely thrilled with the success we had in \u201914 with Intacta in South America and I\u2019m just as excited about establishing a new metric if you\u2019ll or a new benchmark for increasing those acres this year on 10 to 12 million acres of Intacta. We\u2019ve never been able to expand that fast, but to Hugh\u2019s point \u201916 really becomes a huge inflection. But I also think it\u2019s important to keep a mind our corn business and the growth we anticipate from corn. ","As I mentioned before, we did achieve our price lift in our mix improvement and our COGS improvement and we do continue to grow our footprint and our platform around the world and with the focus becoming more on how we increase productivity on any given acre versus new acres that bodes well for us. And I\u2019m highly confident in our breeding program that continue to bring those new genetics and allow us to continue that performance and as Hugh mentioned we have the two X the rate of gain that we\u2019ve been seeing in corn just to meet the expected demand of corn around the world and I think we\u2019re very well positioned to participate in that. So that\u2019s really the fundamental driver that helps drive our corn portfolio around the world that\u2019s the other big part of that growth on top of the soybeans and then of course we can\u2019t forget the other smaller crops that we\u2019ve out there that continue to grow and then on top of that as you get towards the end of the decade the new platform start to kick in more we\u2019re investing significantly in climate, and I\u2019m thrilled with where we\u2019re in that position in the market place and we\u2019ve a head start. We\u2019re going to build on that this coming year and by the end of the decade you see that starting to contribute as well. So I do feel good about being able to accomplish that. ","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs ","Brett, as my follow-up, you gave the platform growth and the components over 4 years. If I look to what you guided to for this year, a double-digit Seeds-and-traits , given that the acreage isn't going to move much and you've got the $150 million of incremental platform growth spend, can you give us some sense of how those buckets would arrange just in the next 12 months, components of that earnings growth?","Pierre Courduroux","Bob, I mean obviously there are a lot of moving pieces and maybe going in too much detail may end up being confused. So, what I propose maybe let me lay out for you our key planning assumptions. So, when we look at our double-digit growth in Seeds-and-traits GP as we mentioned it has to come from corn and soy and that\u2019s really what we are basing ourselves on. So, in terms of assumptions; overall, we\u2019re assuming a flat global acre for those two crops and obviously there will be some minor give and take in between the two crops but as you know we were very well positioned to take advantage of that.","From a currency perspective, we\u2019re basically looking at a similar impact as what we saw this year. So, definitely where is the growth coming from, the soy opportunity I think is very clear to everybody so we\u2019ve got obviously the Intacta opportunity in South America. We\u2019ve also got a great dynamics in the U.S. markets and that\u2019s something you can see in our numbers. I mean our soy performance this year beyond Intacta has really been in the U.S. market and then we\u2019ve got the continued ramp up of our agreement with Pioneer, which is also going to impact our soybeans numbers, so soy being a key driver for growth and obviously corn.","So, specific to corn, we are definitely expecting to see the consistent mix lift that we\u2019ve enjoyed a little last few years then we know we can still count on the continued tailwinds from a cost of goods perspective I mean our planning assumptions are looking at continued tailwinds there and we are also very confident I mean based also on what we see in the market right now in our competitive position from a volume perspective. So these are the three key drivers. On top of that, we should start to see the benefits of our new platforms but it\u2019s not going to be dramatically material this year.","So, this is how we build our plan, these are the key assumptions there. And that\u2019s why we really have this confidence that we are setting up a base that\u2019s going to allow us to grow this double-digit growth in 2015 but also maybe set the base for future growth beyond \u201915.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Connelly - CLSA","Thanks. As you talk about growth, we are not hearing you talk about vegetables very much. Several years, the story with Seminis was that we were going to see an accelerated product launch process. Then we saw Europe slow down. What is the current growth view of Seminis? Has that business just not panned out the way you thought it would?","Hugh Grant ","It\u2019s been slower but I would say -- let\u2019s say Mark if you look at this last year 2014 we never talked about it much but we saw a real turnaround in the veggie business in 2014. And we look at freshness index that\u2019s kind of ironic in a vegetable business. But we look at how much of that new portfolio how much of the new breeding lines, are contributing to overall performance. And the last year or two we\u2019ve seen a nice lift there. So, the learning for us is veggies took a hard knock through the recession. You would never expect it, but consumers traded down in vegetable consumption particularly in Europe particularly in Western and Southern Europe. But we\u2019ve put a lot of energy in the executional detail and operational focus, and we\u2019ve seen a nice -- this last year 2014 we saw nice lift in that business. So I wouldn\u2019t count vegetables out.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan","Hi, good morning. In your slides you said that you think that your corn volumes will grow in 2015. You have talked about how South America is already slow; and presumably corn acres in the United States will drop, I don't know, 5%, something like that. So in the scheme of things, can you explain why corn volumes should grow in 2015? How might volume in Eastern Europe or in some other geography offset the pressure that is in your two key geographies?","Hugh Grant ","Jeff thanks for the question. I\u2019ll maybe pass a piece of this to Pierre, but our assumptions are on acres, who knows we\u2019re sitting here in the fall and we don\u2019t have the crop harvested yet but our plan and our operating assumptions are that acres will be about flat with last year. So in the U.S. we said all the way through last year we would be happy if the crop had 9 on front if there is 90 something it looks as if it probably had an 8 in front of it. And as we go into next year plus or minus I think acres will be about the same. The Latin American markets are still playing out in front of us but there is no doubt that acres are going to be down the question is how much. And a lot of that is just them watching U.S. harvest. And I think a fair operating assumption is it\u2019s going to be flattish down there as well. ","But as Brett mentioned and has points we\u2019ve seen either share maintenance or share growth in every one of our key markets around the world, so we will see some volume growth based on that.","Pierre Courduroux ","I think the other thing, Jeff, I\u2019d just add to that. I think as you look at Eastern Europe, we continue to see the expansion of that marketplace to higher performing genetics and that bodes well for us as we\u2019re extremely well positioned over there, so you get good volume growth in an environment like that, that helps offset some of things that we observe that\u2019s going on in Latin America, and as Hugh said, it\u2019s still hard to call right now and what acres are going to do. I would tell you though I remind you that as we look at the macro-environment that\u2019s out there. Ethanol plants are running as hard as they\u2019ve ever run; we\u2019re seeing the animal feeding industry picking back up and I think this big pile of corn that we\u2019re facing with, with the global demand continuing to grow I think that\u2019s going to deteriorate. And most importantly for me as I look at it and the trade-offs that I look at is I can\u2019t say here today and tell you what the acreage are going to be, but I can tell you that nobody has the soybean platform that Monsanto has, and then South America as soybeans start trading into replace corn, we\u2019re extremely well positioned to participate in that. And if that occurs in the U.S. most likely if corn acres slowdown they\u2019re most likely going to go to soybeans and we\u2019re well positioned to participate in that, so I believe that that portfolio balance is really important for us and that will play out over the year.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","And for my follow-up to your corn seeds volumes grow in 2014 globally?","Pierre Courduroux ","No, if you look at this past year, we\u2019ve delivered on all the metrics that we were looking at as I have mentioned that couple of times, the significant reduction in corn acres in particularly in the Americas really put the damper on corn growths, so we were slightly down to flattish on the overall corn volume. But the things that we were following really drove our performance in corn it was just simply the acres.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay. ","Pierre Courduroux ","As I have mentioned, I am not expecting the same level of deterioration for next year as we saw this year.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","I hope you\u2019re right. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with you question.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. On the same subject, the US corn share, was it flat this year? Was it up modestly, given the big decline in corn acres? What do you think happened to your US corn share? ","Brett Begemann","","Good morning David, this is Brett. We\u2019re setting here harvest time and this is always the frustrating time because we still don\u2019t know what the actual planted acres are going to be in the U.S. And as Hugh mentioned, we believe they probably have an aid in front of and that will sort itself out overtime. Here is what I can tell you, from looking at our branded business and our license business there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that our genetic platform in the U.S. grew and that will sort itself out across the various brands, but I feel really good about how we performed in the U.S. corn business this year.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Very good and Brett just on for \u201915, so your corn seed gross profit margins increased at the same rates last year, or higher, or lower?","Brett Begemann","So I would expect the margin to increase as we\u2019ve been saying and about the same to slightly lower.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Very good, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","Yes, hi. Good morning. You are talking about shifting the supply chain going directly to farmers can you tell us what percentage of your sales are direct to farmers today? And where do you see that going in the future?","Hugh Grant ","So, P.J. this is not going direct to farmers and maybe we didn\u2019t articulate it right. I mean the way we used our Channel brand and our Channel seedsmen in the countryside is basically an average channel of distribution that we\u2019re using and I mean the size of that business, I don\u2019t think we ever really disclosed the size of that business. I mean it\u2019s definitely part of our brand share and an important part of our brand share, but we have not disclosed the breakdown in between the brands. What we know is this definitely an area of that we\u2019ve seen growth in and that we feel very good about.","Brett Begemann ","I think the couple of hundred million would be -- if you think about P.J. and trying to scale it amongst everything else to Pierre\u2019s point when you see the shift in the third quarter it\u2019s a couple of hundred million dollars. So we gained good insights that\u2019s a really important leg of the stool but that\u2019s what -- it\u2019s a leg of the stool. So between the Channel business moving where the revenue recognition that\u2019s associated with it and a lot of our third party suppliers in that business now being translated directly in a brand that\u2019s why we took the extra time this morning and explained some of those shifts. As frustrating as they are, I think they\u2019re both really good moves for the business long-term.","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","Thank you and then can you quantify the benefit you saw from the lower corn and soybean prices in 2014? And what is your expectation compared to that in 2015?","Hugh Grant ","Do you mean the lower COGS?","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","Lower COGS, yes.","Hugh Grant ","Pierre, maybe a quick word on because we did some benefit in that.","Pierre Courduroux","Yes, we did see some benefits there and in our margin improvements in our seeds-and-traits parts half to two thirds of it was coming from COGS.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. I guess a couple questions on glyphosate, if I may. First, would you elaborate on what is causing the timing shift from 1Q into 2Q? And then related to that, I would normally think as you move and shift the mix from nonbranded to branded that that would help your profitability. But the overall year looks down 10% or so as per your guidance. So perhaps you could help us reconcile that.","Hugh Grant ","Take the first piece; and Brett, maybe you can cover the second piece. We had some customers who -- it\u2019s an industrial supply of third party business, who have indicated that they will be stepping back or throttling back from that. So we\u2019ve been moving successfully, we\u2019ve been moving third party supply, to your point, Kevin, into higher margin branded business. And as that occurs, we see that business moving closer to market applications. So in a world where we make and sell 300 million gallons, every gallon that you can sell with Roundup brand on it is marginally better news. So that\u2019s the timing shift and then Brett, the margin effect that the slowdown of the 10% slight in the business.","Brett Begemann","Yes, good morning Kevin. So as we look at the overall Ag productivity segment specifically Roundup, I feel like we had a really strong performance here in \u201914 as reflected in the final results and all I\u2019m saying is I\u2019m not anticipating that kind of strength through the entire \u201915 and that\u2019s why we try to range-bound it in the range down maybe 10% or so on the Roundup business or Ag productivity that but it\u2019s really just about looking at how we expect to be positioned in the market and what we see from the competitive generic products in the market.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Bryan Hurley","Jesse, this is Bryan, I think we probably have time for two more questions so that we leave just a little bit of time for Mr. Grant to wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you, our next question will come from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Thank you. Just looking at Intacta in Brazil, on the part of the payment for Intacta on the back end, could you maybe provide some color on how it is going for you, getting paid and collecting payment on the back end? Thanks.","Hugh Grant","","Yes, I mean good early progress because we\u2019re in the front end of the launch process we\u2019re selling a lot more seeds than we\u2019re collecting at the grain elevator. So in many ways this is a bit easier at the start. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think there is a couple of really important points and I think it\u2019s important to not forget before Intacta was launched we had already reached the point we\u2019re about 80% of the soybeans planted in Brazil were from newly purchased seed. So you combine that together with the fact that Intacta is in its early days the primary source of seed for Intacta is newly purchased seed. With where the market already was we feel really good about our \u201915 opportunity for Intacta and we\u2019re in really good place, I look at the point of deliver system that we have in place with the grain handlers is really a backstop as we try to move that market to newly purchased high value seed and we have that very much in place going into next year so we feel good about it.","Operator","Thank you, our final question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS ","Thank you. The $150 million spend on new platforms. I assume that is just precision agriculture and biologicals. Is that an increase year-over-year, or is that an absolute number? ","Hugh Grant ","The absolute number is in the range of 360 million, the 150 is the increase year-to-year.","John Roberts - UBS ","And it is largely just precision Ag and biologicals that you are - ","Hugh Grant ","That\u2019s correct.","John Roberts - UBS ","(Multiple speakers) for next year as well, or we plateau here at this level? ","Hugh Grant ","We\u2019ll still see growth most likely note the same extent of growth obviously because this year is a significant investment we\u2019re making but we\u2019ll continue to invest in both platforms as we go.","John Roberts - UBS ","Thank you.","Hugh Grant ","Thank you John, we brought forward some of that investment and I think that\u2019s a piece of the uniqueness in the company and a tough year for the Ag economy we see the opportunity to grow the base and simultaneously as we\u2019re growing that base make this significant investment these two new platforms and use that to widen the gap versus as in our competition. So we\u2019re going to do those two things simultaneously this year. So, let me wrap up I would like on behalf of the team here in St. Louis I would like to thank you again for joining us on the call this morning. As always, this is an important call for us as we lay our plans and our expectations for what we see as the next milestone. And that ties to John Roberts question; it\u2019s the next milestone in a five year growth runway. ","So let me just wrap up this morning by emphasizing two points. Firstly, it begins in 2015, this is a year for us where we believe that we\u2019re in a unique position to deliver strong growth today at the same time that we step up our spending to unlock transformational long-term growth. And secondly, 2015 is really a springboard and is opportunity that we see over the next five years we don\u2019t see this as backend loaded we see really nice growth through the \u201816 to \u201819 timeframe this starts in 2015 and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been targeting at least doubling our ongoing EPS over that time frame. So we\u2019ve a clear objective, the opportunity is real and with the drivers in place and in hand. So we\u2019re focused on delivering the opportunity and we look forward to sharing our progress against those milestones with you. So thanks very much for joining us again this morning.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

W3elcome to the first quarter 2014 Monsanto Company earnings and R&D update conference call. [Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, investor relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you Mr. Hurley, you may begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, operator, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings update. I\u2019m joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our president and chief operating officer; as well as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; and Rob Fraley, our chief technology officer. And also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Tim Baker, and Manny Cruz","As it has been historically, our first quarter call is the first data point on our business for the year, as well as an extensive review of our R&D pipeline. So our emphasis today will be on the color in both categories. ","The call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and supporting slides, and replay, at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP and an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which on the website. ","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.","We\u2019ll move quickly to the heart of our strategic discussion. As we do, let me anchor it on a brief point of our first quarter results on slide four in the financial section of the slides. Our first quarter EPS was $0.67, which was ahead of last year\u2019s Q1, and reflects the first increment of growth, in line with our expectation, as we outlined our full year outlook and earnings flow at the beginning of the year.","Likewise, our free cash flow for the quarter was $457 million, which includes the expected investment in the Climate Corporation acquisition and incremental capex that are built into our full year guidance. Combined, both measures reinforce confidence in our full year outlook.","So with that, let me hand it to Hugh for the strategic view of this first quarter. ","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, and happy new year to everybody on the line. The first quarter is an important milestone, as it sets the tone for the year, so I think what\u2019s important about this first quarter is, on the key measures, we\u2019re exactly where we expected to be. ","Even at this early point, that\u2019s the validation that our business is delivering on our expectations. We have the right growth strategy in place and fiscal year \u201914 is off to the right start. Brett and Pierre will walk through the specific details, but let me set out the key points that I feel for Q1 and the strategic context of both fiscal year \u201914 and also our multiyear growth outlook.","First, with everything on track, we\u2019re confirming our full year guidance today, as shown on slide five. All of our indicators continue to line up to deliver a projected mid to high teens operational growth and bottom line ongoing EPS guidance. That\u2019s no small point, particularly in a year where there\u2019s more volatility and more headwinds across agriculture than there has been in the past few years.","Secondly, while Q1 isn\u2019t a big quarter in terms of dollars, it\u2019s a quarter that featured several key milestones that reinforce this year\u2019s outlook and our midterm growth, ranging from the strength of the order book and strong prepays to the visibility of our 3 million acre launch of Intacta in South America.","It is still early, and with the end of the Latin America second season and the full northern hemisphere season ahead, so while our early indicators are right on track, we\u2019re going to stay focused on delivering in each of those seasons before we declare success.","I\u2019d also highlight that we have another key milestone, our second quarter in a row with record use of cash for share repurchases. We\u2019ve now bought more than $1.1 billion in shares over the last two quarters, as we\u2019ve moved from addressing dilution to meaningfully reducing share count.","As we look ahead from the first quarter, we\u2019re now in the period where there\u2019s always a lot of speculation about acres and shifts, so it\u2019s a year where our balanced portfolio is a real benefit. Commodities and acres are shifting this year, more than the last few, but our balance provides hedges in different crops, products, and geographies that balance those year-to-year ups and downs.","Maybe more importantly, the broad opportunity in agriculture on slide six creates a long runway outside of the shifts in any one year. The simple reality is that demand continues to grow, and even at conservative rates that don\u2019t yet factor further demand with lower commodity prices, there\u2019s a long horizon of opportunity ahead for companies like Monsanto that can leverage technology to help farmers meet this demand in new ways.","And that\u2019s my final point. This quarter always reflects our annual update on our R&D pipeline. It\u2019s the innovation in this pipeline that\u2019s going to continue our leadership in driving yield and productivity to serve that demand. ","It\u2019s leadership that\u2019s reflected in the fact that we have a record number of advancements in the pipeline this year. But it\u2019s also leadership in defining what\u2019s next for this industry. With the new platforms, we\u2019re ramping up in precision agriculture and biologicals. We have more technology and more platforms to drive that next increment of yield and productivity than ever before.","So with that, let me hand it over to Brett to add some color to these key milestones.","Brett Begemann","Thanks, Hugh, and happy new year to everyone on the line. Hugh noted that our business results came in right as expected, an early indicator that we\u2019re on track to deliver the growth we expect in 2014. At an operational level, I\u2019d take that one step further. In the first quarter, the visibility has improved across the board on our key growth drivers shown on slide seven.","As we entered the year, I said my emphasis would be on margin expansion. We\u2019re seeing the pricing uplift as we upgrade the portfolio, the mix lift with technology upgrades, contributions from our global business, and the benefit of an improved cost of goods position. And with one quarter of results in hand, margins in both corn and soybeans are showing the first increment of improvement we expected. ","Let me make that practical, as I focus on the metrics that matter. The biggest of those is one of the most important metrics at this time of year, the U.S. order book, on slide eight. We\u2019re coming off several strong years for the U.S. business, and we\u2019re in a good position to continue that again in 2014. At the end of the calendar year, the order pace for the U.S. portfolio is strong, and tracking very well with our growth targets.","That\u2019s particularly important given that farmers are ordering against a lower expected planet acre base than would have driven the intensions for corn last year at this time. U.S. customer prepays are up over last year, and provide a good indicator that there are solid commitments behind the order book. The deadlines for prepayment and cancellations were in December, and with those behind us, we now have strong clarity on our position ahead of our primary shipment season. ","That\u2019s also reflected in the quality of the order book, where we see the mix uplift we expected that backs our plans. In corn, we\u2019re on track with the germplasm portfolio upgrades that drive the 5% to 10% price mix uplift. Likewise, in soybeans we see order book strength, which is relevant in a year where we see some shifting in acres between crops. The order book is a good indicator, but we\u2019ll stay focused until the business proves out. At this point in the year, I feel as good as I can about the order pace, mix, and growth opportunity. ","The order book is also a reflection of the strong wrap-up of the U.S. harvest for our products, and that\u2019s part of the improved line of sight I mentioned. It provides another year of strong product yield performance that Rob will highlight. As our teams work with our grower customers, that\u2019s a critical component that reinforces our performance advantage year-in and year-out.","The other key post-harvest milestone is the better visibility on the cost of goods improvement we expected. With the production in full swing, we\u2019ve seen the benefit begin to flow through and that underscores our confidence in our cost position and margin improvement.","The next critical drivers take us to Latin America, and specifically the Intacta opportunity on slide nine. With most of the South America soybean acres planted, we\u2019ve achieved a major milestone. We have very good visibility into the success our largest-ever soybean launch, with an expected 3 million acres of Intacta. Practically, we\u2019ve been very focused on making sure farmers have a good experience, as the record pace this year starts a slingshot for what we expect is a faster ramp up than any previous soybean launch.","This is a year where some heavy insect pressure actually showcases the benefits of Intacta more visibly. Across Brazil, there are common reports of growers already spraying normal soybean fields four to five times to deal with heavy pressure. ","When you can reduce two to three sprays with Intacta, it speaks to the direct value and savings that gets combined with the improved yield. Our South American teams are working closely with growers, our channel partners, and across our brands, to bulk up the right varieties in the marketplace to enable a quick ramp up in both Brazil and Argentina against the 100 million acres of opportunity. ","Moving to corn, despite the fact that there were less planted summer acres in Brazil and Argentina, we are still seeing the trade upgrade that\u2019s critical to our longer term growth. Those upgrades are happening consistently, as next-generation traits are expected to represent around 50% and 60% of our trait mix in our brands in Brazil and Argentina, respectively.","In the larger portfolio, our ag productivity business is on track, with the stable to stronger outlook we provided, and we are benefitting from our consistent and disciplined pricing approach. Effectively, we are seeing the contribution from the price accumulation that occurred in 2013 as we compare back to the first quarter of last year. ","As we move forward, we expect this to normalize and have not built our plans around price increases, but rather to a flat to potentially declining generic price. Specifically, in places like the U.S. and Brazil, where indicators point to a significant number of soybean acres planted, and growers are looking for solutions to manage tough to control weeds, we expect demand for glyphosate to stay strong over the coming year and to further drive our mix toward our branded products. And today, that branded mix is already at some of the highest levels we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. ","And finally, let me emphasize on that doesn\u2019t drive the financials this year, but sets much of the opportunity ahead, and that\u2019s our precision ag platform on slide 10. 2014 will be a year of strategic milestones, and we\u2019ve already had several major advancements since our November investor day.","First, we recognize we want to turn our early head start into a major long term advantage, and you do that by building your organization for speed. We\u2019ve formally united Integrated Farming Systems, Precision Planting, and the Climate Corporation teams into a focused, operating group. It is being led by David Friedberg, the Climate Corporation CEO, and will report directly to me.","This is a business structure that will drive the natural connections between these technologies and will have the autonomy and flexibility to optimize the dollars we\u2019re investing in the platform and deploy technology at a software industry pace. The biggest priority for Dave\u2019s team will be the commercial launches of FieldScripts, Climate Basic, Climate Pro, and multiple precision planting upgrades, in addition to expanding Climate\u2019s risk management operations.","Just as we\u2019ve looked at the order book for our seed business earlier, you can project a similar outlook for these products and services, and I\u2019d tell you we\u2019re making good progress against our targets, and we expect a strong first year base of subscription acres across our precision ag family of offerings.","The second critical priority in building the platform is to get anchor partnerships in 2014, and I\u2019m pleased to announce today that we\u2019ve entered into a memo of understanding with Winfield, our largest distribution partner and the largest U.S. agricultural retail distributor. We\u2019ve agreed to work together to explore formal connections between our IFS and Climate Corporation tools in conjunction with their industry leading R7 precision ag offering. This is a giant first step, and we see this as a catalyst to accelerate the formation of an industry-wide information and decision tool platform. ","So with that, let me hand it over to Pierre. ","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Brett outlined the significant milestones that reinforce our confidence in the business and underscore the growth opportunity for this fiscal year. I will now highlight a couple of points related to how I see this year\u2019s financial outlook at the end of Q1.","First, as Hugh indicated, the financials for the quarter are right on track with what we expected, and although Q1 reflects less than 15% of our full year earnings, it reinforces our confidence in our full year projections and our ability to deliver on our commitments.","Second, over the last year, I have indicated that we would be more aggressive in taking action on our cash deployment, and in this quarter, we\u2019ve been true to that priority. We\u2019ve reflected our confidence in growth within the business through additional capex investments, we\u2019ve invested in additional growth through the additions of the Climate Corporation and our alliance with Novozymes, and we\u2019ve been deliberate in being more aggressive in returning value to our owners, as we\u2019ve just completed our second quarter of record spending on share buybacks, which contributed to lowering the share count versus the first quarter of last year by about 8 million shares.","I\u2019ll cover this cash deployment emphasis in more detail, but before I do so, let me briefly cover a couple of key points in the quarter and how they tie to our full year growth metrics, on slide 11. The most relevant financial milestone in the quarter is the incremental margin improvement we start to see in both corn and soybeans. ","Importantly, we\u2019re seeing the first steps toward the expected full year margin improvement, and we are squarely on track for a growth of around 3 points in corn and 6 to 8 points in soybeans. This is important, because this reinforces our confidence in our expected seeds and genomics gross profit growth for the full year.","In a small quarter, the bottom line performance reflects some of the anticipated changes from last year\u2019s Q1, and all of the financials line up well with how we see the business playing out for the full year. As expected, a majority of the quarterly contribution came from our seeds and genomics segment. ","The biggest factor there is the most strategic, the positive margin contribution coming from the trait and mix upgrades in corn and soybeans. This positive driver is balanced against the expected decreases in corn acres in Latin America, some acre and timing effects related to cotton in Australia, and a more normalized U.S. contribution pattern after the step up from last year\u2019s accelerated season.","The first quarter also reflects the Roundup contribution Brett mentioned, as we saw the anticipated carryover benefit from last year\u2019s pricing and some early volumes. For the rest of the year, we expect that to normalize to the steady to better view we now have on ag productivity.","Regarding operating expenses, we did see a quarterly increase coming from our early launches. In particular, some of the launches related to precision agriculture and Intacta required some early investments. While operating expenses will grow this year, we expect to continue with our disciplined approach to spending those investments, as we achieve milestones like launches and approvals.","As I think about the earnings flow from here, on slide 12, it\u2019s helpful to work backwards from Q4. As we expect to see the positive contribution from soybeans royalties in both Brazil and the U.S. and don\u2019t anticipate to see a repeat of some of the isolated factors that impacted Q4 in FY13, we expect the fourth quarter to be significantly less of a loss this year. ","We expect Q2 to be the largest earnings quarter and contributing to growth, but with a more normalized U.S. season and some of the ag productivity timing benefits in the first quarter, we don\u2019t expect to see the same magnitude of Q2 growth as we saw with last year\u2019s accelerated U.S. season. Through the coming quarters, we expect to make incremental progress on our margin and EBITDA growth targets, with the full effect realized by the close of Q4. ","From there, I want to focus on our cash generation and deployments on slide 13. In the quarter, we generated $457 million in free cash, reflecting strong prepays and the investment in the Climate Corporation. This keeps us on track for a full year free cash guidance of $600 million to $800 million. And to be clear, this guidance is inclusive of the $932 million purchase price already applied to the acquisition and the $300 million related to the recently announced Novozymes deal.","Over the last year, I\u2019ve reinforced our commitment to use that cash generation to fund growth and continue to be aggressive in returning more of the value created to our owners. Within the quarter, we completed a $1 billion public debt offering, taking advantage of the favorable debt market and our strong balance sheet, largely to fund the acquisition of the Climate Corporation.","I think this demonstrates that we are willing to use the strength of our balance sheet to fund all the priority items we\u2019ve called out, including our capex, share buybacks, and dividend programs. We\u2019ve continued to fund organic growth, as demonstrated by the $300 million capex investment in the quarter. We\u2019ve also continued to fund future growth as highlighted by the Climate Corporation acquisition, but also by the investments we\u2019ve made in the alliance with Novozymes. ","And we have continued to fund our share buyback program and for the second straight quarter we have set a record for buyback spending, with $561 million in Q1. Combined, we have repurchased approximately $1.1 billion over the last two quarters. ","We closed out our previous share buyback authorization in just seven months, and are already making significant progress against the $2 billion program announced last June. That aggressive program is already showing fruit in the financials, as we\u2019ve made a significant transition from only offsetting dilution to reducing share count. ","We began this year with a lower share count than the same time last year, and we again expect to further reduce on a full year basis, ahead of planned \u201915. And finally, we also stayed committed to funding our dividend program, as demonstrated by the increase in our annual dividend at the end of our fiscal year.","So, as I wrap up, let me emphasize that we are confident in our earnings growth for this year, and that we are focused on using the strong cash-generating capability of our business to continue that growth, while also being aggressive in delivering value to our owners. ","With that, I will hand it off to Rob to talk about the continued opportunity created by our pipeline. ","Rob Fraley","Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everybody on the line. I\u2019m going to jump right into the pipeline update, starting with slide four, and here\u2019s the headlines. First, I think this is more than just a record year in terms of project advancements. It\u2019s an exponential step change in the pace and breadth of our R&D engine.","We\u2019ve expanded the number of projects and platforms as we capitalize on the only pipeline in the industry that truly targets a total system for yield and productivity. On slides five through eight, you can see we have more than 70 projects in the pipeline, and we advanced almost 30 of those this year. This sets a new trend, and with the expansion of the pipeline and the opportunity with some fast cycle technology, I think we\u2019ve moved from the days of advancing a dozen or so projects to advancing waves in our new platforms each year.","Second, that\u2019s important, because it sets the commercial opportunity. In this year, you\u2019ll see a record number of projects graduating from the pipeline. You\u2019ve heard me say we don\u2019t do science for the sake of science. Our focus is on getting products to the commercial marketplace so they can help our farmer customers, and this is the proof point. There\u2019s five products coming online this year, including game-changing technologies like Intacta and FieldScripts.","And that leads me to my final highlight. Among these advancements, some of the most exciting advances are coming from our new platforms. It\u2019s not just that we have new platforms, but that these platforms build on the established lead we already have in breeding and biotech. That\u2019s a tremendous competitive advantage, and we\u2019re really entering a new era where we expect farmers will see waves of technology that build on each other in a total system, in the seed, in the bag, and in the field.","Given the number of advancements, I won\u2019t go project by project. So I\u2019ll highlight across key themes, starting with the strategic link we\u2019ve made this year with our new platforms. We\u2019ve added or advanced more than 10 projects in precision ag and biologicals, including several first-ever product launches. ","The most powerful near-term catapult will come from the integrated farming systems pipeline, on slide nine, and there\u2019s been big progress since our November investor event. Most importantly, the cross synergy we expected between the Climate Corporation and FieldScripts is already proving out. ","With the first version of FieldScripts barely out of the pipeline, we are already working on the enhanced version that increases the power of FieldScripts by building in the hyper-local weather modeling capability from climate. From there, we\u2019re adding on even more layers, as we\u2019re working on prescriptions for varying nutrition and other inputs, and then positioning multiple corn hybrids and soybean varieties per field. ","Likewise, the Climate Corporation team is supercharging their algorithms with the massive genetic database from Monsanto\u2019s field testing, differentiating decision tools like Climate Pro with the scope and scale of data that we believe is unrivaled. ","The pipeline is analogous to software upgrades in terms of timing and frequency, with rapid upgrade cycles adding features and functionality that help drive initial adoption and continuing added value. This is exciting work, and I\u2019m thrilled with what we\u2019ve been able to assemble, and the progress we\u2019ve made in this area in such a short time.","Practically, our Ground Breakers program this past season was among the most successful and insightful that we\u2019ve had, as it allowed us not only to test multiple types of prescriptions, but also the equipment and the delivery system. ","Growers are more interested in this precision agriculture opportunity than I\u2019ve seen with almost any other new technology, so as we make the early transition to the commercial arena this year, the first couple hundred thousand acres are strategically important, but they\u2019re not material financially, as we start the ramp up with the early adopters for our precision ag family, for what we see as a transformational platform over the next few years.","We\u2019ve made just as important strides in the area of biologicals, with the springboard year for both our BioDirect application and new microbials in our alliance with Novozymes. Our first topical BioDirect RNAi technology appeared in the pipeline only two years ago, and today, on slide 10, we\u2019ve made advancements across multiple projects in insect, in disease control, and even bee health.","These projects are now in phase one, so there\u2019s still work to do, but as you can see by the data and the photos on the slide, the results are extremely exciting, and so we\u2019ll continue the development work as this is definitely a breakthrough technology that could create significant value in the next decade.","Our biologicals platform was accelerated with our recently announced bio-ag alliance with Novozymes. This is the premier microbial R&D engine in the industry, and while I hinted at it when we announced the alliance, we now have new research data that proves our testing capability can result in game-changing products.","On slide 11, this year we saw the early power of our testing network. In only first-year testing, but these early results are directional, however the data is very encouraging. In corn, we saw an average yield benefit of 4 to 6 bushels per acre, with key products that will be part of the alliance, marking a level of performance that compares with some of the most successful biotech traits.","Now, we\u2019ll expand the field testing power with plans for an unprecedented 1 million yield plots over the next few years. Just as importantly, in this year\u2019s research we saw encouraging results that tell us that there are variable reactions to microbial performance in different agronomic conditions. We believe there is a tremendous synergy between our microbial and precision ag platforms, where we can optimize the placement, performance, and realized benefit of microbial products.","Not to be lost is another key point that applies to both BioDirect and microbials. These are a different class of product than GMOs, and we expect many to have expedited regulatory approvals, lower cost development, and the ability to benefit markets where biotech traits aren\u2019t relevant today.","If we shift to the next theme, it\u2019s around breakthrough areas where Monsanto is developing technology that departs from anything anyone else in the industry has done. The best example of this is our corn rootworm 3 technology on slide 12, where we\u2019ve developed the first insect-controlled product to use RNAi based modes of action inside the plant. So while the rest of the industry still focuses exclusively on BT genes, we have a completely novel approach.","The lead project advanced again this year to our precommercial testing in phase four, marking rapid progress through the development phases and setting us up for regulatory review, as we\u2019ve submitted in the U.S. and in several international markets.","With that milestone, we\u2019re transitioning from a project to a product that will be branded as Smartstax Pro. That keeps us on the right path for the next commercial upgrade of our Smartstax platform later this decade.","Just as importantly, last year we advanced the next generation of RNAi candidates, so we have a wave of unique modes of action coming to upgrade, solidify our durability, and to add incremental value for farmers.","Another technology unique to our R&D effort is the work we\u2019re doing in yield and stress with the BASF collaboration. And today there are two pieces of new news. First, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we\u2019ve extended the yield and stress research and development collaboration with BASF, allowing us to continue this valuable partnership as we target new yield opportunities for farmers.","On the performance side, last year we mentioned that we were seeing early but promising signs in corn taking a multi-gene approach to increasing yield. On slide 13, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve made some important progress this year as we\u2019ve identified a new wave of promising gene candidates that gives us a pool of yield-enhancing options to test. ","This is obviously early, but we see this ability to identify multiple yield genes as one of the differentiators in our BASF collaboration, and critical to being able to really address yield and stress on a broad scale.","As we move on, one thing that stands out in our pipeline is our depth. Others in the industry are still pursuing first and second generation products, while we\u2019re generally focused on third and fourth generation upgrades with broad acre global potential. And the case study is clearly our weed and insect control programs, where we\u2019ve made several advancements this year.","The biggest, of course, is Intacta, on slide 14. This blockbuster moves out of the pipeline as it enters the commercial market, but scientifically the step change is in the rapid deployment of next generation upgrades. In the U.S., a decade passed between first and second generation technologies. With Intacta, we just advanced our second generation to phase 4 in the same year we launched the first generation version. And look no further than this year to see why this matters.","As Brett said, with the significant outbreak of insect pressure, the better performance of Intacta is very visible. With that insect pressure so top of mind, next generation products that expand insect control and enhance durability really matter to growers, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s in our pipeline.","The next obvious example is weed control, where the Roundup Ready 2 Yield extend crop system starts a similar upgrade cycle for third and fourth generations. Both the biotech trait and the complementary chemistry are in phase four, with some of the new progress focused on our chemistry formulation we announced called XtendiMax with VaporGrip. And that\u2019s designed to significantly reduce volatility while providing excellent weed control and residual activity.","With the increasing need for multiple modes of action in weed control, this product will be able to serve a large addressable market, with a fit on over 100 million acres across the Americas. We\u2019re progressing towards commercial launch in both the U.S. and internationally. The recent Dicamba chemistry [over the top] label approval in Canada reflects a significant milestone of the first complete Xtend system approval of trait and chemistry.","We continue to see progress on approvals in the U.S., Argentina, and other key import markets. The recent announcement of progress on the Dow Enlist environmental impact statement provides us further encouragement that these product approvals are progressing on track in the USDA.","And we\u2019re not stopping here. On slide 15, we\u2019ve added two new third and fourth generation projects this year, both focused on building on our Xtend platform by incorporating additional modes of action for weed control.","The last theme I\u2019d like to emphasize is our breeding engine, which I often describe as our biggest blockbuster. And it matters for two reasons. First, it provides the horsepower, as we upgrade our global germplasm portfolio every year, and most people appreciate that. But lesser appreciated is the power in breeding technology to target problems plant breeders simply couldn\u2019t tackle five years ago.","And our disease resistance program is the perfect example. With the tools of high throughput screening and advanced markers, we\u2019re able to supercharge our efforts here and that acceleration is evident this year. ","On slide 16, we deployed this resistance capability in row crops, with four major advancements that target some of the most devastating diseases in corn, soybeans, and cotton. And likewise, we\u2019ve leveraged those same tools in vegetables, and you can see on slide 17 that we\u2019ve added two completely new projects and advanced another key project in our focused crops. ","And as I complete the run of the technology platforms, I can\u2019t stress enough the differential advantage we get because of our breeding engine across crops. Now, we did an extensive review of our data at our November event, but I have one significant new update to highlight today. ","On slide 18, you can see our cotton results for this year, where the new cotton varieties we\u2019re launching are delivering a similar step change in performance to what we\u2019re seeing in corn. We\u2019re outyielding the competitive best by 6%. And that\u2019s about 74 pounds of cotton lint per acre, or nearly a $60 an acre advantage for Delta Pine cotton.","On slide 19, you\u2019ll also see that we\u2019ve now put back to back years together with a better than four bushel per acre advantage of Roundup Ready 2 Yield over the first generation product. ","But the highlight for me continues to be our corn advantage, on slide 20. With our final results, our yield advantage is eight bushels an acre, and so even in a year where overall yields were some of the strongest we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re still in that 7 to 10 bushel an acre advantage band. And it\u2019s that consistency and performance that defines our DEKALB products and really forms the base of technology and performance across all of our products.","And that, I think, is an absolutely critical point, on slide 21. There\u2019s always a lot of talk about new technologies or products, but everything we do is built on the best-performing seed in the industry. And increasingly it means that the more we pair our germplasm advantage with technology in the seed, in the bag, and in the field, the bigger our competitive advantage can become.","While our R&D leadership is key, it\u2019s more than just the fact that we have a record number of advancements. The pipeline itself paints a compelling picture of where this industry is going. Increasingly, we\u2019re moving beyond farmers making due with disconnected input components, and we\u2019re on the leading edge of giving farmers real, integrated systems in their fields.","Think about it, you start with the seed that\u2019s capable of delivering more yield than at any other point in history. And then we protect that with cutting edge traits embedded in the seeds. Wrap around that chemical and microbial seed treatments that fend off disease and increase the health of the plant. And then utilize sophisticated algorithms to plant and position all the inputs, meter by meter, across the field.","We\u2019re talking about a prescription agriculture that looks a lot like individually personalized medicine, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to drive yield and productivity, and you can see all the elements coming together in waves that build on each other, and which drive the opportunity for our farmer customers and our company.","So thanks, and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bryan for the Q&A. ","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Rob. And with the extended conference call to accommodate the R&D update, we\u2019ve planned for some additional time for questions as well. With that, we\u2019d like to open the call for questions now, and as we typically do, I\u2019ll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so we can take as many questions from people as possible. You\u2019re always welcome to rejoin the queue for a followup. So, operator, I think we\u2019re ready to take questions from the line. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley ","I just want to try to square some of your qualitative comments about the order book and where the year sits with what we saw in the quarter, as well as where your deferred revenue is. And I guess in particular, what I\u2019m trying to understand is how the deferred revenue wound up being flat year over year. And the simple math that I\u2019m doing is that we see corn acres down in Brazil, it looks like they\u2019ll probably be down in the U.S., and so I\u2019m assuming that means your overall volume will be down. And if volume\u2019s down, I kind of think that means price mix must be up to keep deferred revenue flat. Is that too simple of a calculation? Or are there other moving parts?","Hugh Grant ","Maybe I\u2019ll let Pierre give a little bit more color on that, because there is a bit of algebra and geometry playing there. But I think the headline in this is we feel good about where our order book is.","Pierre Courduroux ","Regarding the deferred revenue and the prepays and the order book, which all go together, we really feel we\u2019re in a very good situation. And maybe what you missed in the criteria you listed is that remember last year\u2019s season was extremely early. So actually with all the discussions around the acres that are going on right now, the fact that the season last year was way earlier, and farmers were trying to secure supply, actually being at the same level of prepays as we were - actually we\u2019re a little up - versus last year, we feel is really a vote of confidence from the growers. So it\u2019s still very early, but we feel actually very good about the situation regarding our prepays and deferred revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs ","I appreciate the comments around the order book. Just sort of following onto that last question, just qualitatively it seemed like you indicated the mix was improving. That seemed maybe a little bit counter to what some might have thought with corn prices falling here. So I was just looking to see if there are any trends below the surface you\u2019re seeing to indicate that farmers might be either trading down on the type of seed that they\u2019re buying or that you\u2019re seeing any increased competitiveness when it comes to pricing or discounting going on right now.","Hugh Grant ","I think the danger is we always default to corn and the love affair with corn, and soy sometimes gets neglected. And I think Brett, you started this by talking about margin upgrades, and we\u2019ve seen that in both corn and in soy, or the front end of that in corn and soy. Maybe just a word on mix and volume, how you\u2019re feeling about that?","Brett Begemann ","I think that\u2019s a really important part of this. We started the year with a focus on margin, and that margin improvement comes from continued movement to second generation traits in South America, which albeit acres are down, but we clearly see our second generation traits moving up in our portfolio. ","So I see famers stepping up, not stepping backwards. We see the strength in our portfolio, whether stepping forwards to our new germplasms, our new hybrids and varieties. And when I look at the U.S., I feel really good about the mix that we see in our early order book. As I look across, the farmers are not stepping back. They\u2019re actually stepping up to the better performing products in the order book. So that\u2019s why I feel so good about it right now.","From a competitive standpoint, to your point in the market, we\u2019re back to a normal year, and there\u2019s normal noise in the marketplace, but I don\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary or what we would expect. The focus for us is we\u2019ve got the best germplasm and performing products, the best trait packages, and we\u2019ll stay focused on that.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs ","And just a follow up, if I could, on Intacta. Just the difference between Intacta and the second generation of it. As Brett mentioned, we\u2019re seeing a lot of pest pressure in Latin America in soybean now, and hearing a lot about corn earworm there. And I see on slide 14, it seems to indicate that maybe the second generation is providing more comprehensive protection. But could you just qualify if the Intacta that\u2019s out there in the market today will be giving farmers a level of protection against corn earworm? Or is that something that\u2019s coming in the second generation one?","Robert Fraley","We\u2019re seeing, as Brett mentioned, a pretty heavy insect pressure across parts of the Brazil production areas, and the Intacta product has performed very well against caterpillar pressure, particularly in the earworm. As we bring the second generation product, with multiple modes of action, that performance will only increase, as will the durability of performance of the product. And we\u2019re working on the third generation product as well, with additional weed and insect control benefits. So it\u2019s clearly a major opportunity for technology and we have a pipeline of products that are very targeted to bring innovations over the next decade.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Cox from Piper Jaffray.","Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray ","My first question is, I was a bit surprised to see the decline in corn gross profit, given your commentary around the biotech mix benefit in Latin America. I guess not withstanding some of the acreage issues there. But I was wondering if you could provide me maybe a bit more color around what drove this year over year decline in Q1.","Pierre Courduroux ","Very consistently, what we were expecting, so what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter is first, what Brett was mentioning, I mean, in South America, both in Brazil and Argentina, we are seeing the trait upgrades we were expecting. So from a pure business perspective, things are going really well. However, as you mentioned, this is balanced by the reduction in acres that we\u2019ve been seeing in South America and that we were anticipating. ","And the other factor that\u2019s been playing in the first quarter, and that we are watching very closely, is the currency. The real compared to last year has been way weaker against the U.S. dollar, and that\u2019s something that we are watching, and taking a good look at, at this point in time. ","But overall, I think what\u2019s really important is really the margin improvement. We are very consistent with what we were expecting, and very consistent with our plans at this point in time.","Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray ","And then just one quick follow up on FieldScripts. I think Rob mentioned in the prepared remarks that it\u2019s important to get the first few hundred thousand acres done right, and is that a fair estimate for your expectations for FieldScripts this year, somewhere in that few hundred thousand acre range?","Hugh Grant ","It will be on that order. I think the name of the game at the start of this, to Brett\u2019s point on combining this group and letting David run it, the name of the game is happy, satisfied customers, really driving that experience and building subscription acres. I think we\u2019ll be on that kind of order in the first year.","You know, the news this morning of the MOU with Winfield, I think is really huge. They\u2019re the early pioneers in this space, they\u2019ve done a bunch of work across a number of crops, and I\u2019m really delighted that we\u2019re strengthening and building that relationship with the team there. They\u2019re really good people.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan ","A couple of questions for Pierre. Did you collect any meaningful amount of revenues from your new Dupont royalty arrangement? And did that show up in the soybean gross profit line? And secondly, on your share repurchase, you bought back $561 million worth of stock, but your fully diluted shares actually went up sequentially from 531.5 to 532.6. So how did that happen?","Pierre Courduroux ","Regarding the first question, there\u2019s no revenue associated with our agreement with Pioneer booked in the first quarter. So the answer to that is no. All the revenue is coming from our Brazil business, which basically is related to Intacta. So that\u2019s a big upside for us this year. And we are right on track there. And the second element is also the early season in the U.S., where we see very, very good momentum. ","Regarding your questions regarding shares, one of the factors you see playing in the first quarter is the buybacks, but also some of the dilution factors we had related to our stock options programs. On the accuracy of the numbers, I\u2019ll need to come back to those, but basically overall, when we\u2019re looking at it from a pure quarter to quarter comparison, year-to-year we\u2019ve been reducing by 8 million. ","I think you\u2019re comparing with the end of August, and I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. But from a year-end to year-end, we\u2019ve been able to reduce our share count by about 8 million now. Within the quarter you may have seen some dilution effects related to stock options. We may have to come back to you on this one. ","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan ","And then just a quick follow up, were your glyphosate volumes up in the quarter, or down?","Pierre Courduroux ","Volumes were marginally up. We\u2019re seeing some timing benefits in the first quarter. What is really important, I think, beyond the pure volume side, and there is some, is the portfolio, the breakdown in between branded and nonbranded products has been really favorable to us in the first quarter. And remember also when you\u2019re drawing the comparisons with last year\u2019s numbers, in the first quarter last year we didn\u2019t have the prices set at the same level as we\u2019ve seen for the rest of the year, so in this first quarter you\u2019re seeing a huge catch up in terms of pricing to get us consistent with the last three quarters of last year. That\u2019s kind of the way it\u2019s been playing out.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial ","Question for Rob on R&D. With the new platforms, precision planting and biologics, what impact is this going to have on R&D spending in both absolute dollars and percentage of sales in terms of perhaps a higher rate of growth? And you used to talk about how seeds and genomics R&D was roughly split 50-50 between breeding and biotech. How would you break it out with these two new platforms?","Robert Fraley ","In general, we\u2019re just starting the investment on the microbes and the BioDirect and the other IT platform, so there\u2019s still, overall, a small portion of the R&D engine. I think when you look at our overall projections and expectations, I think we\u2019ll still continue to be in that 11-12% band in terms of sales. ","And I always make the point that one of the things that we\u2019re able to capture and take advantage on is just the incredible efficiency gains that we get, both as a result of the new technology platforms. You know, I give the example of the cost of sequencing, the cost and data point per data marker is dramatically down. We\u2019re a lot more efficient in terms of our use of IT tools across our breeding and R&D efforts. ","So I expect us to stay in that band. We might have seen a little bit of uptick in the first quarter, because as was mentioned on the call we\u2019ve had a number of product launches and a few startups, particularly with the microbes and some of the BioDirect projects. But I see us staying in that historical band as a percentage of sales. ","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial ","Just a follow up, on corn rootworm 3, given your advance to phase 4, and given the greater efficacy and durability of RNAi versus BT, what are your thoughts as to the kind of value that\u2019s inherent in that product in terms of a premium over what you might be able to charge on existing corn rootworm control products?","Robert Fraley ","I would never take away the opportunity to price from Brett, but what I can tell you is from field testing this last year, the performance is outstanding, and the synergy. And we will deploy, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, as an upgrade to Smartstax, and it will become our Smartstax Pro product towards the end of this decade. You know, having a new mode of action against a pest that is as important as corn rootworm, I think is a really big deal. Now that we\u2019ve launched Intacta, I think you have to look at both the Smartstax Pro and the Roundup Ready 2 Extend in soybean and cotton as really the next two big biotech blockbusters coming out of the pipeline.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse Group. ","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse Group","You mentioned this briefly on the call, but I noticed there\u2019s some interesting advancements in cotton, on both the biotech and breeding fronts. Can you just further hit on some general thoughts here concerning the competitive oppositioning and the potential this market could bring over the next year or two given it hasn\u2019t been a huge investor focus recently?","Hugh Grant ","I\u2019ll maybe ask Rob to say a bit more on the technology, but the interesting thing in cotton is, as in all these crops, performance really counts. And in cotton, it really really counts. And you see quite significant share movement when you have that performance edge. So I think the increment that Rob talked about today can translate into share gain in the next couple of seasons. And that cotton grower, given the economics of cotton right now and how much pressure there is, they\u2019re looking for that next opportunity. But Rob, you talked about significant gains. Anything else?","Robert Fraley ","Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of exciting new technology targeted into cotton. I mentioned the breeding gains that really come from the full deployment of our markers. We\u2019ve also seen some really nice breeding trait technologies, and I specifically highlighted the nematode tolerance. So then on the biotech front, the Roundup Ready 2 Extend will be a major technology addition for U.S. and South America growers. And we continue to make progress on the advancement of Bollgard III. ","So the challenge in cotton is not the technology platform. The acres are more limited in cotton than in other crops. As you know, in Australia our market tends to be regulated by the amount of water and rainfall, and we\u2019ve seen the challenges of course in India with the slowdown in regulatory acceptance for biotech products. ","But overall, cotton remains an important crop for us. It\u2019s a crop that we invest in proportionately to the fact that it is probably the third largest crop platform in our portfolio. But we also recognize that it\u2019s one that we have to ensure that we extract the appropriate value for the technology. ","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse Group ","And just a quick follow up on some of the corn questions earlier. Given the South American corn acreage decline, how should we think about the offsets of some Eastern European acreage growth, particularly in the Ukraine and Romania? And if you could just give a quick overview of what you\u2019re seeing there, including any market share developments?","Brett Begemann ","I think that\u2019s one of the big advantages we have today, is the geographic balance of our portfolio. Whether those corn acres happen in South America or Eastern Europe or in the U.S., we\u2019re in a position to participate in a significant way. I think it\u2019s really important, when we talk about corn acres, to step all the way back to the broad picture. ","The reality is corn demand continues to grow around the world, and we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s changing our expectation with that overall demand growth. Sure, we\u2019ve seen the acres pull back a little bit in South America. There\u2019s some discussion about where they\u2019re going to be in the U.S. this coming year and what that means for Eastern Europe. ","But at the end of the day, global demand is continuing to grow for corn. We have to figure out how we can increase the productivity of corn, and the acres are going to be a component of that that\u2019s going to be a variable every year. And rather than trying to guess acres every year, we\u2019re focused on the big demand for corn, how do we increase productivity, and we\u2019ll use those tools on whatever acres get planted each year, because our profitability is going to come out of increasing the productivity and bringing new technology and tools and suites of tools to the farmer. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","How would you assess the level of competitive intensity in U.S. corn this year versus last year? And specifically, I was wondering if you could comment on where you think your price mix contributions are tracking versus your target of up 5% to 10%?","Hugh Grant ","I\u2019d say this was more a normalized year in every respect, in terms of pace, in terms of drawdown of orders, the builds, and the order book, and also competitive intensity. So we saw some hot spots. But Brett, how would you compare it to last year?","Brett Begemann ","I would say that the thing that we have to be careful of is when we start comparing to last year, with the tight seed supply no one was too interested in being too aggressive with anything. But what I see out there in the marketplace today is more like what I would call normal, when most seed companies are in a good position with supply, and the market\u2019s a little tighter because there\u2019s discussion about less acres and those kinds of things. It\u2019s moving at a normal pace. ","I\u2019d call it normal. I\u2019m not overly concerned about the activity that\u2019s out there. You manage the hotspots, and you move on. And we\u2019re fortunate today to have such a broad, deep portfolio of products that we\u2019re offering in the marketplace, that it sets us up well to participate in those conversations. ","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then as a follow up, for Brett, on the subject of glyphosate. It looks like we\u2019ve seen Chinese technical grade prices come off over the last three months or so. What implications would you expect for Monsanto\u2019s prices and volumes as the year progresses? And perhaps you could provide a bit more color on where your mix of branded product stands today, and how that\u2019s trending?","Brett Begemann ","Let me start with where you ended. As I look at the Roundup business, as I mentioned, our mix of branded product is the highest it\u2019s been in many years. So I feel really good about that, and I see that intensifying this year, particularly with the increase in acres of soybeans in North and South America. And over the top applications tend to prefer the Roundup brand. So we\u2019re in a good place there.","I kind of look at Roundup as, you know, we have a six month line of sight on what\u2019s going on in Roundup. And we don\u2019t pay as much attention to what\u2019s going on with acid prices out of China as we do what the generics are doing, and how they\u2019re pricing in the marketplace. ","But as I look at that next six months or so, I don\u2019t see a lot of change occurring in it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking at it as flattish prices to what we\u2019re seeing today. The step up we got in this first quarter, as Pierre already mentioned, was the catchup in the first quarter year over year comparison to where we were last year. ","So I don\u2019t see a lot of change. Our history has been in that $10 to $12 range. We\u2019re kind of floating towards the high end of that $12 range, and I still feel like, as we look to this year, that\u2019s going to be a reasonable place. But I still think it\u2019s flattish as we go through the next six months. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank ","Given last week\u2019s Cheerios news, what\u2019s your view on this potential growing consumer resistance to GMOs and what can you guys do to offset that or put your case forward more aggressively?","Hugh Grant ","The interesting thing with Cheerios, or with that particular brand, is they\u2019re made from oats. And there are no biotech oats in existence today. You know, we\u2019ve thought for years that we would support voluntary labeling, and that that was up to companies to do. I think what you saw last week was the first real live example of true voluntary labeling, and probably a little bit of marketing as well. ","I would say this, the last six to eight months now, we\u2019ve had a better dialogue with the broad food industry than I\u2019ve seen in the previous 10 years. The back end of last year, September\/October last year, you saw the food industry led by GMA getting out there and posting websites that talked about the safety and benefits of these technologies. ","So it\u2019s a lively debate. I think we\u2019re going to see more of these market initiatives and more voluntary labeling. But I like the fact that there\u2019s a dialogue, and I like the fact that the food industry is in the game and is actively discussing these technologies. It\u2019s a lot healthier than it\u2019s been the last 10 years, I think. ","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank ","And just a quick follow up for Brett. Just on ag productivity, is your guidance still the same for full year, flat to up modestly? Or is it a little bit stronger than that now given the strong Q1?","Brett Begemann ","I think it\u2019s very consistent. It\u2019s playing out as we had expected. We expected the step up in first quarter. But I\u2019m still looking at pricing being flattish for the year. So it\u2019s as expected.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Gulley from BGC Financial.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial ","Rob, I\u2019ve got a question regarding yield in the field. It has to do with the kind of data you need to help growers make better decisions. Are you going to need to supplement the data you\u2019re getting from weather, from Climate Corp, or something else, the field surveillance? I\u2019m thinking in terms of robotics or something like that. Is that necessary to drive this forward? Or do you have enough to work with now?","Robert Fraley ","In general, for us, let\u2019s just focus on FieldScripts, which are the product that we\u2019ll launch this spring. And we did the Ground Breakers last year. And for me, the highlight of the Ground Breakers, we tested a couple of different scripts, and our high intensity script, where we had knowledge that we worked with the grower both on past crop history, on fertilization levels, gave us a script that put us in the 5 to 10 bushel per acre yield benefit. So the information that we need to move forward with that first generation script, I think we\u2019ve proven that and tested that last year.","You know, the other big thing that came from the testing last year was how well the system worked in terms of the wireless transmission, the delivery, the reliability, and the robustness of the iPad system that we have in the tractor cab. So I feel really good about our ability to execute on that first generation script and deliver value to growers, and we know clearly the information content there that\u2019s important to deliver that yield benefit to the grower. ","What we\u2019ll see with the benefit from the Climate Corp capability is we\u2019ll add to that basic script a weather-enhanced version. So we\u2019ll be able to make even better selections on hybrids, make better recommendations on planting dates and which fields should be planted first. So that will only enhance the yield benefit of FieldScripts. ","And then on the part, I would just highlight, it was mentioned in the call, we\u2019re really working now to develop partnerships with the other companies that will expand on that base. And it\u2019s great to be able to announce the MOU today on the partnership with Winfield, because they\u2019re a leader in this space, and they bring both a footprint of additional crops that we\u2019re not participating in, and that will be a nice opportunity to create incremental value for both companies. ","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial ","And then in terms of helping farmers increase their profitability, I\u2019m intrigued by the comments you\u2019ve made so far on soil fertility and application rates. I know it\u2019s early days, and as you\u2019ve just indicated, you\u2019ve got a lot on your plate right now, but any long range view on what you can do to perhaps reduce application rates of various nutrients?","Robert Fraley ","I think that\u2019s something that we continue to work on. And as you see in our scripts, one of our next generation scripts will be variable nutrition. I think right now the most important benefit that we\u2019ll see, as we vary the population, we will need to vary the nutrient proportional to the seed planting density. So our first focus is to optimize the use of nutrition to optimize yield, not necessarily to reduce it. And that\u2019s the key. ","The other factor that comes in, that is being built into the models and really I think is going to be a key benefit of the integration of all the technology with Climate Corporation is we know that the nitrogen uptake is both weather conditioned and hybrid specific. So being able to bring together the unique knowledge of the hybrids with precise field weather history is going to be really important as we think not only about the initial applications of nutrients, but the side dressing and in-crop feeding that may also be very, very important.","Hugh Grant ","We\u2019ll get some nice insights from Winfield as well.","Bryan Hurley","I realize that we\u2019ve extended the conference call a little beyond our normal stopping time, so why don\u2019t we take two or three more questions here.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark Connelly - CLSA ","As you start to negotiate deals like Winfield, how are you thinking about your desire for market penetration versus maybe their desire for exclusivity? And is that going to be different in row crops versus fruits and vegetables?","Hugh Grant ","We haven\u2019t really done too much in fruits and vegetables yet. I guess as we think about the row crops, we\u2019re thinking about expanding that pie. I think our early philosophy on broad licensing continues to apply. So the ethos of getting as many people in as we possibly can. I think the days of exclusivity are long behind us. And as I mentioned at the start, the grower experience, building grower confidence and really really driving subscription acres, is the goal. But I\u2019m very very pleased that Winfield is the first partner up on the platform, and I look forward to the days when we\u2019re announcing more in the future.","Mark Connelly - CLSA ","And if I could just ask you a quick question to Dr. Fraley, in the past, sometimes your decision on pipeline dropouts have been almost as important as the things you move forward to. For example, when you decided that the corn for ethanol wasn\u2019t attractive. Is there anything like that in the pipeline that\u2019s dropping out this year that represents a major decision or significant shift for you?","Robert Fraley ","There\u2019s not really anything major this year. I think probably the only project that I\u2019m aware of that dropped out of the pipeline is we\u2019ve made a decision to stop some of the yield work in cotton that was part of the BASF collaboration. But that was a pretty minor effort. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we\u2019ve extended that relationship, and it\u2019s really focused on bringing those advanced yield traits in corn to the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities ","Apologies for beating a dead horse here on this ag productivity, but it was the best level that it\u2019s been in like five years. Brett, I know you said that you expect flat pricing, but are you going to continue to see the mix of branded versus nonbranded increase, which obviously would bode well for your gross profit for the rest of the year? And I think you indicated that your expectation is to see it reach normalized levels, which I believe is a level below here. When are you thinking? What kind of timeframe are you thinking about that?","Robert Fraley ","As I look at the year, I really look at it as good visibility for the next six months, and I don\u2019t see any drivers that really encourage significant change in pricing. But of course we\u2019ll always monitor that and watch where the generics are in the marketplace. We\u2019re already at some of the highest levels of brand versus nonbrand that we\u2019ve been in a number of years, and yes, that continues to strengthen. And part of what\u2019s strengthening that this year is the higher soybean acres, and the demand for the over top product. ","I remind you that when we think about our Roundup business, we make around 300 million gallons and sell around 300 million gallons. So yes, we\u2019ll continue to improve with the mix gain, and we\u2019ll do that as we can throughout the year. But we won\u2019t have additional volume.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then on TCC, they announced that they were launching Climate Pro while we were at the investor day in November. What\u2019s been the receptivity for Climate Pro? And can you share with us any expectations in terms of acres for fiscal \u201914 or fiscal \u201915?","Brett Begemann","I have to tell you, I\u2019m really excited about that whole space, as I shared on the call. We just brought all those businesses together between the Climate Corporation, our IFS work that we had already going on, and Precision, and putting that into a new business platform. And David\u2019s leading that, and that\u2019s all feeling really good. And yes, they launched the Climate Pro. ","I would tell you, just like Rob said, this is an area where I see more farmer interest than most anything we\u2019ve done in quite some time. And our focus in the early years, number one, is going to be around the whole suite of things that we\u2019re bringing forward, and making sure that we help the farmer leverage the whole suite to get the biggest impact, buying the best genetics, protecting it as best that they can with what\u2019s in the bag, and then what we can do to help them grow that crop. ","And our focus is going to be on around a few hundred thousand acres in the early period with this, to really make sure the farmer has a great experience, and that gives us the momentum to build from. So this is strategically more about a great farmer experience than it is about acres in the near term, and then we\u2019ll take it further beyond that. But Climate Pro will be a component of that. ","Robert Fraley ","Why don\u2019t we take one last question and then we\u2019ll wrap up with some final remarks by Hugh.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS ","In terms of the Roundup pricing adjustment, should we think about the first quarter as annually being this sort of catch up, either up or down, on your pricing relative to generics?","Brett Begemann ","I look at it as it was coincidental, that the pricing was somewhat stable through the last three quarters of last year, and that we\u2019re catching up in this one. As I said, our price adjustments going forward over the year are going to be more based on where the generics are in the marketplace, so depending on when they choose to move around, that\u2019s going to drive ours. So I think it\u2019s coincidental, that it just happens to be the first quarter catch up, whether it\u2019s up or down.","John Roberts - UBS ","And then secondly, Rob, you kind of slipped in the wheat advancement to phase 2 in the appendix there. While it\u2019s technically moved forward, has anything market-wise changed in terms of customer interest or receptiveness around having GM wheat?","Robert Fraley ","I\u2019m glad you noticed that. Yeah, we\u2019ve field tested and advanced one of the first wheat biotech products based on improvements in weed control. And from an overall market perspective, the grain industry and the wheat industry, specifically the wheat trade industry, has remained very interested and supportive of biotech advances.","I mean, a wheat farmer is generally also a corn and soybean farmer, and they understand the benefits of the technology and the wheat industry has watched the benefits that this technology has brought to both corn and soybean. And so we continue to make advances. We\u2019re still several years away from product launch, but it\u2019s nice to see those products in the pipeline. Thanks for noticing.","Hugh Grant ","And just to reemphasize Brett\u2019s point, there is no seasonality of timing in this. We lay that Roundup brand price really close to that Chinese generic [unintelligible] price. So we\u2019re in no doubt that we continue to compete with that Chinese generic material.","So let me wrap up. I\u2019m conscious of the time this morning. So let me begin by thanking everybody for joining us on this call. As I mentioned in my opening, there\u2019s no doubt that the first quarter, increasingly, provides an important milestone in affirming our confidence, and it reinforces the 2014 opportunity. ","And in the near term, I think we\u2019re seeing the right indicators for the important opportunities in Latin America as well as the ongoing delivery of our core businesses in the U.S. And that\u2019s reflected in our confidence in delivering on our outlook, even in a year where agriculture is more variable than it\u2019s been in the past few. ","Beyond this year, with the R&D update that Rob walked through today, you can see that we\u2019re in a better position than ever to add waves of technology that come together in the seed, in the bag, and in the field. And today, as we bring together the Climate Corp, IFS, and Precision Planting, we see the opportunity for collaboration and open architecture, with equipment partners, with crop nutrition, and with grain partners going forward. And that\u2019s what will continue to drive our opportunities into the future.","So on behalf of the team here, I want to wish all the very best to you and yours as we start another new year. Thank you very much for your participation.

Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Meyer","Thank you, Melissa. Happy New Year, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, President and Chief Operating Officer; Pierre Courduroux, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Robb Fraley, our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me from the Investor Relations team is Ben Kampelman.","Today, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline update on this call, as led by Dr. Fraley, as well as an overview of our first quarter results. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.","We've provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.","First, let me review our first quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. We delivered another strong performance with as reported earnings per share of $0.38 and ongoing earnings per share of $0.41 in the first quarter, well above the prior year as reported earnings per share of $0.07 and ongoing earnings per share of $0.21, driven by the expected strong start to our business in South America.","With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.","Hugh Grant","Thanks, Laura. Happy new year, and good morning to everybody who's joining us today. Our teams have continued to remain focused on our top two priorities, namely, delivering our business goals while working towards closure on the deal to combine with Bayer. These business goals include advancing our pipeline, a pipeline that not only leads the industry, but serves the industry through our broad licensing strategy, and progress in our sustainability commitments, as noted in our report from just a few weeks ago.","Let's begin with an update of the status of the Bayer merger, as shown on Slide 5. With Bayer leading the regulatory process, we continue to cooperate with regulators, and we see progress, as expected. The antitrust approvals continued to increase, and we've now received about half of them. In addition, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, or CFIUS, has completed its review, and there are no unresolved national security concerns. Overall, we continue to remain optimistic about our collective ability to secure the required approvals for the deal in the early part of 2018. And even as we progress closer to the expected closure of the combination, our teams have maintained their focus on the business. We delivered solid first quarter results with strong growth, driven by Intacta soybeans in South America and improved pricing in glyphosate.","Our commercial teams have done a great job in delivering today's products to our customers, while our technology teams continue to advance the products of tomorrow, as shown on Slide 6. In fact, 2017 delivered a record number of pipeline advancements.","Our common products and our flagship seed brands, DEKALB, ASGROW and Deltapine, once again set yield advantages in corn, soy and cotton, while our newest platform, Climate FieldView, delivered a remarkable 17 advancements, expanded geographically and added new partners and licensees, ultimately offering more options to more farmers around the globe.","The outlook for our latest technologies remains strong in the year ahead, as the order mix and sales to date further validate the acre expectations that we laid out for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton and Intacta soybeans.","Finally, we're pleased with regulators' continued affirmation of glyphosate safety. In November, we received the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe for five years, which while less than the 15 years that the science supported, still ensures this much-needed tool remains available for growers. More recently, in December, the EPA issued a draft human health risk assessment concluding that glyphosate is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans, which is the most favorable classification for a chemistry. Their conclusions are consistent with all the other regulatory science reviews from the past 40 years, as well as the 2017 Ag Health Study conducted by the National Institute of Health. Once again, IARC continues to be the lone outlier in their assessment of glyphosate, drawing conclusions contrary to the overwhelming consensus of regulatory authorities and experts around the world.","As we look to the balance of this year, we continue to expect strong adoption of our newest technologies and improved pricing for glyphosate to be tempered by challenging global corn and soybean prices even as demand for both continues to grow, as shown on Slide 7. Beyond that, we will refrain from further specifics as we continue to anticipate closing on the combination with Bayer in the early part of 2018. Until then, we look forward to the possibilities our combined teams have the potential to create and make broadly available for growers around the globe as shown on Slide 8.","So with that brief introduction, let me pass it to Brett to share our operational priorities for the rest of fiscal year '18. Brett?","Brett Begemann","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. We've just closed out a great first quarter in South America. Here in the U.S., we're taking orders and moving corn and soybean seed into place for planting, albeit at a slower pace than typical due to the late harvest and anticipated corn acres being lower than we originally planned. For soybeans, as shown on Slide 9, we're off to a great start as we delivered 30% growth in global soybean gross profit year-on-year in quarter one, coupled with impressive margin improvement.","Let's start with Intacta on Slide 10. The adoption of this trait continues its dramatic ascent, as we're on pace to reach 60 million acres in South America, while the second generation of the technology is not far behind. In addition, the team delivered improved prices in local currency in the first quarter as we expected, helping to recover some of the value lost to currency over the past few years. Finally, in Argentina, the point of delivery royalty capture system was renewed for another year, and the system continues to gain integrity.","Moving to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend on Slide 11. Despite some headlines to the contrary, the weed control yield performance and adoption of this technology has been simply outstanding. The Roundup Ready Xtend system yield results from our trials are in, and the 2017 performance further reinforces the expected demand with a 5.7 bushel per acre yield advantage compared to the Liberty Link system. Further, for soybean growers who were surveyed and applied Xtendimax Herbicide with VaporGrip technology this past season, 97% reported weed control satisfaction. And finally, our branded order book mix for soybeans indicates that 80% of our demand is for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, which bolsters our confidence in reaching an estimated 40 million acres in fiscal year 2018. We've received 32 of the 34 state labels we were seeking for Xtendimax Herbicide with VaporGrip technology, and we remain dedicated to improving our customers' experience with the technology through grower education efforts, tools and training.","Let's move next to corn, as shown on Slide 12, where we now expect corn acres for the U.S. and the second season of Brazil to be relatively flat with the prior year, contrary to the markets and our own earlier expectations. Our overall gross profit declined in the first quarter, mostly due to lower volumes. A significant portion of this was in the U.S. and is expected to be recovered later in the year, as some was related to lower corn acres in Brazil as anticipated. In our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, we expect to continue to launch new premium price hybrids globally and drive genetic share gains based on yield advantages of our hybrids -- that our hybrids convey. We also expect to expand the footprint of our newest offerings in the U.S., which includes the DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids and Trecepta corn as our next generation of aboveground insect control, which is launching in select states.","Moving to our complementary crops, as shown on Slide 13. Cotton gross profit is essentially flat in the first quarter. We saw truly remarkable adoption of Bollgard 3 Cotton in Australia, as virtually the entire market transitioned in 2 short seasons, and the premium from this new technology offset the declines in planted acres there. In the U.S., we now expect more than 6 million acres of Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton, which is expected to be coupled with continued brand share gains following the significant gains from 2016 and 2017.","Moving beyond seed technologies, the Climate FieldView platform continues to see major advancements, as outlined on Slides 14 and 15. It continues to expand globally, with our recent announcement of our prelaunch in Germany, France and the Ukraine adding to our existing business in Brazil, Canada and the United States. In addition, we added yet another digital imaging partner to the platform in the U.S. and three new partners in Brazil while we continued discussions with several other potential partners in this space. Finally, our target for paid acres for the year remains at more than 50 million acres, more than a 40% increase over 2017.","Let's close with Ag productivity. We realized price increases over the prior year in the first quarter, as the generic pricing for glyphosate continues to improve, and we now expect improved prices to continue for the rest of the fiscal year, consistent with our strategy. In addition, volumes sold of Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology are expected to continue to grow with the expanding Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybean acres.","Overall, our teams continue to remain engaged and dedicated to our two priorities, with an emphasis on continuing to deliver the products and services our customers need and value to effectively compete in this challenging market.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial review. Pierre?","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In the first quarter, our teams did an excellent job converting new technology expansion, improved glyphosate pricing and asset sales gains into earnings per share growth. For the quarter, we delivered $0.38 of as reporting earnings per share and $0.41 of ongoing earnings per share compared to, respectively, $0.07 of as reporting earnings per share and $0.21 of ongoing earnings per share in the prior year.","Our free cash flow for the quarter was $874 million, a decline versus the prior year when we delivered $1.1 billion. This decrease in free cash flow was primarily due to increased outflows from accruals, market funding and incentive payments stemming from the growth in the business in the prior year, as well as an increase in CapEx as we ramp up our dicamba plant investments as planned.","Shifting back to earnings per share. Despite the slow start in the U.S. season, we delivered solid earnings growth in the quarter, driven by pricing and volume growth in Intacta in South America, complemented by improved pricing in glyphosate and by the more than $85 million in gains from the sale of assets, the most significant of which was from the sale of the Precision Planting business to AGCO.","SG&A and R&D increased, mostly due to higher commissions, POD cost and bad debt expense associated with the growth in South America, as well as from inflationary increases and increased spend on R&D. Meanwhile, the tax rate decreased to a more normalized level due to the reduction in the valuation and allowance in Argentina, as well as from a favorable shift in the discrete items.","Consistent with our prior quarterly earnings call, I once again share some qualitative highlights on the outlook for the year, but will not provide specific financial guidance given the pending combination with Bayer. The growth drivers for our business for this year are expected to be derived from continued improvement in pricing for glyphosate, plus the adoption of new technologies in seeds and genomic, specifically the nutrition and pricing from Intacta, continued penetration of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and share gains from Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton, as well as reductions in related launch costs and share gains from the introduction of new corn hybrids globally, particularly from the expansion of Disease Shield and the launch of Trecepta in the United States.","We anticipate completing our restructuring and cost savings initiatives, beginning fiscal year '15 as outlined on Slide 16, and expect our SG&A R&D to be down to slightly -- down slightly year-over-year despite the increase in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the asset sales gains and licensing contribution from strategic portfolio management are expected to be about 30% below the roughly $350 million pretax average annual contribution we've seen for the last three years.","We were pleased to see the recent passage of the U.S. tax reform legislation and expect it to have a positive impact on our effective tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2019. For the current fiscal year, we are still completing our full assessment, but our early estimates indicate that our effective tax rate should not exceed 30% and has the potential to be materially lower.","Overall, with a strong start in the first quarter, combined with the puts and takes I've just outlined for the full year, we continue to expect nice growth in our pretax income for fiscal year '18 and will remain disciplined as we monitor the evolution of U.S. corn and soybean plantings through the spring.","With that, I will now pass it to Robb to share the update on the pipeline. Robb?","Robert Fraley","Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everybody on the phone. This year, we advanced a record number of projects, spanning all platforms, and allowing us to continue to fuel innovation for the industry through our broad licensing approach. Our pipeline is stronger than it's ever been, as evidenced by Slide 3 in our pipeline update slides. In fact, not only is this the fifth consecutive year of more than 20 pipeline advancements, but even with the launches of the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system and products like Trecepta corn, we still expect up to $25 billion in peak revenues from the core pipeline alone, and newer platforms like Climate FieldView, digital ag and biologicals are all upsides.","Let's begin with what farmers are experiencing today, as shown on Slide 4. DEKALB is outperforming competitive corn products for the 12th consecutive year, while Asgrow soybeans and Deltapine cotton have done the same for eight years. What's even more exciting is we're starting to see the first wave of seed products developed with artificial intelligence and advanced marker technologies reaching customer fields. Over 50% of the new 2017 U.S. corn deployment class were developed with these technologies. And in our breeding trials, we saw a 30% increase in the yield advantages of this deployment class versus our key competitor's hybrids. Performance of these products has been excellent, and it reinforces the impact that new precision breeding technologies can have on our ability to accelerate the rate of gain across our corn row crops.","Moving to the next generations of biotech solutions for weed and insect control, the coming decade looks bright, as shown on Slide 5 and 6. It begins with Trecepta corn, which is launching this year. This is a product targeted for certain areas of the U.S. where aboveground caterpillar pests are particularly acute, but belowground insect pressure isn't necessarily a threat. And coming right behind is the fourth and fifth generations of aboveground insect control for corn that just advanced. And for those areas with rootworm challenges, SmartStax PRO corn continues to make strides within Phase 4 of our pipeline, and we have already initiated early licensing discussions with several companies. This product is designed to offer growers a unique RNAi approach to manage insect resistance and expand control to supplement what is currently available in SmartStax.","Switching from corn to soybeans on Slide 7 and 8, the next generation soybean trait upgrades are on the horizon. In addition to the great weed control farmers are experiencing with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, the next generation adds glufosinate tolerance to the package. And with the tremendous success of Intacta, it's encouraging to see both the second and third generations close behind with additional modes of action and expanded spectrum.","Equally as exciting as the new traits are the new herbicide formulations that have advanced in several phases of the pipeline. This includes our new PPO herbicide formulation through our collaboration with Sumitomo, who developed the herbicide. This new formulation is expected to be paired with our fifth generation of herbicide tolerance technology, also in Phase 1, and tools like these give growers new options to maintain effective weed resistance management.","Cotton, as showed on Slide 9, had numerous advancements. Lygus and thrips control cotton, an industry-first, based on an innovative biotech solution for controlling piercing, sucking insects, advanced to Phase 4, and we expect to commercialize this technology in the next 2 to 3 years. And to supplement the Bollgard franchise, Bollgard 4 now moves to Phase 2, which ensures the continued efficacy of the platform for growers in the United States and Australia.","We've had several advancements in seed applied solutions, as shown in Slide 10, which included 4 advancements from the BioAg Alliance with Novozymes. In addition, NemaStrike Technology, a novel nematicide, with a fit across 125 million acres of corn, soybeans and cotton, advanced to launch. We currently anticipate our second round of ground breaker trials this spring and remain excited about the yield advantage of the product. Look for an update on our commercialization plans later in the second quarter.","Let's move next to Climate FieldView platform on Slide 11, which is advancing rapidly. In fact, we had 17 advancements over the course of the year, and this underscores the difference in the pace of advancement between software and data development versus that of traditional chemistry and biology. Two of these advancements included very promising launches for the coming season, manual fertility scripting and additional zone sources from imagery that improve our planting scripts. One of the areas I'm most excited about is the subfield management of nitrogen, which allows growers to further optimize the rates and placements of their most expensive input. I'm also very encouraged by the advancement of the corn disease diagnostic tool. This tool has the potential to leverage the latest in machine learning to diagnose a corn disease using a simple cellphone camera scan of an affected leaf. This allows a grower to take quick action to protect yield.","As we close out the annual review of our technologies, I'd like to end with an update on our advances in gene editing on Slide 12, which we are viewing as a true innovation in plant breeding. Over the course of the last year, we inked numerous agreements in this space, which we think can accelerate our opportunity to drive genetic gain and R&D efficiency. Gene editing is a key tool that can accelerate the delivery of breeding traits and gene stacks, reduce cost and potentially open up new markets, all while building upon the industry-leading breeding and testing capabilities that we have today.","Looking ahead on Slide 13, the combination with Bayer will allow our two companies to accelerate the pace of innovation through our complementary skills and shared vision. Our R&D team is excited and energized by the new areas of scientific advancement we expect to unlock by combining with Bayer, which will allow us to bring more new products to farmers faster.","Thank you. And with that, I'll pass it on to Laura for Q&A.","Laura Meyer","Thanks, Rob. With that, we'd like to open the call for 20 minutes of questions. [Operator Instructions]. Melissa, we're ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson","One of the big stories of the last year has been off-target crop damage from improper use of dicamba, and I know there's a new EPA label requirements and some state restrictions on application windows. How do you see that affecting the overall Xtend opportunities as we go forward? And perhaps, Robb, you could address, there's been some academics talking about how volatility from these new formulations may be driving some of these off-target damage as well.","Hugh Grant","Maybe, Brett, a quick word on the market demand. And then Robb, specifically on the progress we've made in formulations.","Brett Begemann","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, Don. Good to hear from you. As I think about Xtend, as I said in the prepared remarks, I'm really, really pleased with what we were able to accomplish last year, as you noted. It was a very successful launch on 20-plus million acres of soybeans. I think the news that continues to come out of that continues to make it even more favorable now that we have the summary on the yields were 5.7 bushel a yield benefit. We got the data back from the farmers that used Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology, 97% satisfaction on weed control. And that points to what we're seeing now in our order book, where 80% of our brand of business is Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. So it's really clear that farmers have a lot of confidence in this product too, and it delivered what was expected. To your point, there were some challenges last year with applications, no doubt about that. And we've worked extensively with everyone in the industry to help farmers with additional training. And Robb, I'll let you speak a little bit more to some of those actions, and some of the work with others in the industry.","Robert Fraley","Sure. As Brett said, we're excited with this year. I mean to have a product launch on over 25 million acres is pretty remarkable. I think our goal now is to make sure that all farmers have a great experience going into 2018. I think we're well-positioned. I mean, I think the changes have been made with the EPA label, which has now been approved by 32 out of 34 states, and I think Minnesota will join that group within a few days. It's really encouraging. We bolstered that with very strong training programs. But I think to the heart of your question, Don, I mean, we took the time and the effort to visit with every farmer who filed a concern with us. And the good news in all of that evaluation was in the vast majority, over 90% of the situations we reviewed, the solution set is easily addressed with the proper use of the field boundaries and buffers and more training on appropriate formulations and use of nozzles.","We're very confident in our review of both the farmer results and in the thousands of tests that we've done on the reduced volatility Xtendimax product that the product can be used effectively and safely, and we're excited as we go into this year to ensure that farmers have that great experience. And to Brett's point, I mean, the growers are excited. We're seeing strong demand for the product, and to touch 40 million acres in the second year is a pretty remarkable story.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Just a question on Intacta. Can you give us a sense of the price achievement that you're realizing? Is it the totality of the reduction in the original discount that was offered? Or do you actually take any incremental price increases from there? And I guess, I ask vis-\u00e0-vis, there's -- was some press reports about the Brazilian farmers looking to challenge the validity of the Intacta patent, so any update on that as well would be helpful.","Brett Begemann","Good morning, Vincent, so good to hear from you. Happy New Year. As we look at Intacta, as I mentioned and we mentioned in the last call, we had a full expectation to raise our price based on the value that Intacta continued to deliver in the marketplace. Along with that, there was some, as you mentioned, some adjustments put in place with the transition from Roundup Ready 1 to Intacta in South America, and some of those ran out. Some of those transition payments ran out last year. And we just went silent on those. So they just went away, and that in turn, increased the price. But yes, Vincent, we continue to look at the value that the product was delivering into farmers and continued to price to that value, so there were -- we took all of that and then some, as we went into pricing. On the patent front, we've been challenged multiple times in Brazil around the patents. This is another challenge of our patent estate. We have -- I remind you, we have multiple patents in place across Brazil addressing our technology down there, and we're confident that our position is strong and we'll prevail in this, but we'll continue to address it with those that are challenging us. But at this point in time, I feel good about our position.","Hugh Grant","Probably as confident as we've ever felt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar","Question on digital ag. You're going to 50 million acres this year. You seem to be investing quite a bit in digital ag and taking the platform global in Europe and Ukraine. So can you talk about how much are you investing this year? How much are you charging on average per acre, and when do you expect to become profitable in digital ag?","Pierre Courduroux","So P.J., good morning. So regarding the investments we've made in digital ag, I mean, I think the way to think about it is something fairly similar to what we've invested over the last couple of years. And I mean, we've done a couple of reallocation of resources and we feel this is a business that's well-funded and continuing to build a platform, as you mentioned, and that's really what we are trying to do in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. as well. Regarding what we charge on a per acre basis, I mean, if you remember, the way we've done that, I mean, it's really variable. And at this point in time, our focus is on building the platform, and some of our offering to the farmers is really based on the farm itself rather than the pure per acre basis. So the average by itself, as of today, may not be as relevant as what we wanted it to be in the future. And regarding the breakeven point of that business, we've always told that by the end of our LRP, we're expecting this business to break even, and that's still the time horizon we are shooting for. Really, what's important in 2018 for us, as it was in 2017, is really to build this platform and expand this platform.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steve Byrne","I have a question for Robb. You've clearly been driving genetic gain in corn and soybean seed with your molecular breeding and your genomic selection capabilities, but you're targeting a 30% increase in that rate of genetic gain. Would you say that, that is because you have a view of getting even more proficient at genomic selection? Or is this really a reflection of gene editing now in the toolbox that you're using for breeding?","Robert Fraley","Thanks, Steve, good question. The gains that we're seeing right now are really based on the use of the advanced marker technology, and also the machine learning. We've developed the computer algorithms based on our decade of marker experience to predict better combinations. And then the other piece that plays into that is all the work we've done on the breeding automation and the seed chippers. The use of markers is so effective today that we can analyze those crosses in those kernels coming right out of the greenhouse, which allows us to dramatically expand our testing capability. So that's what's driving the gain in the new releases. And but to your point, we see gene editing in the future as a major component of our breeding program. We've invested heavily this year in the technology and are fully deploying it across our breeding in both core crops and vegetables.","Operator","Our next question comes in the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort","I wanted to follow up. You had mentioned that in the U.S. maybe the corn sales season has gotten off to a slow start, but you expect it to catch up. I'm just curious, what has sort of caused that behavior? And then around the pricing, are we seeing apples-to-apples declines partially offset by new germplasm higher price points? Or can you help characterize what's going on in the pricing?","Brett Begemann","Good morning, Bob. Happy New Year. Corn is really an interesting crop when I think about it today. Who would have ever guessed if somebody would have told us last year that we would see the kind of production we had this year that we would still be looking at potentially 90 million acres of corn in the U.S., and while acres are going to be down in South America and probably in the U.S., it's a huge crop. It's a really important crop, and the demand around the world is still growing 1 billion bushels a year, as we seen again this year. So it speaks to we have to stay focused on corn, driving productivity gains, as Robb is talking about with yields, et cetera, because the world's demand is going to continue to grow and we got to meet it. We're living in a backdrop of where we've had four years now of that kind of production, which isn't normal.","And then you add that on to this year, where we, to your point of why is it slower, is a rough harvest in the U.S. Farmers really struggled. They get slow start for some of the northern ones because the market was slow to develop up there. We didn't have the heat and the growing degree days, so it's a slow harvest. The weather was not very cooperative in the Central Corn Belt, particularly in the eastern part of the Corn Belt really slowed it down. And that just delays farmers' decision-making process, fall applications of fertilizers. So I feel good about where we sit right now. Pricing, we knew it was going to be a very challenging environment going into it. We didn't have great expectations for significant price increases. We did increase prices on our new products as we always do, but when you use the value of less than $3.50 for corn, you don't get as much value for the increased yield, but you still get value, and we priced into that. Many of our products were flat as we talked about, the previous hybrids that were already out there.","So I don't have great hope for significant price improvement in the marketplace this year. But I would tell you, at this point, the competition, it's as robust as ever. It is a tough year, so everybody is fighting for the last acre. So we're going to see some of that continue. But at the end of the day, here's how I think about it, Bob, I don't know what the acres are going to be. I don't think they're going to be what we thought they were going to be in September. It's cold and snowy outside, and farmers trying to make their final decision. But here's what I'm really confident about, when it all shakes out and we get to August of next year, we're going to feel really good about where our share is in the U.S. corn market. That's what I feel really good about. We have the best products, the best market position. We're well-positioned in competing in the marketplace. Our share is going to do just fine. We're going to get our proportionate share of the corn market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson","The digital ag, at your last whistle stop, you had given some proof points from 2015 on the nitrogen health adviser, had said you were achieving maybe $13 an acre of savings on nitrogen for the farmers that were involved in that. Now with a couple more years of data in the subfield adviser, what is the gain, the savings for growers on nitrogen right now per acre that you're touting?","Hugh Grant","Joel, you're right. That was the conversation in the fields when you were there, and we've got a lot more data under our belt in this last season that's proven out well. Robb, maybe a few words on how the trials look this year.","Robert Fraley","Yes. I mean, I think to your point, the infield variable nitrogen advisers have been well received by growers. It's added another dimension. I think it's built on the same type of range of gains. We see a subset of growers who are saving nitrogen applications. We're seeing another set who are using that nitrogen reallocating across the field and driving yield. And I think the other exciting news on the nutrient front is we've now -- we've expanded it to P&K, which will be another key tool for farmers to both optimize their inputs and optimize yields across their fields. So we're very excited about the variable rate nitrogen and adding the P&K advisors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","There are record cold temperatures across the United States. In your opinion, does that already point to lower insect pressure to come in the new planting season? Or is it too soon to tell? And have environmental controls in China affected glyphosate production there?","Hugh Grant","Thanks for your questions, Jeff, but I think I'll see what Doc Fraley says. But I think the cold snap, it's too early to tell on. Bug populations are pretty resourceful.","Robert Fraley","Yes. I mean, when you think about it, I mean, we've got two classes of insects. We've got root worms and caterpillars. The root worms are more influenced by the moisture levels in the spring. And caterpillars, the flights come in often from Mexico, so temperatures in the Midwest really have no impact on what the likely patterns will be. Brett, I know you're closer to what's going on from Roundup pricing, so I'll let you follow-up with that second part.","Hugh Grant","Relocation of plants in China and environmental controls, Brett?","Brett Begemann","Yes, I think, Jeff, thanks for the question on that. I think your overarching statement is true. We definitely see China with a significantly higher emphasis on environmental and chemistry in general, and in particular, crop chemistry. So plants are closing. They're being relocated to industrial sites, et cetera, and that -- in those industrial sites, they're being required to put containment systems in place and treat the waste, et cetera. And that all drives a bit of cost, and as they do that, I think that's what we're seeing reflected in the asset prices coming out of China. And of course, as the generics come out of China, we're staying true to our strategy of pricing just over the generics coming out of China. That's what's allowed us to continue to raise our price, so I think a big piece of it is that, and as well as some cost of goods, and we think that some of the raw materials going in from China are also adding a bit to it. So it's beneficial for us from an overall pricing standpoint. And quite frankly, it's good for the industry to see China taking those bold steps around the environment.","Hugh Grant","Yes. We've been talking about it for years, but we've actually started doing it now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Maybe I'll direct one to Pierre. Pierre, is there a full year CapEx guidance? And your tax reform comments were a little bit vague. I think you expect to benefit beyond this year, which will allow for a really wide range for this year. What could make your tax rate as high as 30% this year?","Pierre Courduroux","So first, we're really pleased with the adoption of the tax reform legislation. And I mean, all the work we've done shows that it should result in a positive outcome starting in 2019. And obviously, the adoption of territorial system also has some benefits from a cash management perspective, so those are really important points. Regarding 2018, well, it's still early, and our teams are evaluating the different components of tax reform. Overall, as I mentioned, we're looking at an ETR, and we try to put a cap to what the ETR could be. That shouldn't be any worse than 30%, and the variation that we could be seeing, I mean, result from -- we're working on the valuation of our deferred tax positions, including offering tax credits and looking at those may have some significant impact on the final rate impact of the deemed repatriation tax, and all of those are related.","And obviously, the rate reduction on the U.S. income, so we wanted to give some kind of guidance at this point in time to help you think about it. And some of the data, you can find in our 10-K should also help you regarding the tax rate, but that's where we are overall. As I mentioned, we try to put a cap on what the effective tax rates could be in 2018, knowing that it could be materially lower than that.","John Roberts","Okay. And CapEx?","Pierre Courduroux","Have we given guidance regarding CapEx? I mean, we have -- we've had a flow of CapEx over the last couple of years, and from a directional perspective, I think that's a good way to think about it, knowing that we are implementing the building of our plant in Luling regarding dicamba facility.","Operator","Our final question for today will come from the line of Tony Jones with Redburn.","Tony Jones","I wanted to ask about the pipeline. So firstly, on corn, you've got Trecepta moving to launch. What's the expected price premium once you get market ramp-up? And then just I also wanted to check on Acceleron, this new 360 product moving to Phase 4. I think, Robb, you talked about second trials coming in the next couple of quarters, but could you give us an indication of what the yield enhancement is from the first round of trials?","Robert Fraley","So on the BioAg Alliance products, we've advanced several of the new microbial products. We're particularly excited about the BioYield 2, which will become Acceleron 360 once we get the final regulatory approvals. The key active ingredient here is an LCO molecule, a lipochito-oligosaccharide, which stimulates root growth and nutrient uptake. And so in our testing in corn, we've seen 4 to 7 bushels per acre yield increases with the technology. And we expect on most of the acres, it will be combined with our B-300 product. So this will be a situation where we'll have multiple microbial products on the seed treatment for corn. In terms of your question on Trecepta on pricing, first of all, the Trecepta product will be targeted for those extreme areas with high levels of caterpillar pressure, particularly army worm and others, typically in the Southern U.S. corn production belt. And what's exciting is not only are we launching Trecepta this year, but based on the advancement of new insect control leads, we already have the next two generations of products advancing in the pipeline. And that's going to ensure that growers in both North and South America have a continuity of products that are effective, both for caterpillar control and for resistance management.","Hugh Grant","Thank you for the question. So we'll respect your time this morning. In conclusion, as we close out today, I'm sure it's clear to all of you that the months ahead will be pivotal for Monsanto. And as a team, we're clearly focused on driving the deal to completion and staying focused on delivering our year. So on behalf of my team and myself, thanks for the continued support of Monsanto, and thanks again for joining us on the call this morning, and all the very best to you and your family in the New Year. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr. Hurley. You may begin.","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Rob. And good morning to everyone on the line. Thanks for joining Monsanto's second quarter earnings conference call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; and Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me are Manny Cruz and Bryan Corkal, my colleagues in Investor Relations. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address. ","We're providing you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are posted to our website.","This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.","Today's conference call revolves around the results that confirm the momentum in our U.S. business in the second quarter and the step-up those results create for Monsanto's full year earnings and free cash flow outlook, as we've raised our guidance above the high end of our initial ranges for each. Given that, I'll let Pierre walk you through our financial results to give you the context of our strong 2012. Then Hugh will take a deeper look at where we stand in our overall strategy and how we see the layers of growth building from where we are today.","Pierre Courduroux","Thanks, Bryan. And good morning to everybody on the line. The second quarter was a record quarter for Monsanto. But more importantly, it provides the evidence of our business strength and creates the confidence we have in our full year performance as we increase our guidance expectations. So today, I will build by review around the step-up in our full year earnings and free cash guidance on Slide 4. ","We raised our ongoing EPS expectations above the high end of our initial guidance to $3.49 to $3.54 per share. We also raised our free cash outlook to $1.6 billion to $1.8 million, also above the high end of our initial range. This is a significant step-up that confirms that the momentum we saw in the business has translated into financial results. ","And before I go through the details, let me emphasize a couple of points. First, the completion of this quarter gives us the data points to confirm the strength we anticipated in our U.S. business. During this quarter, we've seen the translation of early indicators, like the strong order book and deferred revenues, into our financials. Second, with a record second quarter, we have an early punctuation mark on what we see as a great year. The strong showing in the U.S. builds nicely on the growth from our Latin American business. In just 2 quarters, it's clear we're delivering on our expectations of greater international growth, more balance across our businesses and continued expansion of our U.S. base. In fact, with the strong U.S. performance, we now see the U.S. becoming the largest contributor to our overall growth for the year. But it is nicely complemented by the strong and expected growth from our international business. Most importantly, if you take all of that together, we now expect to deliver ongoing earnings growth in the range of the high-teens this year, and that speaks to the great overall year we see in 2012.","If we now go to Slide 5, I will walk you through our financial results and give you the context for our increased guidance. For the quarter, ongoing earnings per share were $2.28 compared with $1.87 in prior year, an increase of more than 20%. That performance makes this second quarter a record in terms of ongoing EPS, as well as total sales and gross profit in our important Seeds and Genomics segment. That record quarter means that the second quarter will be our most significant earnings driver this year, and in turn, it changes the seasonality of our earnings flow in 2012. Given the combination of the absolute growth in our business, the early strong demand in the U.S. and a couple of timing benefits, the first half results largely capture the growth we expect to reach in our full year guidance. This has a practical effect on our full year earnings pattern as the stronger first half performance and timing shift also means that we expect overall earnings for the second half of the year to be effectively flat when compared with last year.","And the best way to see how all of that plays into our increased full year guidance is to build off the business drivers and key factors in our first half performance. This -- the clear place to start from it, clearly Seeds and Genomics. In this critical quarter for the U.S. and for our seeds business, Seeds and Genomics gross profit grew by approximately 17%. Year-to-date, Seeds and Genomics gross profit is also up by double digits, reaffirming it as the central driver of our growth in 2012.","The biggest driver of that growth is our corn business, where gross profit is up by more than 20% in the quarter. With the second quarter driven by the U.S., we are very happy with the strength that we see in our North American corn business this year. Our growth strategy is on track and delivering. and Hugh will spend a little more time with the specific milestones here. If you combine that U.S. strength with the step-up we saw in Latin America, our corn seeds and traits gross profit is up 29% year-to-date. And we've also seen the margin expansion we expected in corn, with the improvement of 3 points at this point in the year reflecting the financial benefit we get as the strategy to upgrade our mix and provide greater value on each acre is realized. Corn is clearly a core driver for us, both this year and in future years. So the validation of our strategy for earnings underscores the ongoing opportunity we see.","Now this performance also reflects the practical reality that there's been strong acreage growth in nearly all the key corn geographies this year. This is not the critical factor in our earnings in any year, but that acreage growth provides a tailwind that we were all well positioned to capture and translate to financial results.","In addition to our strong corn results in the quarter, we see continued positive gross profit contributions from our cotton and soybean businesses. For the quarter, soybeans are the most meaningful contributor of the 2 as the financials start to reflect the contribution from the U.S. season. And the first half uptick is really a function of the positive mix effect occurring as we step up to our Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform in the U.S. This is another important strategy driver Hugh will cover. But from a mix standpoint, our U.S. soybean contribution is squarely where we want it to be. ","As we told you coming into the year, our Brazilian soybean business had a record year in 2011 because of the historically high revenue from our point-of-delivery royalty system, which reflected the strong yields and healthy commodity prices we saw last year. We don't expect those conditions to repeat in 2012, so the overall contribution from Brazil soybeans will be smaller this year, which will also be reflected in the second half. As we've indicated, as the Brazil contribution normalizes, we expect total soybean GP to be flat to slightly down year-over-year and for margins to pull back from those 2011 levels.","The strong first half in corn, soybeans and cotton was partly offset by our vegetable business, where the second quarter continued the trend we saw in the first quarter. And there's really 2 factors at play. One relates to the market conditions in Europe and the other is the result of an operational decision. We've seen reduced sales in the EU, where economic conditions reduced demand for our higher-end vegetables and have limited customers' access to credit. We've also completed an extensive review of our vegetable portfolio, writing off some of our existing inventory, which we believe will also help enable our vegetable growth strategy as we move to fresher inventory over time. ","With all of that, we expect the first half loss to moderate in the second half and total vegetable GP to be down some for the full year but transitioning back to growth in 2013. Vegetables continue to be one of our core crop platforms and a source of growth in the coming years. In fact, on the technology side, we're advancing more products into launch preparation than we have seen since we got into the vegetable business. And this validates the commercial opportunity we see from new products coming from our molecular breeding pipeline.","The last point to make regarding our first half business performance relates to a couple of timing elements that mostly impact the U.S. and result in earnings flowing through the income statement earlier than in some prior years. Most notably, with the warm winter and strong demand for our products, things are set up to translate to an earlier-than-typical spring. For us, it means that with mild weather around our warehouses, we've been able to ship more seeds than last year. ","Additionally, we have some first half timing benefits coming from our licensing business. As in our branded business, we see the benefit from the earlier spring as licensee volume is also shipping earlier in the season. In addition, over the past couple of years, we've gotten better visibility on in-season forecasts for licensee sales. So taken together, those 2 factors mean that compared with prior years, more of the annual royalty revenue has shifted from the second half of the year into the first half.","When I bring all those elements together, it underscores the underlying growth that drove our first half results. The combination of growth in our core business in the U.S. and internationally, our ability to take advantage of the momentum afforded by our strategy and the practical realization of some benefits -- all of that positions us very well for 2012.","It also provides the context for how we see these results translating to the step-up in our full year guidance on Slide 6. As you would expect, based on the first half results, the step-up in our ongoing EPS guidance flows directly from our Seeds and Genomics segment. Entering the year, our target range for Seeds and Genomics gross profit positioned us to grow approximately $500 million over last year. Through the first half of the year, our growth is effectively in that range. So as we step up our ongoing EPS guidance, we've also made a step-up in our gross profit expectations for Seeds and Genomics, which we now project to be higher, in a range between $5.85 billion and $5.9 billion. ","The next category to look at is ag productivity. I didn't spend any time on ag productivity in the financial review, but it continues to track close to our initial expectations, delivering gross profit of $394 million through the first half. The biggest driver in that performance comes from the Roundup business. Building on the success we had with the weed management strategy in 2011, Roundup is in a good position this fiscal year. Our prices continue at a small premium to the generics, and we are seeing strong volume and the mix benefit with more branded Roundup this year. With that Roundup strategy working well and with contribution from our selective and lawn-and-garden businesses, we are tracking toward a slight upside to our initial guidance for the segment and expect to generate between $800 million and $825 million in total GP for the segment for the full year.","Moving below the line. Our expenses to date are largely tracking with the increases we'd expect as we grow the business. We continue to expect to be in the guidance range we laid out for SG&A and R&D spending. Although with a step-up in our business results, we'd expect to likely land at the higher end of our ranges for the full year.","Let me now wrap up with the other aspect of our increased guidance, which is the increase in our free cash flow outlook to $1.6 million to $1.8 billion. As you'd expect, the stronger business results are translating from earnings into cash, but we are also seeing the benefit of a strong ag environment via our collections, as well as the continued benefit from our working capital management. For the first half of the year, we have generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion, which is a step-up of $353 million from the $917 million we generated in the first half of 2011. ","Converting earnings into cash remains a priority, and I'm very pleased with our performance this year. This creates the means to invest in the business for growth, and Hugh will mention some of the areas we're looking to emphasize. It also allows us to prioritize the value we can return to shareowners. In this quarter, we've used $273 million for share buybacks, which now puts us more than 80% through our $1-billion share buyback program. And for the first half of the year, we've used a total of $621 million on dividends and share buybacks, or almost 40% of our new projected full year free cash flow that we directly returned to owners.","Let me conclude by stepping back from the numbers for the moment, and I'll make 2 key points. First, when you deliver a record quarter like our second quarter, the momentum and the strength in the business becomes apparent. At the beginning of the year, we said our business was going to be more balanced and include more growth from global areas that complement expansion in the U.S. With the Latin American results and the confirmation in the U.S., we've seen all of that in just 2 quarters and that is driving the growth we expected in 2012. Second, the second quarter is an early punctuation mark on a great year financially. Our business strategy is strong, and most importantly, we are translating that to financial results. And that's why we feel confident in stepping up our full year guidance, as we expect ongoing earnings growth in 2012 in the range of the high-teens, confirming for us even at this relatively early point that 2012 should be another strong year. ","With that, let me turn the time over to Hugh for the look at our strategy at this point.","Hugh Grant","Thank you, Pierre. And good morning to everybody joining us on the call. We've talked about momentum for some time. With the results of our core U.S. business in hand, I think we can say that momentum was more than a 1-year uptick in 2011, and it really reflects the cadence of sustained opportunity and growth, both in the U.S. and internationally. ","I'd make 3 points. Number one, this momentum is important. We're getting to the outlook for 2013 in the third quarter, so I won't get ahead of that today. But last year was a very good year for our business, and we see that strength continuing in 2012. With back-to-back solid years, our strategy is on track, and that allows us to look into 2013 with more confidence. ","Number two, we see layers of growth. It used to be easy to identify us with a single product and a single geography. But as our business expands, we see multiple layers of growth over multiple areas and coming in over multiple time periods. That's important because we'll build on our existing momentum as we grow into a more global, balanced business. That also means that we don't just rise and fall with the cycles but we have growth opportunity that's rooted in real strategic drivers. ","And finally, number three, within those layers, there are entirely new categories of opportunity that enable growth. We're consciously leveraging our unique R&D and commercial advantages in totally new areas where we can build new platforms. The second quarter is an ideal point to measure our progress against those layers of growth. It's a data-rich period where we see some of the key indicators of the strategy playing out.","So the place to begin is the U.S. on Slide 7. On a macro level, U.S. agriculture definitely reflects the strong demand-driven opportunity. And as we calibrate our business success against that environment, it's very clear that the U.S. is delivering again this year. The proof is in our U.S. volume and mix. We took a huge step forward last year, and I'm pleased to say that, that's continuing in 2012. We're seeing significant volume growth and a step change in the mix upgrades. Just as importantly, coming out of the 2011 harvest, we saw some of our strongest yield advantages ever. So I'm pleased that those differential advantages on last year's yield monitors are translating to greater opportunity this year. I'm also particularly gratified to see the validation of a couple of years of heavy lifting, as we made the conscious effort to address product choices and pricing to better connect with our farmer customers. ","With the translation of orders to shipments, we see a significant step-up in unit volume growth. Specifically, we're on track for an increase in total U.S. branded seed volume. And if we focus further on cotton seed, the trend that we set last year is continuing. In 2011, our branded cotton volume grew by the largest increment in the last 3 years, and that translated to organic share growth. We're building on that success in 2012 as we project another significant step-up in cotton unit volume. And while the ultimate planted acres are still speculative at this point, we're confident on our volume growth in cotton is strong and we expect it to translate to organic share growth again. In particular, in a year where cotton seed supply has been in focus, with the majority of shipments already out and our seed effectively back from South American production, we continue to be in a good position with our seed availability to meet the overall market opportunity. ","The other measure is mix on Slide 8. We now have the sales on hand to give us confidence that we'll see step-ups of more than 10 million additional acres again this year, in both our Reduced Refuge Family in corn and Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield in soybeans. 2011 was a breakout year for both of these platforms, and the ability to step that up once again in 2012 speaks to how far these platforms have come and how well they've shown up at harvest time. In fact, with the strength in the U.S. corn market, we expect to be at the high end of our 22 million to 24 million acre target in the Reduced Refuge corn family. This certainly reflects the good response to the rollout and the ramp-up of RIB Complete for Genuity SmartStax and VT Double PRO this year.","Within that, the demand for our rootworm traits in particular has been strong this year. As I mentioned in the first quarter, we take issues of rootworm hotspots in the corn and cotton areas seriously, and we've worked to be proactive in this area. It's an environment where we should expect the noise around rootworm hotspots to continue to make headlines. I also believe that farmers see the practical benefits. That's evidenced by the strong sales this year, but also shows up in the demand beyond 2012 as we step up the weight of SmartStax and Triple PRO in our portfolio with the growth of our Reduced Refuge Family. ","Similarly, the widely recognized performance of Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans has really spurred strong demand. In 2011, Roundup Ready 2 Yield sales capitalized on the harvest buzz around its strong yield performance. With back-to-back solid harvest results, that same trend continues in 2012. We expect to step up at least an additional 10 million acres this year, as we're on track for our 27-million to 30-million-acre target even though total planted soybean acres are likely to be a little lower than last year. Strategically, Roundup Ready 2 Yield represents more than 3\/4 of our branded offering this year, so the conversion is really in full swing.","That trait upgrade complements the mix benefit that we're seeing in our germplasm portfolios as well. We're well on track to see the annual portfolio upgrade of our corn germplasm, which also means that we're tracking very well against the portfolio price mix expectations that we had entering the season. With an annual upgrade and a massive market like the U.S., there's a built-in increment of growth that comes as better breeding drives better yield performance and new higher-value seeds for farmers.","Additionally, I recognize the intensity of annual interest in the ultimate mix of planted acres this year, especially in light of last week's USDA report. In the U.S., because of the balance in our business, there's only a minimal earnings difference as acres move between crops as shown on Slide 9. Given what we shipped and our overall mix, I'm comfortable that however the planted acres land, we'll have overall growth across our U.S. business.","Before we leave the U.S., I'll make one final point of punctuation. With the success that we had in 2011 and the strong first half in 2012, the U.S. continues to be a big opportunity for us as one where each and every one of our growth factors is playing out. You have the mix upgrades in traits and germplasm, you see continuing volume growth and you see pipeline products expected to build further from here. It's a compelling opportunity that we see holding growth potential for the rest of this decade.","As we move on to additional layers, we've described 2012 as a year where we're going to see growth from our international businesses. There's no better example of that than the emergence of the corn opportunity in Latin America, shown on Slide 10. This Latin American story was the centerpiece of our results in Q1, so I won't belabor the point. But since it's such an important strategic driver, I'd emphasize 2 points:","First, in the broad view, we're only on the front edge of trait penetration in Latin America. In Brazil, our growth this year was primarily driven on just initial trait penetration and the first upgrade from first- to second-generation traits. We still have the opportunity of the full upgrade to double stacks and other multi-trait stacks. So for traits alone, we expect that this is a runway that carries out over the next half a decade. ","Second, if you layer that trait penetration with the same germplasm portfolio upgrade that I described in the U.S., then we're seeing the compounding effect of trait penetration, volume growth and pricing upgrades. In fact, in places like Brazil, with the rapid upgrades underway, the portfolio turnover rate is currently exceeding that of the U.S., which we show on Slide 11. Those are incremental upgrades happening every year that aren't as flashy as a new trait introduction, but ultimately prove to be as valuable as a growth engine.","The next layer of growth expands the South American opportunity beyond corn. On Slide 12, we see the launch of Intacta later this year as a single product that's a game-changer for Brazilian soybean farmers. It's the first insect-protected herbicide-tolerant stack for soybeans. Pierre and I just returned from a trip to Brazil for an event with some of the 500 farmers who took part in our Ground Breakers program this year. These farmers have just completed the ultimate product test drive, and you can't miss their enthusiasm. We shared with them the very early yield results that we're compiling out of this year's program. In this early data, we're seeing the step change in performance that we expected, with initial yield benefits of more than 4 bushels an acre compared with first-generation Roundup Ready.","From here, we'll use this Ground Breakers data to make the key commercial decisions for next year, like pricing and variety availability. That keeps us on track for a launch in Brazil's summer season. Our emphasis is on translating this positive start into a successful first commercial year and we'll step up availability slowly in 2013. So it won't be a big earnings driver in fiscal '13, but it's clearly a major component of growth that starts ramping up now.","This concept of layers plays to our strengths, which you can see on Slide 13, and the lower right quadrant reflects one really new critical point. These are whole new growth initiatives that we're focused on. Here's how I think about these. These are areas that we think can become growth platforms, taking a strategic spot in our business right alongside something as big and as impactful as breeding and biotech. In the near-term, we're investing for success in each area, so these are R&D and commercial priorities with real dollars behind them. There's a rich strategy behind each, but I'll do just a quick run through to give you a cumulative sense of why these platforms matter.","If you start with geographic expansion on Slide 14, to me, our breeding engine is actually the biggest blockbuster in our pipeline. This is an engine that allows us to upgrade a significant portion of our product portfolio across crops and across our most important geographies every year. And that creates compelling annual value that we can take to our customers.","The first place that you can see this playing out is Eastern Europe, shown on Slide 15. There are about as many acres in Eastern Europe as there are in Brazil, and the current yields there are relatively low. Since our U.S. germplasm actually fits the geographic area well, we can fast-track our breeding efforts to getting very near-term growth. ","That same idea fits China, shown on Slide 16. The opportunity in China fits the pattern of the other major corn areas that we've seen ramping up over the last decade. It's the second-largest corn market, so the opportunity is big. Improving productivity is going to take time, technology and investment, but we're confident that we have technology in hand, like our breeding capability, that can create new value. And we're in a perfect position to scale up for this opportunity. Since 2001, with the joint venture with Sinochem, who's the largest local distributor of ag inputs and runs China National Seed, that gives us a strong local partner as we look to expand our joint venture to reach this emerging opportunity. ","If China and Eastern Europe are about leveraging current capability, the best example of delivering another set of new technology to drive yield is Integrated Farming Systems, or IFS, shown on Slide 17. Robb talked extensively about IFS in his January pipeline update. The idea of precision agriculture isn't new, but the ability to connect Monsanto's vast amounts of seed data to specific on-farm recommendations is new. That creates a big opportunity to connect data and yield. So we're investing in R&D and the core capabilities to scale this up for farmers in the near-term.","You also can't have a conversation about new opportunities without talking about our R&D pipeline, shown on Slide 18. Practically, we simply have more platforms from which to grow than anybody else, and the benefit becomes apparent on this slide. As you'll see with these various platforms, we basically have the potential to launch a major innovation that steps up yield effectively for every year in this decade. As we're able to scale up new approaches like IFS, our breeding capabilities, our RNA technology, I expect that we'll be adding even more growth platforms in this space.","So as I wrap up, I want to bring these layers of growth together with the strategic checkpoint that is our second quarter. And here's how I think about that. First, we delivered a record second quarter. That's important because it becomes the proof point of the strength of our U.S. business and the confirmation that creates the confidence that we now have in delivering ongoing earnings growth in the high-teens for 2012. Second, if you pair this half with the great year that we had in 2011, you see the back-to-back performance that says we believe that we have our momentum back. And finally, that momentum doesn't stop here. Two years of solid business performance underscores our conviction and allows us to look into 2013 with confidence and with renewed energy around our core strategies. ","So thanks again for joining us. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bryan for the Q&A section. Bryan?","Bryan Hurley","Thanks, Hugh. We'd now like to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Rob, with that, I think we're ready to take questions from the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe I could just ask for a little incremental detail about how you're thinking about sort of the pull-forward of deliveries from 3Q into 2Q versus just total acreage being up. And maybe within speaking to that, you could sort of remind us how many acres of corn and soy were in your original guidance and then how many acres are in it now.","Hugh Grant","So a couple of questions in there. It's an earlier season, and we've seen some benefit on timing as a result of that. So earlier, Pierre mentioned trucking from warehouses. So earlier trucking, earlier deliveries. But all that notwithstanding, we think we've sold more bags of seeds and we'll see share growth as a result of that. So it's nice to have the wind at your back, but we've seen organic growth as well. If you look at the crops -- and then I'll maybe ask Pierre for a bit more color on it. If you look at the crops, we have higher visibility in corn than we do in soy and cotton. It's just a little bit earlier for corn. At 96 million acres, we would forecast that we will still grow share, so isn't the denominator and numerator game. In soybeans, ironically, there's a likelihood that the soy crop will be smaller. So it's even -- it's possible to sell less and grow share in a smaller crop. But the key thing for us in soybeans is Roundup Ready 2 Yield and the fact that it's now 75% of our mix in soybeans. That's the real headline. And then in cotton, I would say too early to call. A lot of the production acres in cotton are coming out of Texas. And it's still been extraordinarily dry down there, so I think cotton will be the last card to turn. But maybe, Pierre, a few more words on mix effect?","Pierre Courduroux","Yes. So, Vincent, to come back maybe specifically to your question around how much is timing and how much is real growth. So if you just step back and look at our guidance, so right now, we are looking at the top end of our guidance, almost 20% growth year-to-year, which I think is an important factor. And definitely corn, because I think your question was targeted at corn, corn is going to be a major driver in this growth and in us being able, feeling good about raising guidance at this early point in the season. However, as Hugh was mentioning, there's still doubt around the acres. And this is why -- I mean, at this point in time, you can still see 2 million, 3 million acres moving late in the season with less days of planting in between soy and corn. And this is why we want to be prudent in the way we talk about it. Overall, within the range of outcomes we are planning to work with at this point in time, we feel very comfortable -- comfortable enough to raise guidance at this point in time. Now how much of the great quarter is linked to timing? How much is linked to the actual performance in our business? It's very difficult to measure at this point in time. We know we are doing very well, but we also know there's an element of timing. And at this point in time, we feel comfortable within the ranges of outcomes we are working with that we could raise our guidance at this point in time. So that's kind of the way we're looking at it at this very early point in time.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Then just as a follow-up, because I just want to clarify, I don't think or it doesn't sound like your guidance includes 96 million acres of corn planted in the U.S. and it doesn't -- my guess would be that your original guidance was probably more like flat acres year-over-year. Am I far off on those?","Pierre Courduroux","We've always been looking early on at a 92 million to 94 million acres in our working assumptions. And at this point in time, to be perfectly honest, we were a little surprised with the USDA number at the high side of what we were expecting. So once again, ranges of outcomes, we can see the market 96 million. If the market was at 96 million, we don't expect soybeans to be very strong. So it's a matter of balance at this point in time. So when we look at the financial impact, we are trying to balance those 2 elements basically.","Hugh Grant","Just as a final, final point to Pierre's commentary, the USDA numbers at 96 million acres, there's a plus\/minus 3-million-acre error bar on that. And we here at Monsanto would say, to Pierre's point, the difference between 96 million and 94 million is planting conditions in the spring. So that last 1.5 million, 2 million acres really gets down to how open the spring is and what moisture availability is. So it's not going to be driven by demand. It's going to be the opportunistic nature of how open the season is, Vincent.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is James Sheehan sitting in for David. Just wondering if you can comment on -- you mentioned that you didn't think seed supply issues would be a problem for Monsanto this year. I could just -- if you could just comment on what you think the overall market impact might be and how your competitors are dealing with seed supplies in this environment.","Hugh Grant","It's always easier to talk about your own business than your competitors'. So for us, I can tell you that the lion's share of our winter production that's came up from South America is now back and is either on-farm being trucked or being processed. So we're very fortunate in that the South American season was also early. Soil conditions warmed up fast there and the crop came off early. So we've seen a pretty fast turnaround. We've still got a little bit to come back, but the lion's share is back. The stories from the countryside, there are some of the smaller dealers who had production -- either limited production or production all in one geographic area or were limited in what we sent south. There is a squeeze with some of those dealers right now, but we've been more focused on getting our own stuff back and getting it out to our grower customers. So we -- I guess, just to reiterate the point, we feel good about our supply situation and even -- just tying it to Vincent's question, even if there were 96 million acres planted, it's a stretch. Because even if there were, then with some diligence and some focus, we feel we could supply that piece of the market that we're chasing.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just in light of the success you've had in driving penetration thus far on traits, could you just comment on how you see the value capture model evolving in the next couple of years?","Hugh Grant","In North America or in general?","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","North America, please.","Hugh Grant","So I think value capture is a euphemism for price. And so we've -- our view on this, I think we've done very, very well on the last 2 years on delivering additional products. We've built 2 brand-new platforms, so building additional products to increase the choice for growers. The feedback -- as I've traveled, the feedback from growers has been very, very good. And from a pricing point of view, we've taken a much more conservative stance, and I would anticipate that, that will continue into the 2013 season. So we'll be looking for the leverage on delivering new technologies on spreads in our germplasm choice and really driving Reduced Refuge and driving our new soybean platform. But I don't think you're going to see large price hikes as we look into the '13 season.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You had tremendous revenue growth in the first and second quarters, but your deferred revenue's now at -- your deferred revenues are pretty flat or flat to down versus last year. Does that mean that revenues should flatten out in the second half?","Pierre Courduroux","Well, I mean, that's part of the early season we were talking about. So if you look at the balance sheet on a year-to-year basis, I mean, it's very comparable to where we were last year. And if you remember, when we closed the book in November, our deferred revenue were way higher. So this means we've been able to deliver very early this year and a lot. So from that perspective, I mean, this is very consistent with our view that the season is early and that we've been able to deliver very early and that this definitely has an impact on our sales. So we are definitely seeing obviously less growth in the second part of the year than we saw in the first part of the year as far as the deliveries are concerned in the U.S., definitely.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And your gross -- your incremental gross margin in corn was above 80%, which is pretty unusual. And you talked about there being various timing issues. What was the earnings per share benefit of the timing issues year-over-year in the quarter?","Pierre Courduroux","So as when we discussed with Vincent, I'm not sure we are able to quantify at this point in time how much was timing and how much was the increase in the business. But our assumption at this point in time, it's anywhere in between $0.05 and $0.10, I think, would be a reasonable number. But we'll wait for the third quarter to feel better about the accuracy of that number, because obviously we don't know yet.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask a little bit about the business activity through your licensees. On the soybean side, I think, Hugh, you said you had 3\/4 of your own product had gone to Roundup Ready 2. I guess, the math suggests that maybe 50% through your channel partners. Can you validate if that's about right and what you expect over the next couple of years both for the Asgrow and the licensee brands?","Hugh Grant","Yes. Bob, that would be about right, maybe a little bit higher than that. So we've -- if you think back 3 short years, you're rolling out these platforms. And those first few varieties in those first few acres are always exciting times. I feel really good about where we are today because overall penetration is high, our licensee sign-up is high and we're seeing the business tracking pretty much on -- exactly on track with where we forecast we would be.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then on Refuge-In-The-Bag, I think you suggested earlier that you'd have a pretty complete transition on your own brands to Refuge-In-The-Bag from Smart -- RIB Complete from SmartStax. Is that what happened so far? And what are you seeing in your licensees there? What kind of penetration have they made from SmartStax to RIB Complete?","Hugh Grant","Yes. On our own brands, we are delighted. So it's exactly on track from where we said we were going to be. The licensees, there's a little bit more variability. But the front end, the leading companies there would be -- frankly, they'd be at or in some cases ahead of where we are. So if you look at it as a composite, we're feeling very good. We're feeling very good with the transition and where we and our trade customers are.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of related questions on pricing. What's your average pricing in the U.S? And specifically on RIB, what kind of price increase were you able to charge for the convenience of RIB?","Pierre Courduroux","So, P.J., at this point in time, obviously it's still fairly early, and we've not been through the whole assessment of our final numbers. But the way we look at it, we were talking about corn price increases in the range of 5% to 10% for the year. I mean, we are well within this range at this point in time and we feel pretty good about the reception from the farmers that are translating into volume. And when you look at our performance right now, I mean, 50% would be coming from volume and about 50% from price and mix. So very, very well on track with our plan of the 5% to 10% increases in corn prices we were looking at.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then secondly, on Integrated Farming System or IFS, when it's rolled out, how do you charge for that? Do you charge a consulting fee? Or is there -- would you have the same profit-sharing model on that? And isn't that sort of conflict with what the retailer is supposed to do?","Hugh Grant","I see the retailer as a partner in this, P.J. And we've been talking to our customers about that. So however we roll out IFS, our retail partners in the trade will be -- they're on-farm; they're walking fields. They'll be a part of that prescription. And they're excited and interested. Now how you charge, we're still working on. But the principle, I would look at this the same way you think about biotech trait. The first step for this is you need to create yield and create an incremental yield that the growers have never seen, then we're back to the usual conversation on how you share it. But I saw -- the straight answer is we don't know yet, but I'm encouraged with the work that we saw rolling through last year, our ability to build those prescriptions on a statistically relevant manner. We're gaining confidence in that area. And now I'll just double back, your question, Pierre's answer on RIB pricing. To me, the really interesting thing is, one, we are -- we've made the 100% transition in our own brands. So that's done. They're RIB Complete. Two, and I've sensed this for the last 3 years but it's really playing out in the order book, growers want this. And the grower demand, the farmer growers' confidence and interest level has risen. And they can cut through the technology and talk about what that brings them on their farm. So 2 or 3 years ago, this was a hypothetical. But you travel in the countryside now, they're there. They're talking about this in concrete terms.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions on margins. Near-term, how much of a drag was the inventory adjustment in vegetables? And longer-term, as you're rolling out more of these platforms, are you going to see a stable relationship between SG&A and sales? Or are you going to see every now and then a step-up due to greater complexity of this integration of agronomy into your product offering?","Hugh Grant","I'll maybe ask Pierre to talk about margins. I'll say a quick word on SG&A.","Pierre Courduroux","Okay. So I mean, very specifically, regarding your question and the impact of the inventory corrections on margins, when you look at the veggie downside, we have -- 50% of that is coming roughly, and it's not an exact number, but about 50% is coming from the inventory write-offs and 50% is coming from the business in Europe basically.","Hugh Grant","And then on SG&A, the world's a big place, and I don't think the cookie-cutter works terribly well in our established markets like the U.S., as we continue to drive new technologies and expand the technology offering. As revenue grows, you dilute out SG&A. So I don't -- we are built out and we have the capacity to handle those launches without large increments or bubbles on SG&A. In some of the other markets around the world, and we talked about this in the first quarter, we will make strategic reinvestments and we're making reallocation of SG&A as well. And a great example of that is the Intacta launch in Brazil, where we resourced ahead of that launch. And that took incremental sales dollars and incremental marketing dollars. But we might see some of that in Eastern Europe as well as we build out that platform. But the return on our SG&A investment is so healthy that they're well worthwhile endeavors. But us, I don't think that you see SG&A continuing to ramp at the same rate as sales.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Hugh, you talked about the layers of growth in the U.S. Were your regional sales very different from last year? And my second question is on the corn margins. I assume that most of the strong margin you got was on price mix. But what actually happened to the seed production cost and your total cost in seed?","Hugh Grant","Yes. So I'll leave Pierre to talk about production costs. On regional growth, we -- I think we were up across-the-board in our branded business. So we saw a nice performance. We grew largely independently of regional effects. I mean, there's -- I'd rather talk about it in the third quarter when the dust has settled, but we haven't put any seed in the ground yet. But if you look at just general trend lines, we've seen nice growth across-the-board. And then on the cost one, I think there's quite a bit of mythology out there on cost spikes. And, Pierre, we haven't really seen that, I guess.","Pierre Courduroux","No. Actually I mean, once again we are well within the range of assumptions we worked with when building our plans for 2013. I mean, we -- yes, we've been using winter production, but we use winter production every year, and we've not significantly increased winter production. And we've not been terribly affected by the storms last year. So basically our cost of productions are well within our planning assumptions. I mean, at this point in time, this is not a major issue for us. And obviously, I mean, every year, we've got ongoing cost-improvement programs that also help improve our position. So when you look at the 3-point margin improvement that we are seeing in corn at this point in time in the year, I mean, it reflects the fact that our cost has not gone out of control. I mean, we feel pretty good about where we are at this point in time.","Hugh Grant","That's a good point. It didn't passively occur. We've been working pretty hard at that. And we've been very pleased and very fortunate with the crop that's came back from winter nursery. So that's always helpful.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Picken of Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Just a follow-up on sort of the seed supply issue. I was wondering if you could talk about where you see sort of your inventories being at the end of this year. And do you think there's enough seed if there becomes an issue where the farmers have to replant for this year? And then if you have any idea of what your plans are to increase seed production for next year, that would be helpful.","Hugh Grant","So thanks for the question. I don't really know how to answer it. But my -- our expectation would be that inventories will be low. But that's a function of whether 96 million acres is planted or not. So you get into that circular argument. I would say, in general, based on what we're looking at and the earliness of the season, even up to 96 million acres, given the inventory we have on hand, we will be able to supply our portion of that market. As always, growers towards the end of that might not get their first choice, but they will get a comparable second choice. And that's how our sales team has trained, and that's what we're trying to do to satisfy our grower customers. And I would guess that if the spring plays out on that kind of \"half normal albeit early\" way, then the industry is going to be low on inventory and that production will be ramped for next year. But frankly at this stage, we're still trucking and we're getting ready for the next few weeks when planting really gets underway. But thanks for your question.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Hugh, a question on soy pricing, actually 2 parts. One, based on the Intacta slide you showed, with 4 bushels an acre and some insecticide savings, that would seem to be roughly $50 of value per acre. Do you think you can get the 1\/3-2\/3 sharing in South America that you've historically targeted in North America? And then secondly, on U.S. soy pricing, you've had a positive experience in Canada this year post Roundup Ready 1 patent expiration because your competitor patented germplasm, so there's not seed saving. Do you think that, that gives you more flexibility on Roundup Ready 2 pricing in the U.S. ahead of the Roundup Ready 1 patent expiration in late '14?","Hugh Grant","Yes, thanks for the 2 questions, Don. So Intacta, it's at least $50. So we're creating a great deal of value. We are literally in the front end of this. So we -- as I mentioned in my remarks, Pierre and I were down there last week. We had about 130, 140 of the 500 growers together, and it was a great chance to talk to them. So we are in Phase 1. And Phase 1 of this Ground Breaker program is the consolidation of the data, the re-presentation of that data to the 500 and really getting to understand the benefits that we deliver on-farm. My message to them was -- my message to them was we will share and we'll share generously, but we never got down to the 1\/3-2\/3 split. We're in that discussion right now. The good news is we're creating a ton of value and it's recognized when you meet those growers directly. In the U.S., your question -- so I'm very optimistic. I'm very pleased with what's happening in Brazil. In the U.S., when you do the juxtaposition of what's happening in Canada, I'd say our focus is it's 75% of our mix. We need to finish that conversion. And with the varieties that we've got in hand, the buzz that's been created with performance in the new varieties, I'd say, number one, it's getting that conversion complete. And I'm delighted with the pace that we're seeing. Number two, it's preparing the way for Ground Breakers with dicamba. And there's a tremendous amount of interest there. And again, and I kind of answered this question earlier on corn, on pricing we'll price to the value that we're creating, but this is going to be a step-wise -- pricing for us will be a step-wise process, and we'll be more aggressive on chasing those final conversion acres and demonstrating the value of the technology than getting ahead of our SKUs on pricing. And I think particularly with the feedback that I'm getting on dicamba, I wish it was here tomorrow morning. There's a lot of interest around that stacked product in the U.S. as well. So U.S. and Brazil, different markets, different stages. But we couldn't have wished for a better year with these 2 -- the early platform moves.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Cox of Piper Jaffray.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just one quick question on the volume growth you described in the Reduced Refuge Family of at least 10 million acres. Could you talk about how important the SmartStax RIB Complete is in that year-over-year growth?","Hugh Grant","It's significant. As you know, we've never broke out the individual components of the family from a competitive point of view. Or we stopped doing that because we were providing such a road map. But we're pleased with the contribution that it's made, but it's -- frankly, the grower thinks much more about yield, about the choice relative to the yield potential on that on his farm. And the feedback has been -- the introduction of Double PRO and creating that extra rung on the ladder, feedback has been very, very strong. So it was a nice addition to the RIB family. So we -- at Monsanto, we tend to think about it more as a Reduced Refuge Family than focusing on the individual product performance of SmartStax. And that was a strategic shift 2 years ago, and it's played out very well for us.","So with that, perhaps I'll just make my -- I'm conscious of your time. Let me just wrap up. This has been a busy session for us. So I'd make 3 points, I guess, in closing. Number one, this -- as Pierre said, this was a record second quarter for Monsanto. And I think that's important because it becomes the proof point of the strength of our U.S. business that we've discussed in the call today, and it's the confirmation that creates the confidence that we now have in delivering ongoing earnings growth in the high-teens to 20% for 2012. Secondly, if you pair the strong first half with the really great year that we had in 2011, you see back-to-back performance that says we believe we have our momentum back. And finally, that momentum doesn't stop here because I think 2 years of solid business performance really underscores our conviction, and it allows us to look into the 2013 season with confidence and the renewed energy around our core set of strategies.","So I wanted to thank you again for joining us this morning. And I'll hand the call back to -- and I'll hand the call back to Bryan. Thank you very much.","Bryan Hurley","That's good. So with that, I think that, that would conclude our call, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation."]}}
