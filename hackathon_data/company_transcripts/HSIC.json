[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Susan Vassallo, Henry Schein's Vice President of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Susan.","Susan Vassallo","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's first quarter results.

I ask that during the Q&A portion of today's call you please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up before returning to the queue. This will provide the opportunity for as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour we have allotted for this call. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Good morning and thank you, Susan. And thank you, everyone for joining us. Before I begin to discuss the quarter, let me just note that last night the Fortune rankings, Fortune 500 rankings were issued, and Henry Schein placed 303 in the 2012 Fortune 500 Ranking of America's Largest Corporations. We are very pleased by this recognition of our ability to record steady growth even during challenging economic times. Our steady growth in -- position on the ranking is reflective of the wonderful work that our team of over 15,000 Team Schein Members around the world has undertaken in the past 16 years as a public company. Today, we are also pleased to be reporting overall sales growth of 7.8%. This is the first quarter that we are presenting net sales results for our global customer-centric business units and each of our global Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services units reported growth in local currency in mid single digits or better. So I think with the new way in which we're reporting our sales with these new global verticals, it'll give our shareholders a far better ability to understand the performance of the company and align the sales reporting and the profitability reporting of the company with our strategic plan. ","Based on the strength of our first quarter financial results and our continued confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are increasing EPS guidance -- or our EPS guidance range for 2012. Reflecting this outlook, our Board of Directors recently voted to authorize the repurchase of up to additional $200 million shares of Henry Schein common stock. Earlier this year, as discussed during our last quarterly call, we are continuing to optimize our cost structure and improve profitability. We look forward to the future with more efficient organization; the organization will be far more focused and efficient at using our resources and in that context, even have a sharper global view of our customers and their evolving needs. ","In a moment, I'll provide some commentary on each of our business units. Again, thank you to our 15-plus-thousand team Schein members around the world who are producing outstanding results for our shareholders quarter-upon-quarter. But before I go into further details and provide commentary, let me ask Steve Paladino, our CFO, to provide commentary on the first quarter financial results.","Steven Paladino","Okay, thank you, Stan, and good morning to everyone. I am also very pleased to be reporting strong financial results for the first quarter of 2012. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2012 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $11.8 million pretax or $0.09 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our last quarterly conference call and Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release reconciles our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings and EPS from continuing operations. ","Turning to our financial performance. Our net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were $2.1 billion, reflecting a 7.8% increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. This consists of 8.4% growth in local currencies and a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales were up 7.8% and the acquisition growth was 0.6%. You can see the details of our sales growth that are contained also in Exhibit A in our earnings news release. ","Let me point out that the comparison to the prior year first quarter was favorably impacted because the first quarter of 2012 did not include the December holiday week, whereas that particular holiday week was included in the first quarter of 2011. So this made for a somewhat easier sales growth comparison in the first quarter of 2012. If we adjust for that sales growth for that impact, our worldwide internally generated sales growth for the first quarter was 5.6% in local currencies, and that compares to the 7.8% I just mentioned. This impact was favorable on a worldwide consolidated basis on all of our sales categories, except for Dental equipment. This is because the last calendar week of the year is an exceptionally strong week for Dental equipment sales. This strong week was included in Q1 of last year in our reported sales, but again not in Q1 of the current year. And practitioners often make equipment purchases during the last calendar week of the year to take advantage of various tax incentives as well as other factors. This impact was primarily exhibited in our North American Dental equipment sales, and I will provide the specifics of this impact later on. We also believe that sales were somewhat favorably impacted by the overall mild winter weather this year. This factor had a positive impact in our Dental and Animal Health businesses due to increased patient traffic. However, we believe medical sales were adversely impacted by this mild weather as we saw a decline in sales of certain diagnostic consumable products for the quarter and I'll also talk about this impact later on. ","Our operating margin for the first quarter of 2012 is 6.4%, which is consistent with the first quarter of 2011. However, if we exclude restructuring costs, which we believe is the more appropriate measure, our adjusted operating margin for the first quarter of 2012 improved by 53 basis points to 6.9%. We are very pleased with the strong operating margin expansion for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3%, which is in line with our guidance and is down from the 32.5% in the first quarter of last year. We expect our effective tax rate to remain in this 32% range for the remainder of the year.","Net income attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2012 was $80.8 million or $0.89 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring costs, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $89.1 million or $0.98 per diluted share and this represents increase of 16.4% and 19.5%, respectively compared with the first quarter of 2011. ","I'd now like to provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. As Stan just mentioned, this is the first quarter we are presenting sales growth results for our global customer-centric -- customer-centric business units. So with global dental sales for the first quarter of 2012 increasing 5.5% to $1.2 billion and that consists of 6.6% growth in local currencies and a 1.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales were up 6.2%, while acquisition growth was 0.4%. The 6.2% growth in local currencies included 8.2% -- 8.2% growth in global consumable merchandise and a decline of 0.2% in global equipment. As I mentioned earlier, Dental consumable merchandise sales were favorably impacted by the inclusion of the year end holiday week in Q4 of last year, and we estimate that this -- that if we exclude this impact, our global Dental consumable merchandise sales increased by 4.7% rather than the reported 8.2%.","Internal sales growth in local currencies in our global Dental business is comprised of a 4.5% increase in our North American business and 8.9% internationally. I'll also discuss some detail behind each of these figures. The 4.5% internal growth in local currencies for North America included 7.1% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenues of 5.6%. However, as I just mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2011 included the last week of the calendar year, which is when a significant amount of dental equipment is installed due to various tax incentives. We believe this negatively impacted our Q1 equipment sales results, and if we exclude this impact, our North American Dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was up 1.5%, rather than the reported decline of 5.6%. ","Our 8.9% international internal growth in local currencies included 10% growth of Dental consumable merchandise and 6% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. We are obviously very pleased with our overall market share gains in the global dental market that we participate in.","Turning to our global Animal Health sales, they were $525.6 million in the first quarter. That's an increase of 15.3%, consisting of 15.4% growth in local currencies and a modest 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales were up 14.8% and acquisition growth was 0.6%. As I mentioned earlier, our global Animal Health sales growth was also favorably impacted by the inclusion -- by the exclusion, sorry, of the year end holiday week in -- from our Q1 2012 sales. If we exclude that impact, our local internal sales growth was a very healthy 9.7% rather than the 14.8% on an as-reported basis. We also believe that the Animal Health sales growth was favorably impacted by a generally mild winter weather, although this is difficult to quantify with any precision. ","Our 14.8% internal growth in local currencies included 15.8% in North America, as well as 13.7% international growth for our Animal Health group. Our North American Animal Health growth was largely fueled by strong flea & tick products sales, and again, we believe we continue to gain market share in this business unit also.","Turning to our global medical sales group. They had sales of $354.8 million in the first quarter. That's an increase of 4%, and consists of 4.2% growth in local currencies, offset by a 0.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales was up 3.6% and acquisition growth contributed 0.6% to our growth. If we look at the components of our 3.6% internal growth in local currencies, they were 3.4% growth in our North American business and 7.4% in our International business. We believe our medical sales were adversely impacted by a mild winter as we saw a significant decline in certain sales of diagnostic consumable products during the quarter, primarily in the North American market. Excluding this impact, our North American Medical sales growth in local currencies was 5.9% instead of the 3.4%. We believe there was also an impact related to lower sales of related products related to these diagnostic products, but again, that is also difficult to quantify with any precision. ","So again, despite the mild winter impact, we believe we also gained market share in the medical market.","Turning to the global technology and value-added services sales group. Our sales were $62.9 million in the first quarter, an increase of 13.1% and that's 13.2% growth in local currencies with a 0.1% decline related to foreign currency. Our local currency internally generated sales was up 9% and acquisition growth was 4.2%. The 9% internal growth in local currencies included 9.9% growth in North America and 4% international growth.","If we turn to stock repurchase, we continue to repurchase our common stock in the open market during the first quarter. More specifically, we repurchased approximately 544,000 shares of stock during the quarter, at an average price of $70.92 per share, or about $39 million. The impact of this repurchase on our first quarter results and EPS was not material. As Stanley mentioned, the Board has recently voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional $200 million of shares of Henry Schein stock in support of our goal of spending approximately $200 million to $300 million annually in the stock repurchase program to reduce slightly the number of average shares outstanding. If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $48.6 million and that compares to an operating cash flow of $48.5 million for the first quarter of 2011. The decline was primarily in working capital due to timing of cash receipts, which were very strong in Q4 of last year. ","We continue to believe that we will have a strong operating cash flow for the year, specifically our accounts receivable days outstanding were 40.1 days for the first quarter, down slightly from the 42.7 days in the first quarter of last year; and our inventory turns were 6.2 turns for the quarter, up slightly from the 6.1 turns in the first quarter of 2011. ","Let me now conclude my remarks by discussing our new 2012 financial guidance, which we announced this morning. We raised our 2012 diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, and that represents growth of 8% to 11% compared with the 2011 actual results. This new guidance compares with our previously issued guidance of $4.25 to $4.34. Let me also point out that for 2012, our fiscal year includes one less week than 2011. We also estimate restructuring costs for Q2 of 2012 to be approximately $2 million to $4 million on a pretax basis, or $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share, and all of our guidance excludes the restructuring cost in Q1 as well as Q2. Also, as always, our 2012 guidance is for the current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you very much, Steven. I'd like to review the first quarter results from our business units that served the Dental, Animal Health and Medical practices on a global basis, as well as providing some commentary on our Global Technology and Value-Added Services business units. These 4 business units provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each of our practitioner segments and are charged with implementing our 2012 to 2014 strategic plan, the plan that ends January -- December 31, 2014. And we do so with the benefits of a global perspective, strategy and operations, as well as global product and services offerings and global best practices. So let's take a look at the global Dental business first, which as Steven noted, was impacted by a number of factors relating to the holiday week of 2011, in fact, the way the calendar works and then the mild weather, which generally was favorable but did negatively impact our Medical business in the U.S. Suffice it to say though that apart from these impacts, we believe that we continue to gain market share in all of our business units. And as a further positive note, heading into the second quarter, I would like to mention that the North American Dental equipment backlog, as of now, was significantly higher than a year ago. So in understanding the business -- the performance of the business, I think it's very important to understand the impact of the calendar and some of the other variances and reasons for variances that Steven pointed out. ","We remain quite positive about the dental market in the United States. The traffic is -- seems to be stable to slightly growing. Consumables seem to be on the positive side and that looks to be holding, and equipment remains quite steady, of course, taking into account this anomaly at the year end. So now let's look at our global Animal Health business. ","This is a business that 5 years ago really was not significant to Henry Schein, although we've been in the Animal Health business for decades. The business continued to make very impressive gains in market share during the first quarter, due largely to expanding our breadth and depth of our product offering and to strengthening relationships with our customers on a global basis. Sales growth was favorably impacted by factors relating to the holiday week of 2011, just like in Dental, and the mild weather; obviously, with the mild weather, more patient visits. And we believe we continue to gain market share across the board, whether it's in the United States, in the companion animal arena, in Europe and Australia, New Zealand. ","About a month ago, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the veterinary distribution business of AUV Veterinary Services for a purchase price of approximately $38 million. That's U.S. dollars. We expect the transaction to close before the end of the second quarter. This business is the leading distributor serving Animal Health professionals in the Netherlands and Belgium, and does a great job of course, not only on the distribution side but providing terrific value-added services to the veterinarians of Belgium and the Netherlands. When this transaction closes later in the quarter, it will advance our Pan-European strategy of providing Animal Health practitioners across the continent with products and related services they need it in order to operate a more efficient practice and deliver high-quality care. Let me point out that the AUV veterinary business currently carries approximately 1% operating margin, and will negatively impact our consolidated worldwide operating margins going forward. Of course, this is nothing new in the history of Schein, and our goal is to provide better value-added services our customers and accordingly -- and improve the efficiency of the business and accordingly, generate greater operating margin and therefore better return on investments for our investors. ","So shareholders may recall this is exactly the same scenario as we had when we acquired the Demedis business in Germany and in many parts of Europe -- Western Europe several years ago and many other businesses. We look forward to the opportunity to, of course, improve on the terrific service that is already being offered to the Animal Health practitioners in the Benelux countries, and improve on the operating margin as AUV over the course of the next few years improves efficiencies and implements our Value-Added Services model. It's a terrific team and really very, very knowledgeable on the Animal Health arena, great overall and I think a team that is very happy to be housed with Henry Schein, a company that is committed, in fact, the only really global Animal Health distribution company. We estimate this acquisition will negatively impact operating margin for the second half of the year by approximately 10 basis points.","AUV veterinary services, as I noted, has tremendous reputation and a leader in the market it serves. Importantly it will be an excellent business and cultural fit with Henry Schein. AUV Services was founded in 1969 by 100 veterinarians. Today, it includes approximately 200 team members with headquarters and distribution centers in the Netherlands and another distribution center and a related headquarter in Belgium. AUV serves more than 2,000 large Animal Health veterinarians and their net sales for 2011 excluded -- exceeded $2.07 billion. Today, as I think our shareholders know, Henry Schein is the leading pan-European distributor of animal health products and services. We serve veterinary customers throughout Western Europe with operations in Australia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. And of course, our global Animal Health business also includes operations in the United States and Australia, New Zealand and a small operation in Hong Kong. With the addition of AUV, our annual global Animal Health sales will be well in excess of $2 billion. We are very pleased with the progress we are making in the development of our global Animal Health vertical. I think we have an outstanding team led here in the United States by Kevin Vasquez, and by Peter McCarthy in Europe, Nigel Nichols in Australia, New Zealand and with Lonnie Shoff as the head of the global vertical. Terrific leadership on the practice solution side in the software area; lots and lots of opportunity to work with our key suppliers in advancing their strategies, both on the product side and more importantly on the services side, using technology so very, very excited with this business. The business is in a process of taking Henry Schein's strategic plan and digging even deeper in regards to implementing their plan and developing the appropriate strategies and tactics, so very, very happy. ","So now let's take a look at the global Medical business. Just let me be sure to point out that the North American part of the Medical business comprises well over 90% of the global Medical business, and really, our only major presence in the Medical business abroad is our strong position in the German marketplace, although we have meaningful Medical businesses in a number of other European countries. Growth in this market during the quarter was largely fueled by increased penetration of large group practices here in the United States and solid growth in sales of pharmaceutical products. As Steven mentioned, the mild winter weather resulted in significantly lower sales of diagnostic consumable products. The overall business, the other products actually did very well, and we believe we continue to gain market share in the Medical business in the United States. Likewise, our business in Europe, although pretty small, did well and is positioning us to increase our global footprint in the medical arena, which is primarily focused on the office space and other alternate care site facilities.","Now the global technology and value-added services units, very, very important, of course, important from a profitability point-of-view, very, very profitable business unit but more importantly, profitable, more importantly, this unit provides stickiness. The connection between our customers and Henry Schein in the area of Value-Added Services is terrific. Our goal is to help practitioners operate a better business so that our customers can provide better clinical care and the global Technology and Value-Added Services unit in fact is a key ingredient in this success formula. ","The performance of this group continued to be excellent during the first quarter, with strong internal growth in the United States, bolstered by our strategic acquisitions including our Animal Health businesses, which are really coming together very, very nicely in the practice solutions area and a great complement to the Butler Schein merger, which has been so successful. More than 85% of the technology and value-added services group revenue is at this point in time, still derived from North America. In mid-April, we acquired ImproMed, which is a small company with annual revenue of $4.5 million based in Barcelona, which provides practice management and software to dental practices in Spain. The $4.5 million is not as important as the fact that we have -- we continue to advance our strategy for tuck-in acquisitions on the distribution side, but very important on the practice solutions side, which is a business that's somewhere around $250 million today and plays as well as a critical role in the profits of Schein, but more importantly the stickiness of the relationship between Henry Schein and our customers and indeed, the connectivity between Henry Schein, our customers and many of our suppliers, lots and lots of exciting opportunity here. ","We strive to stay on the leading edge of technology solutions and in March, we launched Dentrix G5, which is a new version of the Dentrix practice management system. Dentrix G5 has multiple new features including new database architecture. The architecture improves product performance and also allows Dentrix to become an open platform for other dental applications and technology to link directly into Dentrix. Very exciting, and for those that are really interested in our business from a micro -- a more micro point-of-view, it's probably a good idea to take a look at what Dentrix is doing at the next dental show or speak to a practitioner that is a Dentrix customer. To support developers writing for the Dentrix platform, we launched the Dentrix developer program. Many developers, often not employed by the company, are now writing applications that are compatible with Dentrix, of course, the leading provider of dental software in the world and are in the process of joining the program. This means Dentrix soon will have a multiple of new applications that are integrated with Dentrix, which will allow them to build out their digital office. As another technology development, in mid April, we opened the Henry Schein TechCentral Solutions Center to provide comprehensive customer support for dental and office technology solutions. TechCentral brings together experts in Dentrix, Easy Dental and a multiple of other practice management solutions systems we offer, and more importantly, with various technology disciplines combined with software and other technology disciplines, including hardware and wiring of practices, et cetera. These professionals work together as one team to provide customers with a 360-degree support and not merely help for a single product. We know for a fact that the dental practice achieves greater efficiency, lower operating costs to provide better patient care within an integrated networking solution, and we have done a very good job in this area on the dental side and the Animal Health side. TechCentral continues to make it faster and easier for our customers to get the expert support they need without having to call multiple companies. We, of course, have similar programs in the medical arena, not quite as advanced as the dental and Animal Health, though. ","So Steven and I would be happy to take questions, but before we do that, let me just go through 2 further comments related to the industry rankings that Team Schein is so proud of, and again, so happy with the team today. Started out, we went public with a few thousand Team Schein Members, and now over 15,000 Team Schein members spread out over about 400 locations around the world, providing business and providing support to about 775,000 practices, about 1 million practitioners. Henry Schein was once again ranked first in our industry overall Fortune 2012 List of the Most Admired Companies. We repeated our first-place ranking for 2011 in the categories of social responsibility and global competitiveness, showing that the of twinning of global responsibility and business provides great results for the other constituents, mainly our suppliers, our customers, our team, our investors, in the context of making a difference in society. It really works in our formulation and is a great model for us. We also ranked first in the categories of quality in management, quality of products and services and long-term investment. Of course, we are gratified that the team was recognized for the strength in our global management, the quality of our products and services and our supplier partners -- and the relationship with our supplier partners, and the steady predictable return that we have delivered to our shareholders for so many years. ","Separately, Henry Schein was named to Ethisphere's 2012 List of the most -- the World's Most Ethical Companies. This is the first time Henry Schein appeared on this list, which has been published for the past 6 years. The Ethisphere Institute is an international think tank dedicated to creation, advancement and sharing of best practices in business ethics, corporate social responsibility, anticorruption and sustainability. Out of the 5,000 nominations, Henry Schein was named to the list as -- list of 145 companies for raising the bar for ethical standards within the health care industry. A deep commitment to this highest ethical standards of business practice has been the hallmark of Henry Schein for the past 80 years. In fact, this is our 80th anniversary this year. This commitment continues to be at the very core of the business model as we become more of a global company advancing our team of 15,000 Team Schein members around the world. ","So on a final note, we're very excited as we go into the 16th year as a public company and the 80th anniversary of our founding. So thank you to those shareholders that have been with us since the beginning and those that have joined us along the way. We remain extremely bullish about the company. There are lots of challenges. The world economy is not stable in every respect. Not every metric is working in the right direction. Having said that, I think we have an outstanding management team, a committed organization and have a pretty good strategic plan that we're advancing and fanning out throughout the organization. So Steve and I would be now, be happy to answer any questions that callers may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Stan, I just wanted to follow-up with you on some comments you just made. You basically said like not everything is working in every market, and it's not perfect, but you showed pretty solid organic growth trends across all your businesses, across all your geographies, really, and I'm kind of curious as to Europe is particularly surprising given what we hear from the macro commentary. I'm surprised that your International business is growing faster than your North American business. And so I'm wondering if you can comment on that. Do you think if it's more share gains or is maybe the market over there maybe a little bit better than we all think?","Stanley M. Bergman","Very good question, Glen. So I think one has to peel the onion a bit. Yes, let's deal with the challenges to start with. Italy, Spain, Portugal, the markets are not that good. We are gaining market share, but there's some challenges. Germany is on the positive side. We continue to gain market share, but the market overall is okay as well. The U.K. is challenged, although we are doing quite well in the U.K. We're working with some of the larger groups. I think we've adapted quite well to some of the concerns relative to the change in reimbursement. The Benelux countries are doing okay. France, at least from a Schein point-of-view, is doing okay. We, of course, are guarded and trying to figure out what the election -- the impact of the election will have on our business. And of course, our business is primarily a dental business, although we have an interest in a nonconsolidated Animal Health business. That's a nice business, we do not consolidate it. And it's a very small investment, but a decent-sized business. Australia and New Zealand, I think there are -- it is a lumpy market, but overall, the economy is healthy. I think just like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, did a little bit better during the recessionary period and both markets are quite solid. So in general, the comments I gave you are not specifically related to this quarter, but in general, giving you a feel. Of course, in North America the U.S. seems to be doing better. There are weeks that the economy, at least from our point-of-view, business is very good and there may be a week where we say, is there a challenge? But overall, I think our team is quite bullish, the pipeline for equipment, although there's no guarantee that we WILL actually install this equipment in the quarter, or uninstall it, seems to be solid, and so I think that\u2019s sort of a bit of a view around the world. I think the dental market is okay around the world, the Animal Health market certainly seems fine, and medical is a very small business for us outside of the U.S., although we are doing okay and maybe 2 years ago, we're not doing so well, but now we are.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Hey Stan, maybe if I could just ask one quick follow-up on the equipment side, I mean, given the strong organic trends and it sounds like most of the markets are generally doing okay. What do you make of the equipment number continuing to lag? And what do you think's causing that, and you just sort of commented you think your pipeline on equipment looks good, and so would you expect those trends to reverse here as fiscal '12 unfolds?","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, first of all, I think Steven was quite clear on the swing between the fourth quarter and the first quarter as it relates to the most productive week in the year. So and Steven can take you through that in specifics so I think the quarter was probably, if you adjust for this, but again, this is very hard to get the precise number, was a positive quarter and that was on the heels of a very, very strong previous year. So I think the equipment business is okay. We perhaps are a little bit more optimistic, but don't want to give predictions for the next quarter. But again, we're what, one month into the next quarter? So I think the trend you saw in the last, what, 8 quarters in equipment is kind of continuing. Dentists feel that they should invest in their practice, and they're doing that. Financing doesn't seem to be difficult, it's there, and the cost is very low and the traffic seems to be getting a little better. So we're not at 2006, and '05 levels, but we're definitely part of seeing a trend here that continued I don't know the exact quarter, but probably 8, maybe Steven knows or remembers, 8, 9, 10 quarters ago.","Steven Paladino","Yes, Glen, I would just echo that. I think if you look at that North American equipment, our North American Dental team really did an extraordinary job in promoting all of the year end tax benefits for buying equipment and we really had an outstanding Q4 that, to some extent pulled some sales from Q1. I think we certainly believe that the adjusted 1.5% equipment sales growth that we reported for Q1 for North American Dental equipment sales, we expect it to grow that sales growth. I don't want to give specific guidance on it, but we do expect it to grow during the year. So we feel like equipment sales was more of a timing impact with the strong Q4, and you will see improvement as the year progresses.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just actually wanted to focus on Animal Health a little bit. Clearly much stronger results there in the quarter than what we've seen recently and certainly what we were looking for. It sounds maybe a little bit of the strength helped by flea and tick, but maybe taking that out, could you guys maybe just comment about how we should be thinking about the growth of the core business in Animal Health? And is maybe some of this just pent-up demand from a generally weak economy the last several quarters?","Stanley M. Bergman","Without getting into micro, but it's very actually hard to get to specific trends, there are all sorts of indices one can look at, but I think when you take a look at this market in general, you have to understand how agency sales switch between GAAP sales, where the sale is fully recognized and agency sale, you have to look at that. You have to understand the large animal versus the companion animal information, and there's very little information available as to the performance of others in the marketplace on a bifurcated basis. You then have to take a look at price impact, and there have been some very nice launches in the field, to mention the Trifexis, Comfortis situation so one has to understand all of these. Having said that, the market seems to be growing. I don't think it went down as much as some people reported, and it may not be booming as much as others are thinking today. But it is a market that is growing in the 100s of basis points, and it's a good market, and from a Henry Schein point-of-view, we believe we're gaining market share. We believe that our software acquisition, the expansion of products that we're offering to veterinarians, the value-added side and -- is doing well. I think from a Henry Schein point-of-view, you have to remember that in 2010, our sales force was inwardly focused during the integration period. Some of that went into 2011, but as the year continued, and even going into the first quarter, we think we are in a good shape -- not good, outstanding shape from a sales organization point-of-view and that's helping us gain market share. So there's many puts and takes here, and I don't think we can give you a one-sentence answer on this.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow up around Animal Health, and specifically the acquisition of AUV announced in the quarter. It sounds like that acquisition is going to be slightly dilutive to 2012. I was wondering if that's still the case, just relative to the updated guidance that you gave today. I don't believe that was included before. And then, I guess longer-term around Animal Health and relative to this acquisition, I think you said it was about a 1% operating margin. Could you maybe just talk about the operating margin profile of the vet business in light of this acquisition? Or maybe timing that you expect to get those margins closer to current vet operating margins?","Steven Paladino","Sure, so yes, a couple of questions there. So first our guidance that we issued today includes the AUV acquisition, which will be slightly dilutive for the balance of the year, and we think it's $0.01 or $0.02, not something significant, slightly dilutive. A big factor for that is the professional and onetime fees needed to close the acquisition, which is driving some of that dilution and really, not much synergies achieved. Because remember, the deal is not closed yet; it's expected to close by, let's say end of Q2, maybe early Q3, at the latest. So there's not really a lot of synergies that we can achieve going forward in a 6-month period. Longer term, we believe that, that 1% operating margin has potential to get up significantly higher, mid single-digit range over a number of years. So it's not a one-year activity. And last I want to point out, because there were, we did talk about the purchase price, which was $38 million, and we -- there were estimates out there for significantly higher. Some people had estimates out there equal to onetime sales, which would have been close to $300 million. So we paid because -- we paid a price, which we felt was a fair price, but because the business is only 1% operating margin today. But again we think that the inclusion of some of our purchasing synergies and global expertise in distribution and things like that, we have good opportunity to raise operating margin. So we feel good with the acquisition. And it's a healthy size from a revenue -- just under $300 million in revenue. So overall, the main reason why Animal Health all-in margins are lower, I think we talked about this before, is because of the percentage of pharmaceuticals, which carry a lower gross and operating margin, and it\u2019s critical to carry. Obviously, the pharmaceuticals are a big part of what veterinarians dispense and offer to pet owners. So again, we feel good about the acquisition and the opportunities, but I just will caution that it will take us a little bit of time to realize the synergies.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Steve, was there an acquisition in the North American Dental unit in the period? And then does your revised outlook contemplate any incremental share repurchases due the balance of 2012?","Steven Paladino","So there was really, trying to just check. I think there was the tail end of an acquisition in Dental but it was very tiny. Just trying to check which one it was. Let me answer the second question first as I get that information from the -- the guidance really does not assume any significant amount of stock buyback. We don't want the guidance to get ahead of the stock buyback because if, for some reason, we wind up buying less than our expectations, we don't want to have the guidance at risk. So really, we think that there's a little bit baked in, but the bulk of it is not baked into our guidance. As far as the acquisition growth, the primary acquisition in global Dental was the Sogim acquisition in France, but there was in the U.S. a small, a very small acquisition that we didn't announce on the Dental side, so yes there was a little bit of acquisition activity in the global Dental piece.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then secondly, what is your revised EPS outlook factor for FX headwinds? And I guess if you could be more specific around the euro-U.S. dollar rate, it\u2019d be helpful.","Steven Paladino","Sure. We're still being a little bit conservative in our guidance on FX rates. We have utilized in our guidance a lower exchange rate specifically for the Euro, which is the primary currency that impacts us, so we're using a lower rate than the current $1.30, $1.02 exchange rate that we're at, to be a little bit conservative there, and given that we're not sure exactly which way it's going to go, and hard to predict, there's a little bit of conservatism still built into our FX rate and our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to make sure I heard a couple of numbers right. It\u2019s clearly, a lot of moving parts this quarter, so when you guys mentioned there was a 10% growth in internal Dental consumables and 6% growth in internal dental equipment, I wasn't clear if whether that was the global sales or international sales. So I just want to try to confirm that first.","Stanley M. Bergman","Okay, yes, so both of those numbers, the 10% local internal growth were for the international Dental merchandise, and the 6% was the international Dental equipment.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, so that\u2019s international. Okay so then do you happen to have the global numbers, then? Global breakdown between global Dental consumables and equipment internal.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. So let me give you -- the reported numbers global Dental merchandise growth, this is again local internal, is 8.2% and global Dental equipment minus 0.2%, and that translates to overall local internal on a combined basis of merch and equipment of 6.2%. And again, just to highlight again the dental equipment sales were negatively impacted by this last week of the year, and that minus 0.2% becomes plus 3.6% on a global basis when you adjust for that.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I think some of the other questions kind of touched on this, but just generally speaking, does it seem like consumables growth should be outpacing equipment for the rest of this year? Or just I guess any additional general thoughts on the consumables versus equipment growth within Dental for the rest of the year.","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, remember, consumable growth had significant tail winds because of this calendar week issue, whereas the opposite was true on equipment. So when you normalize for that, again the worldwide global Dental consumable merchandise comes down a bit to 4.7%, and that's clearly, we think, gaining market share. If the market is growing in the 2% or 3% range, that's probably a bullish estimate of what the combined market is. So we're growing at close to double that on an adjusted basis. Typically, the merchandise sales as people are feeling more optimistic and patient traffic continues to be improving to steady, is where you first see a benefit and then as the consumable sales continue to do well, people become more bullish on equipment. So equipment generally takes a little bit longer to catch up to the market improvements than the consumables.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, the organic trends look good. Congrats on that. They're ahead of where we thought they'd be, but we're still looking at the capital deployment side of your business model here. It looks like the deals added, I think you broke out 0.6% growth to revenues are about $12 million, and I\u2019m looking at here minority interest line item and track only about $2 million, so if I look at all-in deal spending of about $211 million, looks like you generated maybe $3 million or so in incremental contribution. Is that the best use of your capital? I would think a share repurchase of size and magnitude would get you more.","Steven Paladino","Well, you know, we can offline, Bob; I don't think your math is accurate on using that minority interest, but offline we can go through that. As far as your general question on capital deployment, we feel like the balance sheet and the cash flow is strong enough that we can do a very sizable stock buyback annually, and again, our goal is $200 million to $300 million per year on a continuous basis, so it's not a one-time shot. We want to see that share count shrink continuously over time. But you can't buy back all your shares and get to prosperity that way. So we do feel that using capital to grow businesses and you've got to be careful on first-year impact of acquisitions. The way the accounting works with professional fees, per share benefit on acquisition growth is nominal; the second and third year we should get good returns on investments. Our goal is to get double-digit in fact, mid teens pretax return on investment by year 2 or 3. So we feel that, that's a good deployment of strategy, and you have to also realize that as we expand globally, take for example, on the Animal Health side, the benefits to all of the other business units because of supplier relationships and best practices and other factors aren't exclusively shown in the acquisition model. They also are shown in the existing businesses, so we think we should do both.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, all right, that's helpful. And just a question. Did you break out a benefit from the leap year at all for the businesses?","Steven Paladino","The quarter had the same number of weeks. There is no benefit. We have said consistently is that 2012 has one less week versus 2011, so that's all baked into our full year guidance. It's not equivalent to, on a EPS basis, you know exactly 1\/52 of a year. It's a little bit less than that because it's a slower week for consumables that drives it. But that we\u2019ve talked about a couple of times, if that's helpful.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I was thinking the extra day in February, but that's fine.","Steven Paladino","Okay, so no, we didn't really, we didn't give any data on that. And again, because we're on the same number of weeks -- for us, we don't actually have an extra day for leap year. We have the same number of weeks, 13 weeks every quarter. It's not the same as a calendar month end.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, you know what, you just touched on it, but I just want to, my inbox got flooded with about 20 e-mails as you were going through the timing issues in your prepared remarks. Just want to confirm, no extra selling week this quarter; it was purely timing of a soft consumables quarter last year in the first quarter that gets dropped out this quarter and that's what helped kind of the higher growth rates on the consumable side.","Steven Paladino","Yes, so again, just to be very clear for everyone on the call, and you have it exactly right, same number of weeks, same number of days in Q1 this year versus last year, but all of our adjusted sales growth were reflecting that last year's Q1 included the holiday week, the Christmas\/ New Year's week, which is on consumables, on everything but Dental Equipment, a soft week. And what we broke out is that because of that easy comparable last year, that our sales growth was favorable because of that. And just to resummarize, the reported local internal growth on a worldwide basis was 7.8%. That's reported-to-reported, but the adjusted, when factoring in that favorable comparability in Q1, was 5.6%. So it's about 2 percentage points that it helped us during the quarter. And we wanted to be as transparent as possible and take people through that, because even though it was a very strong sales growth quarter, part of it was related to this.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, fair enough. And just on the margin side, it sounds like AUV, at least my math, may be at 20 basis point headwind operating margins, once that deal closes, the company-wide margin for 4 quarters then. But you do 53 basis points this quarter. Maybe you've got a little bit timing benefit as well. But how do you think about margins developing over the rest of this year? A good quarter this quarter. Can some of the expansion continue over the next 3?","Steven Paladino","I would be cautious. Our goal, we were at the high end of our goal for the quarter, which is the 50 basis points. I think that was driven in part because of very strong internal sales growth. So we still expect margin expansion on a full year basis, but maybe not quite to the same level that we experienced in Q1.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And last question, just why was working capital such a big use of cash this quarter that drove operating cash flow negative?","Steven Paladino","It was really 2 areas, trade accounts receivable, which we had very strong cash collections at the year-end for Q4. Again the timing of our year-end, which was December 31, in 2011, a lot of people for tax reasons, I think, paid at the end of the year in order to get the tax deduction if they're on a cash basis. So we think it was primarily timing on the working capital, both on the trade receivables and the trade payables, where we took advantage of cash discounts. It's just the timing of it. Overall, free cash flow and operating cash flow, we're still expecting to be very strong for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Michael R. Minchak - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa this morning. First, just with respect to the updated 2012 guidance, you took the range up by roughly the amount of the beat in the first quarter relative to consensus. Can you talk about what drove the strength in the first quarter versus your internal expectations? And I know you had mentioned the weather benefit, but was there anything else that positively impacted the first quarter that you don't see -- expect to see a continuing benefit of, over the course of the year?","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, it's a difficult question because it's not just the weather or the easy comparable on some of the sales categories. We had absolutely a very strong internal sales growth, despite all of those other factors that provided some tailwind across the board. We still think that the markets Stanley talked about, just a little bit, the markets still have some uncertainty. So we're trying to be conservative in our overall guidance I talked about earlier; foreign exchange that we're trying to be conservative. And you know, but we feel like things, certainly since last conference call and 2 conference calls ago, we\u2019re feeling like our markets are continuing to improve gradually, and the ones that really aren't improving, maybe some of the Mediterranean countries, that they're at least stabilizing in our market. So we feel bullish, and we want to have guidance out there that we don't have to change on the downside, should some of these uncertainties materialize.","Michael R. Minchak - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. And then maybe just to drill down a little bit on the equipment side, I was wondering if you could provide any incremental color or breakdown on the trends, both within high-tech and basic equipment in the quarter? Is one growing faster than the other? And then maybe if you can comment at all on E4D?","Stanley M. Bergman","Sure. Well, high-tech and specifically, E4D had very -- had a very strong quarter for Q1, but we also saw improving growth in traditional equipment so it wasn't just related to the high-tech, but high-tech was stronger than traditional for us. And the strongest within high-tech was the E4D CAD\/CAM business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Elliot Feldman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Elliot Feldman filling in for Larry. Just a quick question on the Medical business. A bit of a sequential slowdown in organic growth but obviously, following a pretty good growth in 2011. Just wondering if you could provide any updates also for what you're seeing around broader utilization patient traffic trends, I mean, discuss about that a little bit and perhaps, maybe more importantly, the competitive environment in the space. I know you got some pretty nice market share gains last year, so any updated thoughts on that would be great.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I think again, we commented and Steven commented in, I think quite depth here, you need to take into account these sales of diagnostic products in the quarter. There was a significant dip because of the mild season, particularly relating to flu and that kind of problem. So we believe the 3.4% internal growth in local currencies for North American Medical sales would have been approximately 6%, somewhere around that, hard to tell, if not adversely impacted by the mild winter weather. So overall, I think this is in line with the kind of sales we've shown, the growth we've shown for a while now, for many quarters. Maybe it's a little bit, slightly better from, I can't recall, Steven, what it was last quarter.","Steven Paladino","It wasn't slightly better, but it was comparable.","Stanley M. Bergman","Comparable. So I mean we've been showing this mid single-digit growth now for a while, hard to tell again what's the market, the exact market growth rate is because there's little data available. We believe we increased sales to our larger group practices by something like 20% in North America. And we had some strong pharmaceutical sales, specifically to the larger practices, so all of this contributed to our sales in North America, and we believe, as we have, I think indicated and shown for a while now, that we are increasing market share. So I can't give you more specifics than that. But I think it would be wrong to characterize our sales as anything but growing market share, and that the market is a solid market. It's changing significantly and, I think it was about 3 years ago we, or maybe a little longer that, when we created our Health Care Services group to focus on the larger practices and the new kinds of entities emerging. And this group has done very, very well and we continue to grow market share in the newer entities and the larger entities. So the Medical business is growing. Of course, there are some challenges with margins, but we have to manage through that.","Elliot Feldman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And Steve, I know I may be a little bit too early in asking this. I know it's only May but just around flu, given some of the changes to the contractual agreements you guys have announced this year, coming off a pretty weak flu season, any early expectations you guys can provide us for that business, later this year we can \u2013 might be able to see in the back half?","Steven Paladino","It's still really early in the season and because of the mild winter, we believe that the pre-book activity, people haven't really mentally turned to thinking about buying flu vaccine for the upcoming season. Expectations are basically to sell a similar amount of doses as we sold last year, which was about 11.5 million doses. There's really not any reason at this point in any data points to have a different opinion than that. Our new contract, we think, provides us the opportunity for better profitability, as well as the age indications on the new manufacturer are lower, so that's helpful to some practitioners that are serving younger patients. But it's still very early on, really, to have any better intelligence in that market.","Operator","We only have time for one more question and your question comes from Jonathan Block with SunTrust.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Maybe just 2 quick ones. The first is on the Animal Health side. Several weeks ago, one of the manufacturers announced their intention to have at least one of their distributors go ahead and be able to become sort of a generalist, selling products of some of their competitors, and so maybe just your thoughts on IDEX\u2019s announcement and how you view that relationship going forward?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, first of all, we view our relationship with IDEX to be a very good one. I think our value-add service model is a good one. That, I think, fits in very well with their strategy. We are both committed to advancing the operating efficiency of practices, helping them run a better practice, so that they can provide better clinical care. Obviously, the announcement by IDEX is a new one. We are in dialogue with them; we're evaluating, and I think we need to understand more of what this means at this stage. And so I would say that's -- we are a very good customer of IDEX and the relationship between the 2 companies, it's very good. We see global opportunity, actually, in expanding our relationship with IDEX so, and I think the services that our practice solutions business can offer to IDEX and to others out there, I might add, is something rather unique. And so we are committed to advancing our relationship with IDEX, but can't comment on any specific economics much there.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then last one, Stanley, earlier in the call, you gave a lot of great color on international markets, how things are playing out. On just big picture, can you speak to maybe where you're seeing some more resiliency? In other words, again, you gave color by market, but when you look to sort of Vet versus either Dental, does one stand out more than other, showing a bit more resiliency in some particular markets?","Stanley M. Bergman","That's a good question. I think actually on average, both the Dental market, as a global vertical and the Animal Health market on a global vertical basis are in much better shape than we were in fourth quarter 2008 and of course, 2009. We started seeing positive trends in 2010, which continued in '11. I would say if I look at what's really directly in front of us, I would be bullish, but I think one has to remember that there's a wider -- there are wider macro trends out there, and we have to run our business very conservatively in case we experience macro bumps along the way. But having said that, I think both markets at the second, looking out, very short-term, look to be okay, globally. I mean, we covered all the specifics by country, but I think the global Dental market is, at this point in time, looking short-term, is much more positive that it's been in a while. I think the same is on the Animal Health side, but again, one has to be very, very cautious in this environment, and I think everybody on this call is aware that the economy looks to be like it's doing a little bit better, but none of us would be surprised if there were negative bumps along the way. So, and we have to deliver on our commitments. So we are optimistic, but very cautious.","So thank you, everyone for participating in the call. Thank you for the good questions. Of course, Stephen is available should anyone have any questions at (631) 843-5915. Susan Vassallo is -- who heads our communications, can also be reached at 5562. And again, as noted, I think the tone is that we're feeling very good about the state of the company, about our strategy. I think we've made good investments. Obviously, when you make an investment, the return doesn't come right away. Businesses that we invest in take time to integrate and to optimize. We are investing and expanding our global footprint, and investing and expanding our product offering. We didn't cover the Dental side in much detail. With regard to that, we're investing in the specialty areas, doing very well over there. I think our global Dental footprint is a good one. I don't know the exact number, but somewhere around the $5 billion Animal -- Dental business, lots of synergies from best practices point-of-view here, implementing technology ideas, implementing a greater focus on providing a one-stop shop to specialists. All of this is working well in combination with our advancements in the whole change in digitalization of the prosthetics and implants field. I think the Dental business is very, very exciting. The globalization of our Animal Health business is exciting and the terrific work we're doing in the U.S. to address some of the new forms of health care delivery and expansion of some of the larger clinics and IDNs is all very exciting. So we're very optimistic about our capabilities and the morale in the company, the talent we've added. But you know, and I think Steven is right, when he's cautious about providing too positive an outlook for the future, as we -- none of us know what kind of speed bumps we will encounter along the way, and we want to make sure that we deliver on our commitments as we did throughout the recession.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Clinicia, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2018 third quarter. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.","The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 6, 2018. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up during Q&A to allow as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour that we have allotted for this call.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Carolynne, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our third quarter financial results which demonstrate, of course, continued solid growth in each of our business groups. We believe that the end markets we serve are stable, in fact, leading to improving and that we have continued to gain market share with our value-added solutions approach to servicing customers. And we believe that we continue to gain market share in all of our business units.","We also are pleased with our progress relative to our long range long-term strategic goals with a balance of organic growth, resulting from our consultative approach and close relationship with our customers, augmented by growth from acquisitions. We have a focus on adding a greater proportion of higher margin products across our businesses and deepening the breadth of our value-added solutions across the globe.","We are fulfilling these goals with our investment in higher margin dental specialties and software capabilities which we'll talk about more later in the call and, of course, very pleased to answer specific questions.","So we continue to believe we have a healthy business. We are well positioned to take advantage of many opportunities we have for investing in long-term growth of the business. The strategic plan, we believe, is the most solid in all this time in Henry Schein's history. And we are confident that we will continue the track record of good planning, good execution as we enter into our 23rd year as a public company.","So at this time, I'll ask Steve to review our financial results and to provide some further guidance on the numbers. And then I'll provide additional commentary on our recent business performance and our accomplishments. So, Steven, please.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q3 2018 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release, which can be found and is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.","These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, again you could see Exhibit B in today's earnings release, as well as it's included on the Investor Relations section of our website.","So turning to our results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 29, 2018, were $3.3 billion, reflecting a 3.8% increase compared with the third quarter of 2017 with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 3.2%. When you also exclude the impact of certain products switching from direct sales to agency sales, our normalized internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.1%. You can see the details of our sales growth on Exhibit A of our earnings news release.","On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the quarter \u2013 our third quarter of 2018 was 5.1% and contracted by 170 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2017. However, on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring costs, transaction costs related to the Animal Health spin-off, as well as the litigation settlement expense, our operating margin was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis.","You can see the reconciliation of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income in the appendix and our corporate slide set, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website.","As we have previously mentioned, we have a continued focus on increasing sales of higher margin products to drive gross margin improvements across all of our businesses.","Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 19.6%. This compares to 29.0% GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes certain items detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release, our effective tax rate was 23.2%. And that compares to 29.0% in the third quarter of 2017 also on a non-GAAP basis. We believe our full year 2018 GAAP effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% for the full year.","Moving on, our net income attributable to Henry Schein for Q3 of 2018 was $121.5 million or $0.79 per diluted share on a GAAP basis and represents declines of 12% and 9% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2017. However, again, non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter of 2018 was $158.0 million or $1.03 per diluted share. This represents growth of 14.5% and 18.4% respectively compared with the third quarter of 2017 GAAP results.","Providing additional detail on our results for the quarter. Amortization from acquired intangible assets was $30.4 million pre-tax or $0.15 per diluted share for Q3 2018 and compared to $29.3 million pre-tax or $0.13 per diluted share in the same period last year.","For the first nine months of the year, our amortization from acquired intangible assets was $91.7 million pre-tax or $0.45 per diluted share. I'll also note that foreign currency exchange did not have a material impact on our diluted EPS for the quarter.","Let me now provide some details on our sales results for the third quarter. Dental sales increased 2.4% to $1.5 billion with internal growth in local currencies of 3.5%. Our North American internal growth in local currencies was 4.7% and included 4.3% growth in dental consumable merchandise as well as an increase of 5.9% in dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our sales growth was primarily driven by market share gains.","Our equipment sales result was bolstered by growth of approximately 23% in the overall high-tech equipment category. A highlight of our dental equipment performance was in sales of total CAD\/CAM solutions. Internal sales in local currencies were up 43% in North America during Q3, while digital imaging sales, which includes 2D and 3D imaging, grew by approximately 14%. Also our digital impression scanner sales increased by more than 50% in Q3 for North America.","Our international Dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 1.6% and included 3.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. Our dental equipment sales and service revenue declined by 4.2% versus the same period last year. And this is generally due to softer end markets, primarily in Germany.","Animal Health sales were $899.3 million for the quarter, an increase of 1.9% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 1.1%. The 1.1% internal growth in local currencies included 0.4% growth in North America. However, it's important to note when normalizing for the impact of the manufacturer switching from direct sales to agency sales, our North American sales growth was 6.7%.","International Animal Health internal sales growth in local currencies was 1.8%. We reported lower sales, primarily associated with the decline in parasiticide sales, as well as clinic visits internationally primarily due to weather.","Our Medical sales was $721.9 million in the third quarter, an increase of 4.5% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 4.4%. The impact from foreign exchange was not material this quarter. The 4.4% growth included 4.4% growth in North America and 5.7% growth internationally. We are pleased with our overall Medical sales results which were primarily driven by solid organic growth from existing large customers.","Turning to Technology and Value-Added Services sales. They were $143.9 million in the third quarter, an increase of 32% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 7.8%. We are very pleased with the strong growth driven by Henry Schein One along with solid organic growth both in North America and internationally.","In North America, Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 7.8% in local currencies, which is the highest quarterly growth rate in more than two years. This growth was bolstered by a sale to the U.S. Department of Defense of approximately $6.2 million, along with strong growth in the financial services business.","Our international markets' internal sales growth in local currencies was 7.6% and driven primarily by dental software sales. We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the third quarter. Specifically we repurchased approximately 777,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $78.19 per share or approximately $61 million. The impact of the repurchase of shares for this third quarter was not material to our EPS.","At the close of the third quarter, we had approximately $86 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $173.9 million. And that compares to $131.4 million in the third quarter of last year. We continue to believe we'll have ongoing continued strong operating cash flow for the full year.","Our previously disclosed restructuring initiatives is progressing as planned and will continue for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned last quarter, this initiative will allow us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure and fund new initiatives that we believe will drive future growth under our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan.","As previously noted, we expect to record a onetime restructuring charge in 2018 between $45 million and $55 million in total on a pre-tax basis or $0.22 to $0.27 per diluted share. This restructuring charge primarily includes severance, facility closing costs and certain outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan. We plan to provide more detail on anticipated cost savings associated with the restructuring at a later date.","I'll now conclude my remarks by noting, we are reaffirming our 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range. At this time we are not able to provide estimates for the impact of total costs related to the Animal Health spin-off on a full year basis. Therefore we cannot provide GAAP guidance at this time.","Note that the 2018 guidance is based on current revenue recognition standards. Although, the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 will not have a material change to our earnings results.","The 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be in the range of $4.06 to $4.14 reflecting both the 13% to 15% compared with the 2017 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.60. This guidance exclude certain items in 2018 for the year-to-date that are noted in Exhibit B in today's press release and provides a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EPS to non-GAAP net income and EPS.","2017 non-GAAP results excluded costs related to taxes associated with the U.S. tax reform legislation as well as a loss associated with the divestiture of the equity ownership in E4D and certain litigation settlement expenses. We assume in our guidance that the end markets will continue to remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions.","The guidance for 2018 diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for continuing operations as always, but does not include any future potential acquisitions. The guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are consistent with current levels.","I'll also note that, due to the complexities and timing of the planned Animal Health spin-off, we plan to provide 2019 guidance at a later date as some of those uncertainties become clearer.","With that, let me now turn it back over to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you very much, Steven. Let's review some business highlights for our third quarter 2018. In Dental, we were pleased, actually very pleased with our 4.3% internal sales growth in local currencies in our North American dental consumable merchandise business. This is market driven by growth \u2013 this was driven by, to a large extent, market share gains. But the market is growing and actually we believe leading in a positive direction. So one could conclude in our view that the end markets are stable and generally healthy.","Our mid-single digit North American dental equipment sales growth was driven by several manufacturers with strong growth in high-tech equipment sales. As Steven mentioned, we continue to see solid demand for the Dentsply Sirona equipment in North America and Europe and in particular in CAD\/CAM.","We're also seeing good growth with other manufacturing partners with digital prosthetics solutions as many clinics elect to purchase digital scanners to improve imaging accuracy and patient comfort. Sales of these products in North America grew by more than 50% during the third quarter.","So, overall very, very pleased with our North American Dental business. As you may recall, in late September we announced investments in three implant companies Intra-Lock, Medentis Medical and Pro-Cam Implants with combined annual sales of approximately $45 million.","Intra-Lock offers innovative dental restoration solutions including proprietary surface, connection, biomaterial and small diameter implant technologies, very important addition of products know-how to our overall implant business. With Medentis, we are expanding into the lower priced segment of the dental implant markets. And with our investment in Pro-Cam, CAMLOG's exclusive distributor in the Netherlands, we are strengthening our geographic footprint in Europe.","These companies complement our existing solutions for implant based tooth replacement and are expected to broaden our geographic reach, add innovative technologies as noted, enhance our manufacturing footprint and solid our commitment to serve both the value premium and the lower priced segment of the implant market.","Related to the dental specialties, we are quite pleased with the reception to our SLX Clear Aligner System which we soft launched in May to the specialist community in North America, that's orthodontic specialty community. And we expect to begin targeting general practitioners in the New Year.","This unique solution was designed to reduce overall treatment time while improving practice efficiency. We make it easy for clinicians to submit cases through a broad range of intraoral scanners including our TROIS (20:30), 3Shape, 3M, Planmeca, and CEREC.","Generally we're a big fan of open technology. We're in early stages of educating the market on the benefit of our competitive solution and are optimistic that our system will help advance our orthodontic product line over time. And generally, the orthodontic business has been very good at coming out with unique products.","Now, let's move on to the Animal Health business. Here we are pleased with the global Animal Health sales growth in the third quarter, particularly, in North America with normalized internal local currency growth of 6.7%. I think it's very important to understand that the Animal Health sales need to be normalized for a switch between regular GAAP booking of sales, agency sales, and back again. And we have provided consistent reporting on this over the years and so I think the 6.7% growth is reflective of our real achievements in the marketplace.","We believe our continued solid sales growth reflects a healthy end market and demonstrates that veteran clinics rely on our commitment to offering a wide range of products, software, and value-added solutions for their practices only to be magnified with the merger with VFC, more about that later.","Our Medical business also continued to perform well with mid-single digit growth in local currencies, which is above estimated end market growth rates by quite a bit. We believe our Medical business benefits directly from our strategy focused on understanding and meeting the needs of a diverse set of customers ranging from large integrated delivery networks to ambulatory care centers and, of course, the general practitioners.","Our go-to-market strategy represents a proven combination to help our customers drive successful patient outcomes, include the promotion of contract compliance, lowering cost, navigating reimbursement, and delivering value-based care. We remain committed to providing the products and services and consulting solutions that help our customers efficiently manage their enterprise. And again, we said this over the years, whether it's large or small, we are ready to provide solutions to our customers and position our customers to best serve their patients.","Moving on to our Technology and Value-Added Services businesses. We are pleased with the progress of Henry Schein One dental technology, the dental technology business of Henry Schein One. We see many possibilities to enhance practice success through this unique dental software platform, which delivers one connected technology offering for innovative software, hardware, and services. We are excited about these capabilities working together to enable dental teams to be better business managers, clinicians to be more efficient, and patients to be more loyal to the practice.","We, let me stress, are big proponents of open architecture in this space and do all we can to help our customers succeed with whatever technology choices they may have.","We recently released Dentrix G7 and Dentrix Smart Image, which is the first significant product release for the Henry Schein One joint venture. Dentrix Smart Image represents the next generation of practice management and imaging software all in an intra-operable way. This product suite received Cellerant's Best Of Class Technology Award, a coveted recognition in the dental community for products aimed at improving digital clinical workflow.","Henry Schein One also released enhanced Dentrix service bundles including Optimum Pro for payment management services and Ultimate Service Bundle with demand for some off-site (24:48) solutions, providing enhanced patient engagement and digital marketing capabilities.","We launched our online booking for Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend, our next-generation cloud-based practice management system. In addition, we released the Dentrix Ascend Quick Exam module, offering clinical decision support that helps a doctor focus on treatment plans relevant for the diagnosis. This is a first-of-its-kind solution in the dental industry.","We're very, very pleased with the progress that the joint venture is making. And the R&D work, development work and the actual introduction of upgrades to the marketplace.","Finally, we deployed our cloud-based solution Dentrix Ascend in the UK, expanding its global footprint beyond the U.S. and Australia.","As we look ahead, we expect to release the next generation patient relationship management, PRM, platform later in the fourth quarter of 2018, bringing together several PRM solutions in the Henry Schein One portfolio.","So before we open the call to questions I would like to offer some perspective on the value-added solutions approach, which is focused on four key elements: education, one; service and support, two; software, three \u2013 and innovation, three; and strong customer relationships. This model is one that we believe has worked well for us, withstood the test of time. And as we advance our business will remain as the four pillars of our business, namely education, service and support, software and innovation, and strong customer relationships.","Last quarter we discussed examples of the high-touch approach to enabling our customers to provide best quality patient care, while optimizing efficiency in their practices.","Today, we'd like to take that step one step further. Henry Schein recently launched our Rely On Henry Schein brand campaign, featuring three dental practices and the unique story that reflect our mission. When we say unique, they're unique to those practices, but are stories that are repeated every day in the dental environment, thanks to Henry Schein.","Our unique story reflects our mission to help clinicians be more efficient, more successful, so that they can focus on delivering the best quality care. Visit henryschein.com\/relyonus for specific examples of what would argue is the \u2013 what we would argue is the invaluable consultation and timely service and support we deliver to our customers.","And this is, of course, day-in and day-out. It is really important for our investors to understand the value-added service that we provide to our customers, which is the reason why we have the stickiness and, in the end, the reason why we have gained market share for decades.","So this includes our strong crisis support capabilities, including the triage-like response when a practice owned by one of our Canadian customers burned to the ground. And the customers lost all the patient records with no cloud-based backup, as well as losing all equipment office supplies.","You will see how we helped establish temporary operating space for this group of doctors and helped them build a new nine \u2013 sorry, paperless state-of-the-art facility. When our customer was asked about Henry Schein's role in their recovery, the customer answered, they helped us. Somebody gives you a hand and tells you, when you're all down, come, I'm going to help. You get up.","A typical response to a customer \u2013 from a customer who was helped in an environment where the customer experienced some form of unanticipated damage in their practice.","Next you'll see a fast action from multi-operatory practice in Maryland that had a perfect storm and multiple pieces of critical X-ray equipment failed the same day, causing half of the operatories to be down.","Our customer spoke that Henry Schein \u2013 of Henry Schein reassuring them and immediately focusing on next steps, including a temporary repair of equipment so that these doctors could still see patients that day and facilitating a quick turn on ordering replacement units.","To quote our customers, Henry Schein is the company to go to that offers supplies, tech support and HR support, continuing education. If I had to take the time to research and find the lowest price, it would take manpower and dollars. It's just not worth it. As a clinician, I'd rather spend my time with my patients.","Having said that, we believe our pricing is competitive. And therefore the combination of value-added services and solid good pricing is the winning formula as delivered by our highly educated and most efficient sales organization.","Finally, in a great example of our day-to-day consulting experience, you will meet a doctor in Queens, New York who relied upon Henry Schein as he concentrated opening a new practice in an emerging underserved location. Our team helped this customer from start to finish, as he built his practice including scouring of sales, of sites, selecting of contracts, the designing of the office, choosing the right equipment, accessing financing and marketing to new patients. The customer knows, dental school does not prepare you for this business \u2013 for the business aspects involved in dentistry. He learned as you go. Henry Schein is reliable, it finally helps to have someone to guide you towards what your vision is.","We believe our high-touch full-service value proposition makes a difference in the lives of our customers enabling them to focus on our providing quality care. And we think of no better way to convey that message than to have our customers tell their stories in their own words.","With that operator, we'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","Jeff, are on the line?","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I am. Can you hear me okay, Carolynne?","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes, now we hear you.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'm sorry about that. So a number of questions but let me just focus here on the Dental side and hope the others get picked up throughout the Q&A here. But Steve maybe you could flesh out just a little better what you're seeing in the Dental end market. And if you could provide any color on the specialty market versus the general consumable market, maybe the growth rate you saw in each of those, or in general commentary there that would be helpful.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure. I would say that when we look at the North American Dental market, we feel like the market is stable to improving. We saw a really nice consumable sales growth in our North American Dental side as well as very solid equipment sales growth.","With respect to dental specialty, dental specialty did grow a bit faster than our overall sales growth for consumables in the mid-single digits. When we look at international, we did see internationally, at least this quarter, some softer markets, especially on the equipment side. We're not sure that it's really a trend. We just think sometimes the ebbs and flows of each quarter, it was just a soft equipment sales market. So we're hopeful that we'll see improvements in the fourth quarter when we see our strongest quarter. So overall, Dental, I'd tell you is stable to improving with the slight exception of international equipment sales.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could follow-up just on the CAD\/CAM comments you made on some of those big growth rates. I think last year you said in the third quarter that you saw very little impact in that quarter from your newest CAD\/CAM relationship as you were just coming off that meeting in Vegas. So I guess my question is, once you anniversary now starting in fourth quarter kind of into a full relationship or a full year year-over-year relationship with your newest product there. How are you thinking about CAD\/CAM growth versus DI growth? Just on a normalized basis kind of how do you see the growth in each of those technologies playing out over the next few years?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well, we think there's going to be very strong growth in both categories. There are a big part of the market that wants full systems. But there's also part of the market that wants the digital impressioning today because they are transitioning and they can get into CAD\/CAM at a lower price and then over time they can get the milling machine.","So overall, we feel good about the overall CAD\/CAM market for us. And we think it'll continue to be a nice grower for us. But clearly some of these growth rates are impacted by the fact that we took on the Dentsply Sirona CEREC line last year during Q3.","Important also to note Jeff that we saw a reversal of digital imaging, we said last quarter that digital imaging was very soft. But this quarter we saw a rebound and we saw very strong growth in digital imaging also.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. That's helpful. Thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question is from David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. For the North America Dental growth rate of 4.7%, I mean, how sustainable are these trends? I mean, they seem very robust to me. What do you think is driving that? And then I'm sorry, I didn't catch the CAD\/CAM year-over-year growth rate in the scanners or the CAD\/CAM machines. What was that again please?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure. Overall CAD\/CAM was over 40% growth in the quarter year-over-year. On consumables, David, again we think the market may have improved slightly, but it's slight improvement in the North American consumable market. And really as we've said in the conference call script, we believe that the bulk of the growth is really coming from us executing competition and growing our market share.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then what has the market's response been to the deal with Vets First Choice and Animal Health? How do they view the transaction? Do they view it favorably or not? What do they expect to gain from it once the deal closes? Thanks","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","David, I think generally from customers I would say it's overwhelmingly positive. Sales force is excited. At the end of the day in the vets space, the big need is for compliance, in other words with prescriptions issued, in other words making sure prescriptions that are issued are actually used, making sure that prescriptions are renewed. And generally we believe that VFC solution is the best in the marketplace.","There are others that have solutions, but no one has the comprehensive offering that they have combined with the practice management systems, the PIMS system. So generally I think it's very well-received. The morale in the company is quite good. It's a massive undertaking internally to separate these companies and specifically the infrastructure in Europe. We're making good progress.","The filings have been made with the SEC which responded to first questions. We don't see really much of an issue. And I think generally this is a good strategy for overall Henry Schein. It allows us to focus on human and animal health. And I think for the Animal Health team it provides an opportunity to expand the value-added services in probably a very unique way. I think we have something here that's unique and actually needed by the marketplace both needed by the suppliers and the customers.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","And I would just add on the Animal Health spin, we remain confident that the timing of the spin will be either late this year, very late this year or early in Q1. Again, we're making very good progress in filings and separation agreements and all of that. So everything seems to be on target at this point.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Steve, I know you said that the VFC spin kind of prevents you from giving 2019 guidance at this point. But can you maybe just talk a little bit generally if you think about the Dental and Medical businesses in 2019? Would it be reasonable to expect higher or lower growth than what you're generating now? And any kind of early outlook on your ability to drive margin leverage next year in those two businesses? Thanks.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. There's really a lot of moving parts to providing guidance including the exact timing of the spin-off looking at the benefit that we will be receiving, we still haven't fully quantified all of our restructuring costs. There may be some offset in some stranded cost although we don't expect stranded cost to be material.","We're still negotiating the TSAs, the Transitional Services Agreement with SpinCo. So that will have some impact. I would say though we still feel with all of those and that's why we elected not to provide guidance because we (39:53) providing guidance. If this happens this is our guidance. If this is the timing, this is our guidance. And we thought, it would be too confusing to do that. So we're just going to wait a little bit longer until there's more clarity on that.","With respect to Dental and Medical, we still feel like the businesses are performing well. We feel like top line growth rates should be similar although we are looking at different initiatives as we've said a couple of times and ramping up growth in both our higher margin products and so things like the specialty businesses, things like technology and financial services. So the goal really is to get some margin expansion in next year's guidance. But again, it's premature and I don't want to give guidance before I'm giving guidance at this time.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","But to just follow-up on Steven's point here. It is this gap period until everything is settled down. The big thing is that we don't know when it begins. And we kind of know how many months after it begins it ends. So we're in this period now where we are finalizing putting to bed all the key items in this spin and we just need to settle down for a quarter or two. And then, I think you will see pretty good results. At least, we expect good results from the focus on the human side, medical and dental, prevention and wellness all those areas that we've articulated adding to the value-added service component and of course the higher margin areas in Dental and Medical. And I think on the other side of the ledger the Vets First Choice team are really also poised for good growth. So overall we're very optimistic.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe one quick follow-up. I believe the FTC hearing within Dental took place last month. Can you give us any update on what happened or maybe what the next steps will be in that dispute? Thank you.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure. Remember, there are no monetary damages being sought in the FTC dispute. The trial is still ongoing. It's hard to tell how long it will last, it could be weeks, it could be longer. But based on how the trial is going, we feel good about our comments that we feel like we've done nothing wrong. But we still have to wait through the process.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Stan, I guess, wanted to go back to the strong high-tech dental equipment growth you're seeing in the U.S. Wondering what's really driving that. Is it really the interoperability of the equipment and the new product offering? And then how sustainable is that growth that we're seeing?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","So it's a good question. And yes, you hit the nail on the head. I think \u2013 I don't want to go back to far in history but in 1990s we went to the dentists in this country and said what you want to do is put in a PC to help you run a more efficient practice. And we said to them about a decade later what you want to do is you want to put in electronic medical records to help you manage the clinical aspects of your practice more efficiently. And then, if you fast forward that and we went to the dentist about five or six years ago and said what you now want to do is digitalize your practice, change the flow so that you can replace analog with digital dentistry.","And my view is that our discussions with the dentists have gained credibility and that more and more dentists are understanding the importance. Of course, we're working with a number of manufacturers in this area that are aligning with Sirona \u2013 Dentsply Sirona in advancing the idea of interoperable digitalization of the practice is gaining momentum.","I still believe we're in early stages of this. I think, we'll gain even more momentum. First you've got the DI part that will continue to grow. And then the fully integrated system will also gain momentum.","One area that I think is not necessarily always understood by investors is the fact that this same exercise is taking place in parallel in the dental labs. And so there's a lot of opportunity there in the dental labs for the digitalization of the labs, interoperability between the labs and the dentists. And this is all an area that Henry Schein One is significantly focused on.","So I think the technology will advance. I think that the interoperability will advance. And the overall digital work stream will become far more understood, far simpler to use. And as with any technology advancement, will become part of the day-to-day operations of the practice.","We're not there yet. And there's probably 70% of dentists that still haven't begun this journey. And we think we're in the right position to help dentists advance in this journey of interoperable digital dentistry. And are very, very excited that this is a key strategy that we've put in place in our last strategic plan. We executed well and think that there's a huge opportunity for this strategic plan of 2018, 2019 and 2020 to advance on the strategy.","Very, very happy with our team and very happy with the attention we're getting in the marketplace, but actually think we're still pretty early in the game.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. That's very helpful, Stan. And then just wanted to switch over to the Animal Health business, kind of, wrapping a question in for Steve. Wondering if you're seeing any increased competition from kind of the online retailers? And any changes from the manufacturers?","And then on top of that, when you finish the Animal Health spin, can you remind us what the capital deployment strategy will be from the capital \u2013 the cash that you're going to get? What do you plan to do with it, Steve? Thanks.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure. So I would say that online players in Animal Health, as well as in other areas of our business, have been in the market. There really is no major changes in the market penetration. They still can't provide a lot of the services and value-add that we provide in Animal Health. So they're out there. But nothing really of a major change.","Similarly with manufacturers, I would say that while sometimes manufacturers flip from agency to traditional and vice versa, other than that, really no major changes in the major manufacturers' plans on Animal Health.","The last part of your question, so as part of the spin-off, SpinCo will pay a dividend of somewhere between $1 billion and $1.2 billion to Henry Schein. That dividend will be tax free for Henry Schein. So there is no taxes paid on it.","We'll use that money initially to pay down our revolving credit facility. There are some restrictions on what can be done with the money immediately. But once we pay down our existing debt, then all those restrictions go away. And we can use it for any purpose.","That dividend will allow Henry Schein to have a very strong balance sheet, probably slightly over one turn of debt to EBITDA.","And our capital allocation strategy will remain consistent with what you've seen. We'll continue to look to grow the business through strategic acquisitions. And we'll continue to look at opportunities for buying back our stock to return cash on a tax-advantaged way back to our shareholders.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Jonathan Block with Stifel.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe the first one just to circle back to North American Dental, you guys have done a really good job accelerating the North American consumable number to 4-and-change the past couple quarters.","Just looking forward, the comp gets more difficult entering 2019. Stanley or Steven, how do we think about that number longer term? I guess do you still think you've got the market share gains? And the market is on better footing where we can continue to see you post that 4% plus handle? Or is this somewhat the beneficiary of an easier comp that we've seen the past couple of quarters? And then I've got a follow-up.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","I'm not sure if it's directly related to the easier comp. I mean every quarter is slightly different. But generally, we're feeling pretty good about the consumable side of our business. I think our model, as we discussed at length in the conference call, of value-added services are really helping the practitioner operate a better business, so that they can provide better clinical care works.","The investment in our infrastructure, our e-commerce, Henry Schein One, and the training of our field sales consultants, all of that, I believe, adds to the value we bring to the marketplace and positions us to gain market share.","So we can't obviously predict with precision each quarter going forward. But what I think we're pretty comfortable with is that the market is growing slightly. And that we will add to that market growth a couple of hundred basis points each year. And that's sort of been our position for a while. And we remain confident with that, both growing in the small practices, the medium-sized practices, and the large practices.","Obviously, we're a bit more bullish \u2013 not a bit more, we're quite bullish on the specialty areas. Having said that, the specialty areas will not necessarily contribute to moving the needle significantly on sales, because it's relatively small compared to the entire consumable market but will drive margin as the specialty areas tend to be much more profitable and also will drive connectivity on the sale of equipment and software.","So, I think to answer your question, we are quite bullish still on the consumable side, in general consumables. I think there's a big opportunity for us in the specialty areas. These two combined with the value-added services, I think, will increase our overall sales of consumables, equipment, and yes, margin.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's a great color and actually a really good segue to my next one which is, you guys have talked recently about some of the company's initiatives for margin expansion. It looks like some of those may have already started to take hold. Your 3Q GMs were up versus the contraction we saw in the first part of the year. So Stanley, are we seeing that starting to flow through the P&L? Or the margin \u2013 the GM expansion that we saw specific to 3Q, is that more just the ebbs and the flows? I guess, are you feeling like some of the heavy lifting that the company started to do around gross margins are starting to take hold? Thanks, guys.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not sure if you could judge each quarter in a standalone segment. Having said that, we feel pretty comfortable that we will continue to drive gross margin, the Henry Schein One opportunity is helpful. The specialty areas are helpful. We made some acquisitions now, some one-time step-up in inventory.","If once that flushes through, I think the specialty areas will show increase margin as well on a consistent basis. And so I think and, in general, we are managing our margins as carefully as possible as we have done. So this all adds to margin management.","I think that you will see on the expense side also good management. Obviously, the restructuring is helping but at the same time we are investing in technology in the businesses. I don't think we are investing in massive ERP type investments.","Having said that, there are parts in Europe, where we are standardizing systems. We are adding a CRM in North America, upgrading what we have. There's a lot of investment going into e-commerce, we're making \u2013 we believe we have a very good website already in most countries but we are investing in that area. We've put in a new equipment sales and service system, quite expensive. It's almost installed, very expensive in terms of P&L cost but I think will be very profitable over time as the efficiencies increase in our equipment sales and service network.","And I think we will see some pay-off not only because the Henry Schein One margins are higher but because those margins increased as the cloud-based system becomes more popular. So I'm quite bullish about our margins, our gross margins and our ability to leverage a relatively fixed volume of business or a growing volume of business on the sales side with a relatively fixed cost infrastructure or reducing cost infrastructure. So you add all that stuff up and we remain quite comfortable that we can increase gross margins and operating margins. Taking all those factors into account.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question is from Steven Valiquette.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. So you guys highlighted the deals for the dental implant manufacturing asset towards the end of the quarter. Just curious at a high level if Henry Schein overall is making any strategic effort to increase the manufacturing asset mix in Dental and\/or Medical which may allow for just more pricing power versus peers, or do you just continue to look at each M&A opportunity on an individual basis without worrying too much about your distribution versus manufacturing mix? Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","We have been very clear as to when we invest in manufacturing. Our focus has been primarily on the specialty areas where our manufacturers have not given us access to lines. We began this process 14 years ago with investing in CAMLOG in advancement of the investment in BioHorizons with some other equipment properties.","Likewise on the orthodontic side and on the endodontic side. So there's lots and lots of opportunity on the specialty side in Dental. Similar opportunities although much earlier in the cycle on the Medical side. And those are the areas we plan on focusing on.","We will continue to advance our private brand, our generics if you will, but we'll be very circumspect about how we do that. Bottom line is, we have adequate \u2013 more than adequate sourcing of products and manufacturers are tending to work with us where we can help them grow market share and where manufacturers work with us and they see the value, there is no real reason to vertically integrate.","We'd rather have the manufacturers put the capital to use on the manufacturing and us advance the value-added services and market share for those manufacturers who want to work with us.","Having said that, when we cannot access a product, we will make it, whether it's a dental chair that we couldn't access some years back and we brought to market a dental equipment offering. We sold the business. There was no need for that.","We couldn't access scanners and digital equipment, aperture equipment. So invested in E4D when we took on the line, the Dentsply Sirona line, we were able to exit that market too. So generally it's a careful balancing of what we need, products we need with opportunities that manufacturers think to us, advancing our private brand with pricing is an issue. And so this is the kind of stuff we've been managing for decades and feel that we can balance the needs of everyone.","Our goal is to help those manufacturers that want to work with us succeed and at the same time make sure that every product that dentist may need or physician may need is available through Henry Schein.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just on the implant market overall right now, are you seeing big differences in growth rates in the market between the lower-priced generic implant growth versus the higher end branded? Is there a big dichotomy there right now in growth rates that you're seeing?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","The lower priced is growing in terms of units. But the upper end is doing well. We think that the value upper end is where we need to be. I will say that there are parts of the world where growth is faster, certainly in Asia, the developing world and say in parts of Europe. But setting aside the geographic variations, I would say generally, the higher priced implants where there's a lot more R&D and service behind the product line those are generally doing well. But the clones and the generics are growing and in certain markets slightly more in terms of units.","But overall, we believe the impact market, the bone regeneration market, the products around the implant and the equipment focused on the oral surgeon are all good markets and we are doing well. I believe we have the widest variety of products under one roof and we'll continue, I believe, to do very well in these markets.","This is a carefully thought-through strategy. There's been building blocks that we've built on for over a decade and pretty comfortable with this marketplace with our management team, we believe we have an excellent management team in this space and continue to be very, very excited about the oral surgery space.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we have reached the allotted time for questions and answers. Speakers, do you have any closing remarks?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Thank you very much everybody for calling in. We remain very, very optimistic about the future of Henry Schein, the morale in the company is very good. We have been able once again to develop a very solid strategy for this strategic plan almost one-third of the way through the plan, made some very significant moves.","The spin-off of VFC, the Henry Schein One creation, the investments in implants, efficiencies in our systems, adding appropriate senior management, middle management, entry level management where needed. I think the organization is finely tuned to continue to execute on our plans. And so we're very, very excited with where we are and where we're heading.","If anybody has any questions, please feel free to reach out to Carolynne Borders and Investor Relations, 631-390-8105. If you want to speak with Steven, Carolynne can connect you through. So thank you very much. And I'm not sure if we're going to any more investor conferences this year, so.","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","We'll be at Credit Suisse on November 13.","Stanley M.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Sylvia, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the second quarter of 2016. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 4, 2016.

This will provide the opportunity for as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour that we have allotted for this call.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Carolynne, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll provide further information, further color on our performance during the second quarter, expectations for the rest of the year, after Steven provides the specific information on our performance in the second quarter.","Generally, though, our North American dental sales were a little bit below our expectations in the second quarter. However, sales in our Medical, Animal Health, Technology, Value-Added Services businesses was strong, as well as in aspects of our North American dental business. And we will again provide further color on specifics after you have the details from Steven.","Over the years, our business has been quite predictable and, as an organization, Henry Schein has been able to adapt, seize opportunities and address challenges. We believe that our business model and strategic plan, including our continued investments, will drive our growth over the long term and in fact in the medium term. And we remain extremely well-positioned in each of our vertical markets we serve, not only to gain market share, but of course to manage our investments very carefully. We have a seasoned management team that is very good at these points and particularly at gaining market share and managing our investments in a very strategic way.","On a granular level, looking at plans for the UK to leave the European Union, they're on a very early stage, which is likely to be a two-year process, many say not much starts until early next year. Surely, there will be developments along the way, but let me be clear that Henry Schein's commitment to the UK remains unchanged and so does our commitment to the European Union. We continue to believe that the UK and Europe on the whole represent attractive long-term opportunities in both our Dental and Animal Health businesses and perhaps even in our Medical business in the long term. We expect to continue to execute well in our value-added custom approach, just as we did before the Brexit vote.","In a moment, I'll provide, as I said, an additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments, but first Steven will review the specifics around our financial results.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 second quarter results include a favorable proposed tax settlement of $4.5 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Q2 2016 results also include restructuring costs of $20.4 million pre-tax or $0.18 per diluted share. Our prior year Q2 2015 results also include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pre-tax or $0.06 per diluted share.","I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes those restructuring costs, as we believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparisons of financial results between periods were certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see our Exhibit B to this morning's earnings release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.","So turning to our results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 25, 2016 were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. This consisted of 9.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 7.6% and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.1%.","Also, when further normalizing the switches between agency and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for the company for Q2 was 5.8%. You can see the details of our sales growth that are also contained in today's earnings news release on Exhibit A.","If you look at the operating margin on a GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2016, it was 6.3% and contracted 67 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015. The increase in restructuring costs in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year negatively impacted the contraction by 43 basis points. Acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses as well as the switches from agency to direct sales also combined to negatively impact our contraction by 9 basis points. The remaining contraction was primarily driven by lower than expected sales growth in our North American Dental business relative to our other businesses. As a result of this, we have extended our restructuring period to the end of 2016 in order to continue to reduce our cost structure.","Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, our effective tax rate was 27.4%. This compares with an adjusted effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs.","As I mentioned earlier, our tax rate this quarter reflects approximately $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable proposed tax element. We also expect the settlement to reduce our ongoing effective tax rate going forward. More specifically, we anticipate that our effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the 29% range for the remainder of the year. And previously we had guided that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the 30% range.","If we look at net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis, it was $120.1 million or $1.46 per diluted share, representing increases of 1.8% and 4.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, our adjusted net income attributable to Henry Schein was $135.4 million or $1.64 per diluted share and that represents increases of 9.9% and 12.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year.","Foreign exchange impact on diluted EPS for the quarter was not material. I'd also like to note that at current exchange rates, we expect the foreign exchange translation of our outside of the U.S. earnings to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half of the year by at least $0.02 per diluted share, and that's related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound sterling.","Let me now provide some detail on sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the second quarter of 2016 increased 4% to $1.4 billion. This consisted of 4.1% growth in constant currencies and a small 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.8% and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.3%. Our North American internal growth in constant currencies was 2%, and it included 1.8% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 2.7% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue.","As we noted in our press release, our Q2 Dental sales in North America reflect softness that began in early June. Our performance was also impacted by a decision to stop selling certain precious metals products. These products have a very low gross margin and are relatively immaterial to our profitability. Precious metals sales negatively impacted our North American dental merchandise sales growth in Q2 by approximately 50 basis points. So, again, our growth would be 50 basis points higher without the decision to stop selling precious metals. This will continue to impact our merchandise sales growth until it annualizes, so it will continue for the next three quarters.","As Stanley mentioned, we are extremely well-positioned among our dental customers and we will continue to invest in opportunities that we believe will drive our growth over the long term. Looking at international internal growth in local currencies, our Dental group was 4.2% growth and included 4.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 3.1% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenues. That growth internationally was driven specifically by Italy, France and Spain, to a large extent.","Animal Health sales were $853.6 million in the second quarter, that was an increase of 14%. This included growth of 15.2% in local currencies and a decline of 1.2% related to foreign currency exchange.","Our internal sales in local currencies grew 11.8% and acquisitions contributed an additional 3.4% to our growth. Looking at the North American Animal Health sales, internal sales growth in constant currencies was 18.8%. And when normalized in the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales, our growth was 11.4% in North America.","We believe this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reduction \u2013 sorry, I mean, more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business, and also reflects the strength of a broader animal health market. Our international Animal Health sales growth internally in constant currencies was 4.9%.","Looking at our Medical group, our Medical sales were $538.8 million in the second quarter and that was an increase of 14.4%. Foreign exchange had virtually no impact on our sales growth. That 14.5% growth included 14.9% growth in North America and 2.4% growth in local currencies internationally. Again, when normalizing for the impact of agency sales in the prior year, North American internal growth was 10.4%. And this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains for our North American Medical business. So indeed, we have been outperforming the medical market by a fairly significant margin for the past six quarters, and we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards larger group practices, including IDNs, or Integrated Delivery Networks.","Our Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $107 million for the quarter, representing a 19.6% growth. This included 20.4% growth in constant currencies and a 0.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated growth was 8.1% and acquisitions contributed an additional 12.3%. The 8.1% internal growth in local currencies included 8.5% growth in North America and 6.4% growth internationally.","I'd like to highlight that our North American sales growth included more than 20% growth in our Financial Services business. Our Financial Services business includes equipment and practice financing, credit card processing, practice brokerage, and patient collections as well as other services.","Our core software products and upgrades of Technology and Value-Added Services businesses also aims to provide customers with solutions that are efficient and patient friendly, allowing them to generate more business, manage content among multiple sites and improve the overall practice management.","During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. More specifically, we purchased 337,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $169.41 and that represented about $57 million. The impact on the current quarter of that purchase was immaterial to our EPS. I think it's important to note that, at the close of the quarter we had approximately $243 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock, and we continue to believe that our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activity will continue to drive increased shareholder value.","If we look at some brief highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million compared to $207 million in the prior year, and we believe we'll continue to have strong operating cash flow for the year.","Accounts receivable days outstanding was 40.8 days this quarter, compares to 39.3 days last year. Inventory turns for the quarter were 5.6 turns and that compares to 5.8 turns last year.","Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our 2016 financial guidance. We are revising our guidance due to the impact of a number of factors. These factors include the ongoing business and economic uncertainty related to the Brexit vote, which would have a potential impact on the UK as well as the rest of Europe.","As noted earlier, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the pound sterling at current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half by at least $0.02, and this new guidance also includes a cautious view of the North American dental market.","So for 2016, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $6.55 to $6.60, which represents growth of 10% to 11% compared with the 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.96. All of these adjusted diluted EPS numbers exclude restructuring costs, and this compares to our previous guidance, which was $6.55 to $6.65.","Our guidance is presented on a non-GAAP basis only, given that the company cannot reasonably project a restructuring cost that we expect to incur in the second half of 2016. For the same reason, the company is unable to address the probable significance of that information.","Our guidance for 2016, adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is as always for continuing operations, as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions, as well as restructuring costs.","We now anticipate that the restructuring initiatives will continue into the second half of the year, as we continue to reduce our operating costs in light of some of these market conditions. At this time, again we're not able to provide estimates for this impact in our 2016 financial results.","Specifically, for Q3, we expect our growth in adjusted diluted EPS, again excluding restructuring cost, to be in the mid-single digits, so mid-single digit growth for Q3, but we obviously expect the growth to accelerate in Q4.","This guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels as of now. However, we do believe that there's a possibility that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen; and remember that 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.","Also, I'd like to conclude by mentioning that our fourth quarter results, since we're on a 52-week, 53-week basis, ending on the last Saturday of December, include an extra week. So 2016 consists of 53 weeks. The extra week is in Q4 of 2006 (sic) [2016] (20:03) and it's the last week of our fiscal year, which is the holiday week at the end of the year. So, sales are typically lower during that week, and we typically don't have the same level of profitability because of fixed costs remaining relatively constant.","So with that, I'd like to now turn the call back to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our four business groups with Dental. As Steve noted, North America Dental sales were impacted by softness in the U.S. that began in early June. We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and our commitment to delivering value to their practices will continue to be key to our long-term success. And as in the past, it'll enable us to continue to gain market share not only in the United States, but globally in the dental markets.","Although the sales growth was lower than expected in the second quarter, we believe we have a proven and successful model of delivering value-added solutions to our customers and we have increased our focus on delivering better sales results in the short term.","As evidence of this commitment, during our second quarter, we announced an investment in Custom Automated Prosthetics, known as CAP. CAP is a U.S. digital laboratory supply company with 2015 sales of approximately $30 million. They offer CAD\/CAM equipment as well as a full line of zirconia materials, the integration of CAP with Zahn, which is our dental laboratory business, and our Custom Milling Center furthers our commitment to providing dental laboratory customers with a greater selection of digital equipment, materials and services. We believe these products will help them, our laboratory customers, to navigate through the important digital transition that is occurring in the dental technology space today, and I might add, at a rapid pace.","Further supporting our commitment to advanced technology and to help prepare the next generation of dental professionals for advances in digital dentistry, in May we announced the opening of the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry program at Temple University's Kornberg School of Dentistry.","Technology advancements are affecting almost every aspect of the practice of dentistry, and we are committed not only to bringing those advancements to our customers, but also to making sure our current and future customers are well versed in all aspects of running an efficient and profitable practice, while allowing for high-quality patient care. Dental students and faculty at Temple University now have access to the latest 3D imaging equipment, intraoral scanners and milling machines made available as a result of this partnership.","Regarding our digital dentistry efforts, we continue to see strong growth in sales of digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. The breadth of our product offering is reflective of our belief that customers want choice and open architecture for their restorative dentistry needs. This also creates an opportunity for follow-on software and mill sales, when these dental practices are ready to move to a full scale in our systems. With Zahn Dental and CAP, we continue to be well positioned to provide innovative solutions to the lab market for restorations that are outsourced from the practice.","Let me just add that in North America, CAD\/CAM sales were strong in the second quarter, driven by digital scanner sales, while our traditional equipment sales was soft; and I might add partially due to timing.","Lastly, I'd like to comment on a recent change in our Global Dental Surgical Group. As of June, BioHorizons has become the exclusive distributor of CAMLOG branded products in the United States and Canada. This creates a unified sales force in the U.S. for compete dental offerings to specialists and general practitioners. By combining the two sales forces for these high quality complementary brands we're creating a more efficient go-to-market strategy, giving our customers access to a greater selection of products and services from high-quality branded to high-quality economy implants with a wide variety of clinical base products.","It also will afford more robust North American coverage in strengthening our position to effectively compete and grow our market share in, as I said, the premium and value-added segments of the dental implant market. We look forward to continued success in this important segment. These businesses are and actually have been doing quite well for a while.","Now let me turn and, of course, happy to answer more questions on the Dental side during the rest of the call. On the Animal Health side, as Steven mentioned, when normalizing for Animal Health results, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.4% in North America, reflective of a healthy market, but also reflective of market share gains. We have been gaining market share in North America in the animal health arena for a while now.","International currency sales during the second quarter were up 12%, with organic growth complemented by acquisition growth. We are making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio, targeting practices that are nearing the end of the instrument lease agreements as well as growing clinics with a need for multiple systems for high volume testing. Indeed, sales of diagnostic products in North America grew in the low-double digits in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. We believe this is ahead of the market growth in this sector.","Axis-Q continues to be an attractive element of our sales proposals as customers see strong benefits in efficiently linking their practice management software with their diagnostic instruments. This is a holistic approach. It's not selling devices nor is it selling software; it's the interoperability of devices and software connected to the practice management system, the clinical workstation. As a reminder, Henry Schein's practice management software is today used by more than 50% of the U.S. veterinary practices. Again, strategy here in the animal health space is doing very well, well thought out and being well executed, of course, not only in the U.S., but throughout the world in the animal health arena where Henry Schein is in fact active.","Let me now turn to Medical. The reported growth in our Medical group of 14.5% was impacted by agency sales in the prior year. When normalizing for this impact, the core internal growth for North America Medical was 10.4%, as Steven mentioned. And let me stress, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gain. We continued to see solid growth from large group practices, including IDNs, the integrated delivery networks, as we onboard new customer wins from the past year. These are internal growth wins that we've been working on for a while and that are bearing fruit.","In addition, the expansion of large health systems with which we have built strong relationships over the past several years is contributing to our growth. Our focus on the ambulatory surgery center segment of the market is yielding solid results as well, as we are seeing strong sales in the sector. And our teams are making inroads with our smaller market segments, including universities and sports medicine, where we have a growing base of customers who rely on our broad value-added service model.","Now, let me talk about the Technology and Value-Added Services group. We are pleased, again, with the second quarter performance of this business group. North American Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 8.5% in local currencies, matched the highest growth rate in more than three years. Strategic acquisitions that bolstered our market share in this business as sales in local currencies increased by more than 21% in North America during second quarter and by nearly 15% internationally. Of course, we are very pleased with these results as reported to the P&Ls of these businesses. But let me remind our investors that, in fact, it's the stickiness, the value-added services, that our Practice Solutions group brings to bear in our customer base that has the real strategic value.","Enhancing digital platforms across the businesses we serve is an important priority for Henry Schein, in fact, one of our largest and perhaps most important priority. We provide a means for our customers to better connect with their patients and improve overall efficiencies, thereby reinforcing our value to their practices and, in fact, allowing our customers to show their value to their patients. And we continue to develop innovative solutions to drive interoperability with devices and, of course, the cloud to manage workflows.","We are very, very pleased with the progress we've made specifically on our cloud-based dental product and the connection between our practice management software and the devices in the dental space, whether it is in the imaging area or in the prosthetics area, likewise, as I reported earlier on, in the animal health space with our diagnostic and imaging product offerings that are connected so well to our practice management software, which will only get better over time.","So as you may know, 2015 was a special year for Henry Schein as we marked 20 years as a public traded company. In May, we had the opportunity to celebrate this milestone as we opened trading at the NASDAQ Stock Market. 20 years ago we had a vision for what Henry Schein could become. Since then, more and more people have joined us in sharing that vision, in building our company and expanding our presence in the global markets we serve. And all the while we have demonstrated we can successfully serve shareholders while also serving society and, of course, our suppliers and our customers and the team.","We are pleased to have accomplished so much as a result of the hard work of the team Schein members across the globe over the past 20 years since we've been public. We continue to be most optimistic about our strategies. We're unwavering in executing our strategic plan, which revolves around the notion of helping practitioners operate a more efficient practice while providing better clinical care. We feel that we have the right strategies and the tactics in place, and we'll of course make sure that we manage our expenses in a way that delivers on our commitments to our shareholders.","Lastly, we are pleased to announce that in June Henry Schein moved up the number 268 in the ranking the Fortune 500, celebrating our 13th year as one of the America's largest corporations. This is testament to more than 19,000 team Schein members throughout the world who are dedicated to helping our customers build better practices so that can provide better quality care. We, of course, have been on the list of the Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the entire period.","So, with that commentary and an overview of our quarterly results from both the financial and operating performance point of view, we thank you for your attention and we're of close ready to answer any questions that shareholders may have.","Carolynne Borders - Vice President-Investor Relations","Sylvia, can you open the Q&A, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Yes, very well.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Steve, I guess or Stanley, I guess it's a question for either of you. But I'm having a little trouble reconciling I guess a couple of things. And one is that, you're having some very solid performance in the Vet and the Medical side, probably better than we expected or better than you expected, but better than we expected. Dental's soft, but if I back out that little bit of precious metals, consumables still growing north of 2%. So, no big disaster there.","But, Steve, when I look at your guidance, you're taking it down a nickel at the top, another nickel if I adjust for the tax rate, updates you provided today, it just seems like it's a pretty sizable take down in guidance of $0.05 to $0.10, I'm sorry, at the top-line, when there's strength elsewhere in the business. And I just can't understand, maybe, how sizable that change was on the Dental side in the last month or two in what you've been seeing?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Well, there's a couple of things. Remember, we do want to be cautious on the conservative side in our guidance. As we've said, in the U.S. Dental, we saw a slowness of sales that began in June, and while we're not convinced that this is a long-term permanent impact, we do want to make sure that if it continues for a little while that our guidance is sustainable. We do have foreign exchange headwinds. We do expect, although we haven't seen much impact right now in the UK, we do expect that the UK market will soften, and as you probably know, about 8% of our revenues are in the UK market between Dental and Animal Health.","We also because, I know you know this also, but when you look at profitability, our U.S. Dental on a distribution business is our most profitable business, so we have a mix issue on profitability where the most profitable business is growing the slowest; and while Medical and Animal Health are nicely profitable, they're just not as profitable. So, there's a lot of things going on, Jeff, and we just feel that right now, given that we were not expecting this June sales slowdown, is the time to be a little bit cautious in the market. So, hopefully, that helps you a little bit.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That does. And maybe just one follow up then is, it sounds like July really hasn't bounced back, right, assume it hasn't if you're taking the guidance down the way you are. And then I know you don't give segment specific operating margin details, but just qualitatively within Medical, are those margins holding steady? Is Dental margin itself coming down or is the 9 basis points, 10 basis points of operating margin contraction we saw this quarter, once we adjust for all the moving parts you talked about, is that 10 basis point contraction, just mix driven more than anything? Thank you.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Okay. Yeah, it is primarily mix driven. We did not see a significant rebound in U.S. Dental sales in July, consumable sales. It's really right now continuing at similar rates to Q2. On the other hand, equipment, we did see an increase in equipment demand, our backlog is very strong and increasing on equipment. We do expect an uptick, a modest uptick, in consumable sales in the U.S., but again, we're trying to be cautious. And I'd like to point out, when you look at our margin, look at the components of our margin, for the quarter, excluding restructuring costs, our operating expenses are down 35 basis points versus the prior year. And if you exclude the acquisitions in the last 12 months, operating expenses are actually down 55 basis points.","So, our restructuring activities are making us more efficient, but on the gross margin level, Dental consumable sales for distribution are our highest gross margin business. So, again, we're trying to be cautious in the market, and a little bit conservative. And so we need more data points in the future in order to be able to talk about what we're seeing for a longer term in the market.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steven. Just, let me just add a little bit more flavor. First of all, there is no IMS data, as we've said, over the past in dentistry, but it's our view that essentially from a unit's point of view, the market is flat. It's not going down, it's not going up, talking about the U.S. consumable market. And we think that the market is growing at about 2%, which is essentially price increases. We've now \u2013 there is an independent market data product out there, it's not accurate, but it does show a modest sequential downturn, and it is more or less accurate directionally. But two months is not a statistically valid view of that market from our point of view.","We've also spoken to several key manufacturers who support this view that the consumable business in the U.S. is essentially flat, with a couple of hundred basis points of inflation. So, we're talking about 100 basis points, 80 basis points margin of error; it's very, very small. And in that context, we believe we are still gaining market share and have gained market share consistently for a while. We hear this from most of the major if not all the major manufacturers.","So, we wanted to take a cautious view. I'd be quick to say that our demand for equipment is good. One of our key manufacturers was delayed a little bit in the second quarter with providing equipment, a new system which we had taken a lot of orders for. We believe that that equipment will be delivered in time for the third quarter. So we're looking at a much better second quarter, but within these hundreds of basis points this way, that way we want to be on the cautious side.","I also mentioned earlier on, that we're doing quite well with CAD\/CAM sales, particularly with scanners. So we have to be careful not to be too negative, but also want to be cautious here. And, yes, our Medical, our Animal Health, our Oral Surgery, our Dental specialty businesses in general remain solid. In fact, our Corporate Accounts business, our Special Markets business in dentistry is actually doing quite well and so is the mid-market.","The area where we just can't put our finger on right now is what's happening to the smaller Main Street dentists in the U.S. And again, overall, we do see that we're gaining market share in this country and abroad and in all of our businesses. We don't see any area on the strategic side that we want to moderate or change; perhaps we want to advance the Solutions business, leading with software a little bit faster. But overall, I think, Steven is right to be on the cautious side, and we want to reduce the top end a bit of our guidance.","So, it's really cautionary, indicative of these numerous areas that may be slightly questionable, including the economy, in this country and in Europe. We're actually quite comfortable that we will deliver good results in the end in Europe, but the economy in Europe is out of our control. So that's why we'd like to be a little bit more cautious and also control our expenses a little bit more carefully.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Stan, maybe just a follow-up on that same theme. How did some of your specialty products do across dentistry versus more of your typical preventive and restorative? So, for example, how does your implants do in the U.S. and Europe?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, our implant business in general, John is doing okay. And again, we want to be careful about not creating expectations that we're going to report monthly sales on an ongoing basis. But because of this particular situation, I must say, it caught us a little bit by surprise heading into our Dental National Sales Meeting in June. It is possible that a little bit of a downtick occurred because our entire sales force was out of the field for a while.","But to answer that question directly, April and May were pretty good in the implant business. June was a challenge, but it would appear that July bounced back. But again, John, we're talking within a hundreds of basis points both sides, not even hundreds, 100 or so basis points both sides. So I'm not sure if this is conclusive on the downside or conclusive on the upside. I will say the U.S. implant market is quite strong; we're comfortable with the European markets for implants.","But on the margin, our implant business has been driven by few countries, not Henry Schein on the ground, but through distribution agents in countries like Russia and Turkey and even Japan. And these are markets that have been very helpful, again driving within 100 basis points here or there growth. But we're a little cautious about these markets. Having said that, let me quickly remind that we are quite comfortable with our two big markets for BioHorizons, the U.S., Canada, and for CAMLOG Germany and the Duc (44:49) region.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then one quick follow-up, the trends that you've been talking about over the last few minutes in June in particular, did you see that kind of consistently across your various SKU within consumables? Or were they kind of isolated to certain ones that might suggest this is a volume issue or more of a kind of spending-per-visit issue? Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a good question. You can imagine, to quote one of our finance people, we've been torturing numbers, and really we cannot come up with anything 100% conclusive. What we've told you is what we believe. And I think we don't want to create the precedent of having to go into this detail every quarter. But because of this unusual situation that occurred in June, we felt we should provide a little more information. But there are clusters leading one way, but there are clusters going the other way.","And it's really very hard to come up with anything conclusive other than to say that this particular survey, this independent market survey, does show modest sequential downturn, but it's only good from a directional point of view and manufacturers have given us this view. But I have to tell you, there are manufacturers that have shown us that business has been good. And for those \u2013 and I would say more or less across the board, Henry Schein has been gaining \u2013 continuously gained market share. And again I'm talking about consumables, because I think the equipment business is quite sound, especially in the digital space, whether it's the digital imaging or digital prosthetics.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. And good morning. I'll try to ask two. The first one just the delta in growth between North America Animal Health and Dental is significant. You got Animal Health growing about 11% adjusted, Dental consumables 2% to 2.5%. So, Stanley, can you talk to the consumer and why you think we're seeing this divergence in these two industries and is this sustainable? In other words, can you have this, call it, 900 basis point delta in growth between what are essentially two consumer-driven industries? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jon, that is probably the number-one vexing question we have. The animal health market is doing well, yet we are doing better than the market both here and in Europe. But it is doing well, it's alive and well. We saw similar things, and I don't want to draw any more analogy to what I'm about to say than just the narrow point I'm going to make, don't read any trends into this. But in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Animal Health, in most of those quarters did better than Dental. But I don't want to come to any conclusions because there are a lot of other factors in Dental, insurance. We have to also remember I think we may have gotten a false positive in the first quarter. We saw growth was significant on consumables and that may have been due to weather.","I think the dental market in the United States has been more or less flat for a while and driven a little bit by inflation and also perhaps visits to implant dentists a little bit more. But, again, we're in a few hundred basis points here in Dental and it's hard to gauge what is happening specifically within that range. Having said that, the animal health market is a healthy market around the world, driven by the middle class and, as we've said before many times, the baby boomers. They're buying more pets.","Again, I'm not really speaking on behalf of the agri side of it, the production side, which has its own dynamics related to the milk price, the meat price. But Henry Schein is not a big player in that space, with the exception of a few markets like Ireland or New Zealand, where we are in the dairy field, and in couple of markets, Australia and parts of Europe, where we have some production. But from the pet point of view, it's growing. The demand for pets is growing and people are spending more money. We've seen that with our customers, both the customer that is public and the customers that are not public. It's a hot space, it's a good space. And I would say the medical space in good, too, but it's not driven by consumer issues on the medical side. It's driven by a realignment in the way in which healthcare is provided.","Obviously, we've shown very good results on the Medical side for the past six quarters, but obviously it's not sustainable at that high level, although we remain very optimistic in our ability to gain market share. And the foot traffic in to the medical office is not really as important as us gaining bigger accounts.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Perfect. That was very helpful. And, Steven, one for you. Your third quarter commentary around mid-single digit earnings growth implies around $1.90 or low to mid-teen EPS growth for 4Q. So can you just talk to your level of confidence on that reacceleration? Does that assume any snapback from a top-line perspective, or is it just the easy year-ago comp in 4Q and some of the restructuring initiatives taking hold? Thanks, guys.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Yeah. Jon. So for Q3, the first important thing is Q3 was a difficult comp on an EPS level and an easier comp in Q4. And specifically, Q3 of last year had 15.7% EPS growth. So it is a more difficult comp. So that's one thing.","Some of things that we talked about, cautious view of dental market in the U.S., Brexit, foreign exchange, but there's also timing of expenses between Q3 and Q4. There's also further restructuring activities, which will only have a modest impact in Q3 and have a greater impact in Q4. And lastly, a potential for flu vaccine sales timing that could be a little bit negative for us. But the biggest reason, I gave you a laundry list, but the biggest reason is that 15.7% EPS growth last year's third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. And just hate to go back to this, but on the North American dental market, I wanted to hone in a little bit on the merchandise side. Obviously, must have really fallen off in June based on your commentary. I'm curious, is there anything you could elaborate on or share with us relative to the competitive environment? Did you see any changes in behavior from your traditional competitors in the way that they're approaching their go-to-market strategy? Did you see any increased pressure from alternative distribution channels, like online pure play competitors?","Just anything that might help us get our heads around what seemingly was a pretty consistent growth until May and then obviously, based on the numbers you've shared, seems like a fairly dramatic pullback in June, would be helpful.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, Bob, let me stress that this is not the first time we've seen this. Even in the last three years, four years, five years, we do periodically have a month or two months with a challenge. What happened here is that we had an extremely good April and May, and we didn't expect it to fall off this much. So that's number one.","Number two is, I don't think there's any major that changed dynamics on the competitive side. It is a competitive market to be sure. There's no shortage of competitors. Everybody is fighting for that last dollar. So it is a competitive market.","Having said that, we do own some brands in the discount area and they did not see any real change in dynamics. Their trending is more or less the same as ours. We have those interests in those businesses just so we can keep an eye on what's going on on that side. By the way, we do this not only in the U.S., but throughout the world. And we don't see any major change in the competitive pressures.","In fact, on the contrary. We see equipment doing quite well and practitioners investing specifically on the digital side. So what we said is what we know and we don't normally go this deep into it, but given this change, we felt we should be more explicit. And I can't nor can Jim Breslawski the President of Henry Schein, the CEO of our Dental business, nor could he point to anything specific on the competitive side.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Yeah. And just to add to that, based on the data that we have, we don't see any share shifts of any magnitude that we can reasonably comment on. So, we don't think that our share really changed dramatically during this period. We think the biggest issue is we just had a soft Q in market.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the share gain, directionally, I think we continue to gain share. And this seems to be an issue with the very small practices and, yes the very large ones seem to be growing a little bit and the mid-market ones are growing quite substantially. But the little ones are struggling a bit, at least from a June point of view. I would not take that and extrapolate and say, the smaller practices are having problems, but it seems that in this particular two months' cycle there was a challenge there.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And then just one quick follow-up. You guys mentioned that you're spending the restructuring program beyond this year. Can you remind us how much of the current program has reduced the cost base so far? And then how will the extended program compare to the details you shared around the initial program?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Okay. Again, on the previous call, I highlighted some of that. For the current quarter, excluding restructuring portion of the core operating expenses and excluding acquisitions that were done within 12 months, because they just changed the base, we took down operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 55 basis points. So we're looking to do more. Right now, we're still determining exactly what additional restructuring activities should be executed on, and that's why we can't give an estimate for how much the additional restructurings are, because we haven't finalized that. But we do expect to take operating expenses down even further, again to reflect this more cautious view. And there's opportunities there for us. But it's really difficult to pinpoint that at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Larsen from Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, can you talk a bit about the Medical division. It looks like the growth rate was very in the quarter, but it seems like it did decelerated a little bit sequentially. How's the relationship with Cardinal and how are trends in that space? Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, David, I think we've mentioned in the last couple of calls that the sales in Medical to some extent is to a large extent dependent upon bringing on these larger accounts, and they come onboard in a lumpy way. So we brought a lot of these accounts onboard in the last two years. It's obviously not sustainable at these phenomenal rates, because the market is not growing by these rates. The market probably, and there's no specific data, is growing by a couple of hundred basis points and definitely not because of inflation, because pricing is moving from branded to generics on the pharmaceutical side and on the MedSurg side.","So, we've had very healthy growth in this area, organic. We are growing on top of that. So I would repeat what we said in previous calls, that we are gaining market share. I think we're gaining very nicely on the market share side organically. Of course, the Cardinal acquisition did help, but organically, I think that's where the impetus is coming from.","So I'm not sure, as I said in my \u2013 I think in the prepared remarks, that these double-digit growth numbers are sustainable in Medical, but we will grow at a multiple of the markets. And we will increase our profits in this area as we drive more profitable mix in products in this area. We're very happy with our Medical business.","Now on the Cardinal side, the integration of the Cardinal Health physician office business is substantially complete, and we have received positive feedback from the acquired customer base. There's a lot of change going on in healthcare and we are in the process of modifying our purchase commitment to Cardinal to reflect the rapidly changing environment that makes more business sense from both of our points of view. We're creating greater flexibility in our relationship with Cardinal, specifically around the integrated delivery networks. They are better at servicing aspects of the IDN and we are better at servicing other aspects of the IDN.","So we are modifying the marketing arrangement with Cardinal. And there are certain products that doesn't make sense for us to buy from Cardinal as they have very good procurement pricing as it relates to hospitals. But the demand for choice in the physician market is much greater than in the hospital where formularies can be mandated and not so much mandated in the physician space, and even in large group practices.","So, we're modifying this thinking right now with Cardinal, but I would say, our internal growth is pretty good in this physician space, arguably the best of all the players, the bigger players. And we're very optimistic about this business and actually optimistic about the strategic direction we can take this business in over the next five years.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. And your final question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. I was wondering if you could give us any updated thoughts on, in terms of the M&A pipeline and in terms of valuation or technologies that you guys are looking at?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say that on the M&A side, we very rarely participate in books that are put out. We have bought some companies where a book has been put out, for example, BioHorizons. But generally, our deals are known well in advance before they're close. It's usually a family company, a private equity firm that understands we're the best buyer. And so really, yeah, I think prices are higher in that segment than they were before, because interest rates are lower. But we don't participate really in the bubble pricing where you are seeing crazy multiples on some deals because private equity has a lot of money on the sideline and because interest rates are low.","Our deals are deals that are carved out for specific strategic reasons, a family wants us to buy 80%, somebody wants to stay a partner once the merger does bring their product to our channels. And I would say, we have no shortage of deals; our pipeline is pretty good. And I think we're still on line with putting to work, I think, what is it, $200 million, $220 million, $250 million...?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Yeah.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sometimes as much as $300 million, but I doubt, less than $200 million a year. These kinds of deals in the end are expensive in the first year from a P&L point of view, because you've got all the deal cuffs (62:18), sometimes you have software amortization that has to be picked up in first year or inventory adjustments, but in the second year or so that become very profitable.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great. And I guess as a follow-up, my other question is, have you seen any changes in the large practice dental market in terms of increased competitiveness there, anything like that? I know that some of your competitors have been saying that they're looking more closely at that end of the market. Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. There's always increased competition. There's no shortage of suppliers that would like to take these accounts. And we believe that we have very good value-added services. Of course, we will lose an account from time-to-time. But I think in the end, we've shown that we can gain more accounts than lose them, especially those that are centrally managed, that are formulary driven. I think our knowledge from the Medical space, which was introduced into the Animal Health space and into Dental, stands us in good stead. But, yes, there's obviously increased competition. To my knowledge, there's been increased competition over the past decade almost. And I think we're doing okay and we are building more and more value-added services, that's the nature of the free market.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So thank you, everyone, for calling in. We're, of course, very bullish about the future of Henry Schein; nothing has changed there. We have a good strategic plan. We start in January of 2017 working on the strategic plan for 2018, 2019 and 2020. I'm sure that will result in allocation, reallocation of resources, as you would expect. But overall, we're very pleased with the direction, the longer-term results.","Sometimes one business is ahead of another; that's the nature of business. Sometimes you have a challenge here and you've a challenge there and you have a plus here and a plus there. We have a great management team, a team in the organization that is highly motivated and ready for even more competition. And so, we remain very, very excited about where we are and the opportunity for the future.","If anybody has further questions, please contact Carolynne Borders at 631-390-8105. And thank you for your participation, and look forward to speaking with our investor community again in 90 days. I believe Steven, and I'm not sure about myself, but I know Steven will be at investor conferences over the next 90 days, and certainly are ready to speak about any questions that you may have in the form of clarification of information already disclosed.

Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, Hallie. And thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2019 first quarter. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the precautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end-market growth rates and market share are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.","Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods for certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by Management in our operating of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the supplemental info of our Investor Relations website.","The content of this call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast May 7, 2019. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up during Q&A.","And with that said, I would like to turn the call over to, Stan Bergman.","Stanley Bergman","Good morning. Thank you, Carolynne, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to announce record first quarter financial results from continuing operations.","Internally generated sales growth in local currencies was 4.3% and EPS growth from continuing operations was approximately 8% on both the GAAP, the non-GAAP basis. We are also raising the top end of our guidance for 2019 on a non-GAAP financial guidance range basis. We are pleased with our performance to date as we execute on our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan. We have completed the first quarter of what we have characterized as 2019 transition year as we continue to separate operations of our former Animal Health business. Throughout this transition we believe we gained market share in both of our Global Dental and Medical businesses and we are quite confident that Henry Schein is well positioned and believe, actually, continues to be well positioned for operational success over the long term.","Our focus remains on supporting our customers around the world with the broadest array of products and services, along with innovative technology that expands our value-added solutions offering while pursuing new investment opportunities. So it's about inorganic growth, organic growth by helping our customers operate a more efficient practice so that they on their end can provide better quality care to the public. We are very excited about the opportunities we have to continue to grow our business on a global basis through our investments in scale and innovation.","So at this time, let me ask Steven to review our financial results and guidance and then I'll provide some additional commentary on the recent business performance and accomplishments. Please, Steven.","Steven Paladino","Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations on an as-reported GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q1 2019 and Q1 2018 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release. And that is available on our Investor Relations section of our website.","Please also note that this quarter we have included a new corporate sales category that represents product sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreement entered into in connection with the animal health spin off that was completed in February 2019. We expect these sales to Covetrus to continue into the first half of 2020 and we note that because these are low-margin sales that have little impact on our operating income. For fiscal 2019, we expect those corporate revenues to total approximately $100 million. Also, please note that we adopted the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter. As a result, our Q1 balance sheet includes additional lease assets of $248 million and lease liabilities of $256 million. The new standard did not materially impact our consolidated net income and had no impact on our cash flows.","Turning to our Q1 results, net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 were $2.4 billion, reflecting a 3.8% increase compared with the first quarter of 2018, with internally-generated sales growth in local currencies of 4.3%. When excluding those product sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreements, internal sales growth in local currencies was to be 3.7%. Please note that the details of our sales growth are contained in Exhibit A in our earnings news release issued today.","On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 7.3% and improved by 17 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2018. On a non-GAAP basis which excludes restructuring costs, our operating margin was 7.5% and expanded by 25 basis points on a year-over-year basis. You can also find a reconciliation of our GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income in the supplemental info page on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Turning to taxes, our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 24.6%. This compares with 24.4% GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 25.4% and compared with the prior year non-GAAP tax rate of 24.4%. Again, please refer to the supplemental information page on the Investor Relations page of our website for a reconciliation of GAAP taxes to non-GAAP taxes. We estimate that our full-year effective tax rate will continue to be in the 24% to 25% range on a non-GAAP basis.","Moving on, net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for Q1 of 2019 was $118.4 million or $0.78 per diluted share, and this compares with prior-year GAAP net income of $111.5 million or $0.72 per share. Our non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2019 was $120.6 million or $0.80 per diluted share, and this compares with non-GAAP net income of $113.6 million or $0.74 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018. This represents growth of 6% and 8.1% respectively. To provide some additional details on the results of our operations, I'll note that amortization from acquired intangible assets was $21.8 million on a pretax basis or $0.11 per diluted share for Q1 2019. And that compares to $18.7 million pre-tax or $0.09 per diluted share for the same period last year. I'll also note that in Q1 of 2019, foreign currency exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS by $1.5 cents for the quarter.","Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales of $1.5 billion decreased 0.1% compared with the prior year, with internal growth in local currencies of 3.2%. North American internal growth in local currencies was 2.7% and included 2.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. And with that, we believe we continue to gain market share in North American dental consumable merchandise market and our dental equipment sales and service revenue increased by 3.3% over the prior year.","Our international dental sales growth in local currencies was 4.0% and included 5.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. We believe our international dental merchandise sales growth benefited from either one or two extra selling days in certain European countries due to the timing of Holy Thursday and Good Friday holidays, which occurred in Q1 last year and are in Q2 this year. We anticipate seeing this benefit reverse next quarter. Our international dental equipment sales and service revenue declined by 1.2% versus the same period last year. As we noted last quarter, the International Dental Show or IDS took place in Cologne, Germany in mid-March. This trade show customarily results in lower international equipment sales in Q1. And they typically accelerate in Q2 and beyond.","Turning to medical; our medical sales $683.7 million in the first quarter, an increase of 6.8% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 5.1%. The 5.1% internal growth in local currencies includes 4.9% growth in North America and 9.9% growth internationally. We were pleased with our overall medical sales results, which were driven primarily by solid organic growth from existing large customers along with strategic acquisitions.","As we noted on last quarter's conference call we expected our medical sales in Q1 to be impacted by the continuation of a below average influenza season, which led to physician office visits and related sales from test kits to be lower than prior years. Our technology and value-added services sales from continuing operations were $115 million in the first quarter, an increase of 35.1% with internally generated sales both in local currencies of 2.1%. In North America, technology and value-added service sales on an internal basis in local currencies was 0.9% compared with the prior year and the international markets, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 7.0%. We continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the first quarter and we bought approximately $2.5 million shares at an average price of $59.45 per share or a total of approximately $150 million. The impact of the repurchase of shares on our first quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. At the close of the first quarter, Henry Schein had approximately $250 million available and authorized for future repurchases of common stock.","Let's take a brief look at some of the highlights of our cash flow. We have very strong operating cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter at $133.3 million and that compared to a negative $64.6 million in the first quarter of last year. We continue to believe we will have a strong operating cash flow for the full year 2019. As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pre-tax charge in Q1 of 2019, a $4.6 million or $0.02 per diluted share. This restructuring charge primarily includes severance pay, facility closing costs, and outside professional consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan. As you know, we have extended our restructuring initiative and expect to continue it through Q2 of this year as we continue to look for more opportunities to save ongoing costs as we mitigate stranded costs over time related to the animal health spin-off and also use some of that savings to advance our technology investments, including reinvesting in our CRM project, our European ERP project, and our web interface developments.","Turning to guidance; we are increasing the top end of our 2019 non-GAAP financial guidance range today. At this time, we are not able to provide estimates for costs associated with restructuring for 2019; therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, 2019 diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $3.38 to $3.50, reflecting growth of 7% to 10% compared with the 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations which was $3.17. Again, this compares to our prior guidance of $3.38 to $3.46 and that was a 7% to 9% growth. So again, we increased the top end of our range by $0.04 per share. The company's Animal Health business was spun off to shareholders as of February 7, 2019 and that business has been classified as a discontinued operation starting in this current quarter and for all prior periods that are presented.","Our guidance for 2019; non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is again for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. Our guidance also assumes that foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels and this guidance also assumes that our end markets remain stable and consistent with the current market conditions. As we noted last quarter, we remain confident in our goals of achieving long-term organic sales growth of one percentage points to two percentage points above the underlying market growth and we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS growth will continue to be in the high-single to low double-digit percentages for Henry Schein, and that includes our stock repurchase activity and contributions from acquisitions.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanely.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you very much, Steven. Let's begin with the review of our business highlights for our first quarter starting with Dental. Our North American Dental consumable merchandise sales grew by 2.5% in local currencies, which is in line with the growth of the preceding quarter as end market growth has been quite stable. We believe that we modestly increased our market share versus the first quarter of last year. North American Dental equipment internal sales growth of 3.3% in local currencies improved from the fourth quarter of 2018, as we saw strength in sales of CAD\/CAM products, which grew by approximately 20%. In particular, digital impression sales increased by nearly 30%; internal sales in local currencies for traditional equipment increased by approximately 2%.","Internationally, dental consumables internal sales in local currencies had robust growth of more than 5% due in part to the timing of the Easter-related holidays as Steven mentioned. This timing variance aside, we believe the end market is generally stable in the International Dental consumable market we serve and that we'd continue to gain market share. Likewise, on the equipment side, we believe the market is stable. In fact, in certain markets, it's growing quite nicely. In March, we participated in the IDS event in Germany which occurs every two years. Our international dental equipment internal sales in local currency declined by approximately 1% during the first quarter due largely to this event as dentists in Germany and the surrounding countries often hold off on equipment purchases until after attending the show. This typically leads to a rebound in sales in the second quarter in an IDS year.","Advancements in CAD\/CAM and digital impression solutions were one of the highlights of the IDS as the technology has become faster and easier to operate, which many believe will lead to broader adoption of these technologies in the years to come. In fact, we believe that most dental practices will have digital impression capabilities as standard of care within five or so years. Today, practices have access to a broad selection of options from basic scanners to full systems to promote fast and accurate scans through these scanners that are far more comfortable for the patients to fully [indiscernible] systems that enable a practice to conduct full procedures including the production of crowns and bridges in one visit. All at a range of price points that enable the practitioners to choose what is right for the customer's specific need.","We are clearly at a very exciting time for the industry given the advancements made in digital dentistry workflow. This excitement extends to all of our digital dentistry solutions, of course, including implants, orthodontics, and even endodontics where we leverage deep relationships with our specialty practices and general practitioner customers as well. In particular, internal sales of global implants and endodontics and orthodontics each grew in the mid-single digits to low-double digits in local currency during the first quarter. We're particularly pleased with the growth in our specialty businesses. At IDS, we were excited to announce a variety of innovations, implant-based tooth replacements offered through our BioHorizons and CAMLOG brands. This included the launch of a new implant system called the PROGRESSIVE-LINE, a few line extensions to BioHorizons Tapered implant system and the introduction of our interest dependent [ph] system that promotes fast patient bone regeneration.","Now let's review the medical business, the influenza season in the first quarter of 2019 was fairly light in terms of office visits [ph]. On the other hand, and of course, these tests and related surgical products are really, really important for our customers, the office-based practitioner and the urgent centers. Yes, we delivered solid medical internal growth in the first quarter of approximately 5% in local currency despite the reduction in office visits relating to the influenza season. We're excited to have recently launched our new point-of-care diagnostics tools for medical customers. This is one of the fastest-growing product areas in healthcare as consumerism is driving preference for on-demand test results.","To address this need and capture growth in this area, our medical team has created a point-of-care diagnostics specialist team. This specialized team will provide expertise in the diagnostic landscape and offer a consultative approach to address practice needs. For example, we have been working diligently to expand our private label portfolio with cost-effective, high-quality solutions for our position offices, clinics and other traditional laboratory customers so they can deliver quick, convenient, and reliable tests at the point of care with laboratory-quality performance.","We recently held in Denver, Colorado our most successful medical national sales meeting bringing together our team from across the US to discuss our strategic priorities and sales initiatives for the year ahead. Just like our Dental team, our Medical team Schein members are highly engaged to provide our customers with the highest level of service support, in effect, helping our practitioners focus on operating in a more efficient practice, so that the practitioners can focus on providing the best in quality of care. As we look to the future of our medical business, we believe we are well-positioned to drive continued market share gains from our partnerships with large group practices plus independent physician offices an alternate site of care.","So let's move on to the technology and value-added services business. For three quarters now, our Henry Schein One team has been hard at work combining a host of unique and powerful dental software tools that help dentists build awareness for their practice and better communicates with existing patients as well as generating new patients. These tools include advanced websites; reputation management tools, very important these days; and improved search engine results and online marketing and automated digital communications, all growth areas where we're doing quite well.","To summarize a few highlights, all major imaging vendors have now signed on with our Dentrix Smart image integration solution. Smart Image provides improved image access across image modalities and integration into the practice management system. Interoperability is alive and well at Dentrix and throughout our practice solutions platform. Most exciting, Dentrix Ascend continues to enhance its focus on practice and patient experience with the addition of multiple new enhancements, including more efficient insurance processing, scheduling, pin board, document management, enhanced electronic dental billing functionality, and additional electronic claim codes to help improve business outcomes. Of course, Dentrix Ascend is our cloud-based dental practice management system and we believe the most progressive in the marketplace.","Before we open the call to questions, I would like to highlight the progress we have made in our ongoing commitment to add high-margin products and solutions to a broad range of customer offerings. This is a key element of our strategic growth plan. Since the time of our last call in mid-February, we closed on the acquisition of North American Rescue, a leading provider of survival and casualty care medical products to the defense and public safety markets. NAR had approximately $184 million in sales for the 12 months prior period ending October 2018. This transaction brings us an expansive line of proprietary product brands with attractive gross margins and these solutions will help expand our medical group presence not only in the United States but also globally.","We also announced the acquisition of Lighthouse 360 from the Web.com and provide us easy-to-use dental practice management and patient communication software with 2018 sales of approximately $50 million. Building upon our high-margin software and service businesses has been the cornerstone of our strategic growth plan and Lighthouse 360 is an excellent example of how we're adding to our technology innovation for the benefit of our customers. This highly automated software platform will expand Henry Schein One practice marketing and client communication solutions, providing tools to better connect us with our dental customers and help dental practitioners better connect with their patients and gain interoperability at work.","Our pipeline for investment opportunity is quite full. We look forward to continuing to add innovative dental, medical, and technology solutions that complement our solid organic growth profile. As mentioned, we have a particular focus on driving attractive growth and operating margin expansion over the long term, in fact, over the medium and long term. We are also focused on growing our private brand and control brand solutions as we diversify the next selection of products we offer with attractive pricing to customers and of course attractive profit margins for Henry Schein. We are doing this while still supporting our branded manufacturers and seeking to expand their market share.","The efforts we have undertaken through organic and acquisition growth will be complemented by our programs to reduce costs as part of our restructuring initiative, positioning us well for long-term operating margin expansion. So, again, lots going on at Henry Schein. We remain quite confident in execution of our strategic plan, believe it's a solid plan.","And with that, operator, we would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of John Kreger, William Blair.","John Kreger","Stan, maybe just sticking with that theme that you were just mentioning, if you think about your interest in adding new owned products, where are you most interested in doing that, private label versus brands, dental versus medical, specialty versus GP, just, if you could give us a sense about what you're most interested in? Thank you.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, John. So our goal is two-fold. One is to advance our portfolio and market share in specialty products, dental, endo, ortho, implants, bone regeneration and products that are supporting those professionals and providing specialty dental care. At the same time we've started advancing our specialty area focused in the medical arena with a line of orthopedics, blades and swords that we're doing quite well. We've and had been focused on that also for a while and we focus on expanding that portfolio. So that's one area which is also supplemented, by the way, with the Henry Schein One offering because you could view it as a private brand or a corporate brand, if you will, because it's our own brand, but that's all services, the practitioner with unique products under the Henry Schein brand. At the same time, we have led for years with the expansion of sales led by an expansion of product offerings of high-quality, price-competitive products that we offer through our private brand and corporate brand. And we will continue to do that. Having said that, Henry Schein is primarily a branded, national brand for valued-add [ph] products. However, where we experience price competition, we lead very often with our corporate brand, our private brand, which is highly competitive and enables us, of course, to compete very nicely.","So it's with branded products, our own branded products that are in the specialty areas and software, and private brand where we are offering competitive pricing, however, fully mindful of the fact that we are a national brand supporter and wish to continue to grow our relationships with those manufacturers of national brand products that see Henry Schein as a great partner.","John Kreger","And my follow-up is within the digital impressioning category, it sounds like that's one of the hotter dental categories at this point. Where do you think we are today in terms of penetration? Just trying to gauge, how much further that category has to run before it matures? Thank you.","Stanley Bergman","John, it is conflicting data out there, but it's our view that less, in the United States for example, less than 20% of practitioners have a digital, some form of digital prosthetic device, be it a scanner or be it a fully integrated scanner machine that also is integrated with bridge and crown milling systems and software. So we think it's still under 20% or so. So there's somewhere around the high 70s of the market that's still available. On the other hand, the imaging systems tends to be more penetrated. Having said that, there is still great opportunity in the imaging side knowing full well that the price of imaging machinery -- digital imaging machinery is coming down somewhat. But in terms of units, there's still market opportunity, quite a nice one, and certainly in terms of units lots and lots of opportunity for Henry Schein. So digital dentistry presents huge opportunity for us, what I was talking about is the US but the same general concept apply in Europe and, of course, certainly elsewhere.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jon Block, Stifel Nicolaus.","Jonathan Block","I'm actually going to start with DI as well. And specific to DI, can you just talk about what the dentist are looking for? You know, DI demand is clearly through the roof, but price points vary wildly maybe from 20,000 to 45,000. Stanley, you're in a good position where you are able to sell a wide portfolio of DI products, so where is the GP's interest when we think about the high-end versus the low-end? And then I've got more of a P&L follow up. Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Good question. I think the market is growing at all levels. First of all, there's the entry level. Those practitioners that are putting their toe in the water; that so, not necessarily going for the high-end. But you know, what's interesting is, they migrate from the lower-end to the high-end as they add a second and third device. So we're doing well and have done well, by the way, for the past seven or eight years introducing new practitioners to DI advisors, we often lead with the lower end, sometimes with the mid-range, and then advance to the higher end. So I think the market is good for all, and I think what will become even more effective is the integration, the inter-operability between these devices whether they're DI devices or digital imaging and our software.","There is solid integration now as we mentioned in the call; the leading manufacturers of these devices have signed up to integrate with Dentrix, a lot of the major one's are already integrated and the others will follow soon. So interoperability will drive this category, both in terms of prosthetics and imaging in a significant way in the years to come, both in this country and abroad.","Jonathan Block","Thanks for that, very helpful. And then Steven, I'll hand it to you for the second one, the margin expansion in 2019, I thought was supposed to be maybe somewhat depressed this year just with some of the transition costs that you had 25 bps of non-GAAP expansion in the first quarter. So maybe your thoughts on being able to get to your 20 bps bogey goal this year in '19 despite the TSA noise? And if so, does that mean next year could look even better? Thanks for time guys.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thanks, John. So, Q1 was a very strong quarter, what we expect operating margins we were able to reduce and really came from operating expense reduction there were changes in gross margin, but some of the operating expense reductions that we were able to achieve in Q1, we don't expect to reoccur so while we were guiding more towards a flat operating margin in 2019 then there might be some upside to it, but right now it's still very early in the year so we are pleased with Q1, but we're not ready to say we'll be at 20 basis points for the full year 2019. There are still very good opportunities that we see, and that's why we expanded the restructuring program, because we still see opportunities to take cost out of the system, so again very good for Q1, but we're not ready yet to say that's a full-year opportunity.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson, Baird.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you, good morning guys. Steve, wondering on the North American consumables market, if you can give us any color on what Specialty Group versus the Standard Consumables and if you're still taking market share in the standard consumables or general consumables side, what do you think the market is doing right now outside of your General Consumables growth ?","Steven Paladino","Sure. So first, excluding specialties, we think we did gain market share hard to tell exactly how much maybe 50 to 100 basis points would be the estimate that I would expect, but we did see stronger sales in Specialty products and those depending on if you're looking at implants ortho for endo all of those grew somewhere between the mid-single digits and the low-double digits implants was the strongest of the level which was at the top end of that at double digits. So we're still continuing to do well on the specialty products, but there's still a lot more opportunity in Specialty as our market share is relatively small in those specialty markets.","Jeffrey Johnson","If you could, just maybe remind us what specialty as a percentage of consumables? But then for my follow-up; I just want to understand that guidance you raise the high end of 1Q, as John said, was supposed to be maybe the tougher quarter with spend FX headwinds, some other things you came through that really well, why does the range of EPS for the year go up if you've retired a quarter of risk and kind of got past what we're supposed to be maybe the toughest quarter of the year?","Steven Paladino","Well, let me answer your first question first so total dental specialty product sales on a full-year basis is about $800 million and again that includes implants orthodontic products, endo products and within implants and bone regeneration products that are kind of complementary products to the implants. You know, I would say for the full-year guidance to be some why we raised the top end is because quite simply, we came in ahead of where we expected to be in Q1, we do not think we will give back that improvement in EPS. So we are effectively raising the guidance for the Q1 that we achieved.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nathan Rich, Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Stan, if you just sitting with the North America Dental consumables I think you mentioned kind of in line with last quarter and that was despite a slightly tougher comparison when you talk to us back in February you said you had seen some softness to start the year, but now it seems like you're characterizing then market is stable. So I was just wondering if you kind of talk to us about what played out over the balance of the first quarter and anything that you had maybe point to that improved relative to the trends that you're seeing earlier in the year ?","Steven Paladino","So it did start off slow Q1 and the beginning part of Q1 but it's finished, very strong and again I always try to alert investors that we need to be careful when looking at a short period of time like a month or so, because we have seen over and over again, you know, a trend where month is exceptionally strong or exceptionally weak, but then that trend reverses in the subsequent months so the good news is Q1 finished very strong in March in particular was very strong for us and consumables, I'll turn it back to Stan.","Stanley Bergman","Yes, I think you're correct in pointing out that one has to be very careful when looking at a 4 to 5-week month Android conclusions even in quarter having said that, and we've said this for many years now last 2 or 3 years. In fact the dental markets are stable and consumable market. I'm the referring to particular and is leaning positively, there are some parts of the world where it's leaning more positively the US is quite stable and there's a slight increase in units, but not much and not a lot of inflation. So the market may be growing 1% one 2% and if it grows. One, the sales and to be on the lower end if it grows to on the higher end, but also I think it is fair to say that Henry Schein has been gaining market share for quite a long time, and we expect to continue to do that for the years to come. Very good programs to encourage customers to aggregated purchases with us of consumables equipment software and particularly.","Now specialty products I think consistent with past the markets are stable leaning.","Nathan Rich","And then just as my follow-up. Steve, on the TSAs can you give us a little bit more detail on the products that you're, it sounds like you're selling to co-ventures that's included in that TSA revenue line and it sounds like those are lower margin sales, so I just wanted to confirm that ?","Steven Paladino","Yes, they are very low margin in sales because the TSA agreement really effectively reimburses Henry Schein for its handling costs and that's why there is a small gross profit, but when you get down to the operating income, it's virtually no profit for us. The products vary it continues to include, for example, Henry Schein private brand sales remember on some of these products it takes time to change the registrations in the packaging and that's why we were allowing for these sales to continue because we wanted to make sure core batches had access to the products as they get the registration is complete so it's going to continue for little while now I think you said mid-2020 it could go a little bit further we're a little bit less than that, because we'll try to accommodate co-batches as they need it, because we're not really buying product just for cult we're buying it for the core Henry Schein business and if they need to tap into that from time to time. We're happy to accommodate them.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Ellich, Craig Hallum.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is actually Ryan Cameron [ph] on for Kevin just touch on FX quick. I know you expected it to be a little higher in the first half, do you still expect that impact to subside a bit exiting Q2 or is this kind of run rate we should be expecting throughout the year. And then I got follow-up.","Stanley Bergman","Sure. Well, again, on an EPS basis, foreign exchange negatively impacted this quarter. Our EPS by $0.015, you can look at the details of the sales that we went through that show the sales impact. I think -- again, I always believe that really difficult if not impossible to predict foreign exchange movements, there is too many things that impacted geopolitical things other things that go on. So for us, we're really assuming that the foreign exchange impact is consistent or foreign exchange rates are consistent with what we've seen in Q1. If there are significant deviations from that, that could impact our guidance, but right now we're not assuming that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, Stan. And I know you touched on it already, but as it relates to the growth strategy, I know it's still early on, but maybe what has worked well so far. And maybe what hasn't worked as well as you'd hoped. Could you give us a little color on that?","Steven Paladino","It's a good question. I'm not sure if anything really work exceptionally well beyond our plans in fact with, we are off on our plans. Yes. Of course, when you make an acquisition, sometimes the first two or three quarters a little bit better and sometimes a little bit worse, but essentially the notion that we want to provide a complete line of products for implant just an oral surgeon and implants bone regeneration generally has worked quite well, advancing sales around the implant has worked well too, in particular advancing sales of equipment and other consumables, I would like to see us finding a way to provide a greater share of the wallet of oral surgeon, love to see us so the complete blind every other surgeon we haven't whether its consumables equipment, pharmaceuticals med-surge and different technology, the same with the Ortho doctors love to see our aligner program grow its early stage right now.","The SLX has gained recognition with KOLs at a very small launch at this stage low launch, we will launch our real product, which is being easier product to use to our GP customers through our U.S. sales force. And our national sales meeting in the few months I'd love to see that grow. But we are a taking that step at a time. And I would say on the endodontic side, quite happy with the level of new product introductions edge-endo [ph] which is the lower-end from the pricing point of view of endodontics is doing quite well. And just to go back on the low-end of the -- low priced and of implant side. Our recently closed acquisition and the dentist seems to be doing well, unlike to see us have a bigger position in the low-end pricing point of implants.","I would say in general, we're quite happy with where we are. We've added tremendous talent in this area over the last five years. Specialists in the implant oral surgery area, we've got great expertise at the pace in bundling generation, we have terrific expertise in the whole orthodontic area and endodontic space. So overall, it's steady growth and we'd like to see more advancements of the specialty products into the Henry Schein customer base, and more of the specialty product customers buying the general products from Henry Schein consumables and equipment. So it's a steady program that we've started advancing maybe a decade ago and accelerated in the last few years, and we are quite interested in adding to that platform from an integrated point of view, and we have the capital to do that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Steven Valiquette, Barclays.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks, good morning guys. A couple of questions here. I guess, first just tying together a couple of earlier questions on the topics of operating margins and FX, I guess, I'm just curious in the first quarter. And with that operating margin expansion, did you calculate how much the FX movement actually skewed the reported operating margins in 1Q? And also just in relation to the restructuring overall, just remind us again -- just categorically how much benefit you get in the COGS line versus the SG&A line; just sort of big picture? I'm not looking for any numbers but just -- it's heavily skewed towards one expense line versus the other? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Sure. Thanks, Steve. On your first question, the impact to our operating margin was very small, related to foreign exchange, because we remember both sales, COGS and operating expenses were all converted at the same rate. So it's really just a mix issue that had some minor impact, but it really was not significant for us. Second question, trying to remember, just give me again the second question, I forgot.","Steven Valiquette","Yeah, just on the restructuring, just categorically whether you get more benefit from COGS versus the SG&A line over time, basically.","Stanley Bergman","Yes, sorry. Yeah, virtually all of the restructuring benefits is on the operating expense line. There's a very little that we are getting on the COGS line. So in fact I'm not sure there's any of this is showing up on the COGS line. So it's really all reducing our selling and general administrative expenses, reducing and we did reduce some headcount and we also eliminated some physical locations. So again, it's all on the op -- virtually, all on the operating expense line.","Steven Valiquette","Got it, okay. Alright Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Michael Cherny Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Cherny","Just to kind of stay on that theme a little bit. Steve, I guess, can you tell us what was specific to 1Q in terms of the outperformance on the operating expense line that won't repeat, at least from a qualitative perspective? ","Steven Paladino","Yes. So we've had some expenses that we were able to reduce, but the expenses again are, we're not expecting the bulk of those expense savings to reoccur. There's a number of different categories here so tough really to isolate on one or two things. We\u2019re going to work hard to see if we can continue some of that expense reductions going forward, but at this point, again, we don't think those expenses and they really relate to some employee-related expenses. So we really think that the likelihood of them reoccurring is probably small at this point. So hopefully that clarifies. ","Michael Cherny ","No, that's helpful. I guess I'll stick with that. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Caliendo, UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. On the TSA's, I just -- I appreciate the color on the $100 million. How should we think about the cadence of that over the course of the year? ","Stanley Bergman","I would think that it would be relative number; Q1 is a short quarter for both sales to [indiscernible] we closed, February 7. I would think that the sales are relatively even throughout the year against say for the short Q1. There are not really any products that have a huge seasonal impact. So it should be pretty even throughout the year and we'll continue to do because while it wasn't that material for us in Q1 as the number gets bigger. We wanted to point that out. So that when you look at our operating margins, which is a key metric we can look at operating margins excluding that [ph]. Effectively that's a transfer of products from us through covetrus [ph] even though GAAP requires it to be shown this to sell, it's a sale, again, with no profitability or very marginable -- marginal profitability at the operating income line.","Kevin Caliendo","And just to follow-up on Michael's question about the specific expenses. I appreciate the detail. But can you talk a little bit about the magnitude, is it $2 million, $5 million for just from -- as we try to understand the cadence for the year and trying to understand -- help us model that?","Steven Paladino","It wasn't all related to that -- I would say that approximately half of that would be we beat by $0.04 maybe half of it was related to this activity of lower expenses that may not reoccur and the balance was a number of other things, but I would say roughly half about beat was related to that.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. That question will come from the line of Sarah James, Piper Jaffray.","Sarah James","Thanks for squeezing me in. you mentioned that following IBS, there's a ramp up in orders and I'm wondering if you can help us pace that out a little bit so how the discussions been going since then, how much of that ramp comes in 2Q versus a little bit further on in the year? If you could give us some color on pacing. That would be helpful.","Stanley Bergman","And so Sarah, traditionally, since IBS is right at the end of the quarter and traditionally IBS involves sale mostly equipment and equipment acquired generally installation is nothing really ship in the first quarter, then you start seeing it in the second quarter and ending in the 3rd quarter. Hard to get the timing between the second and the 3rd, right. But in general, it will be good to take a look at sales for the first, second and third in aggregate I think you'll get a trend for how well the equipment market is doing in general. but I can say from Henry Schein point of view, we had a pretty good IBS, traditional imaging and of course, CAD-CAM the scanning part, the VI part was very, very good and I would expect that we will see good results in the second and third quarter in accordance with what is traditionally unfolded in an IBS year. So I give you more specifics but it\u2019s very hard to\u2026","Steven Paladino","I would add is, it's probably more in Q2 and less than Q3, but again, more than that, it's hard to predict at this time.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you everyone for calling in, your interest let me reiterate how excited we are Henry Schein about our future. We believe that we have an outstanding strategic plan again for the next 3 years, which builds on the success of the last few strategic plans, we are focused on advancing our distribution business from a optimization of expenses and more particularly from advancing our customers with better services, supply chain services, digital ordering platform services product offering capabilities and then second, we are excited about what's unfolding at Henry Schein One, and the other value-added services. And 3rd, we remain committed to advancing our Henry Schein brand strategy focused on the specialty areas. We still have a rather small market share so there's a lot of opportunity for us on the upside in the specialty areas too. So you take the three hybrid we have good plans, we have very good management, well positioned on the best [ph] constantly fine tuning engaged in our business day-to-day and a highly motivated team globally. So I look forward to expanding the business organically and inorganically in the quarters to come. So thank you for your interest.","If you have any further questions please contact Carolynne Borders and Investor Relations at 631-390-8105 and you can call Steven as well at the same number 631-843-5915. We look forward to speaking with you again at one of our upcoming investor conferences, including the Bank of America Conference on May 15, UBS May 20, Stifel on May 29, when we next report earnings in August.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us today to discuss Henry Schein's first quarter results. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company\u2019s business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.","Also, these forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.","The contents of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 7, 2013. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. [Operator Instructions]","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Good morning, and thank you, Carolynne. Before I begin to discuss the quarter, let me note that just this week, Henry Schein placed #296 in the 2013 Fortune 500 ranking of America's Largest Corporations. Achieving a milestone as significant as being ranked 1 of the 300 largest companies in America reflects the successful strides our Team Schein Members have made in growing the company, specifically over the last 17 years since we went public. To climb more than 190 spots on the Fortune 500 list in less than a decade is testament to our success in executing on our strategic plan that focuses on our customers' needs by taking advantage of new technologies and tapping into growing markets.","Now turning to our results for the quarter. We are very pleased to report positive growth in local currencies in each of our 4 business groups during the quarter. The performance was driven by organic growth in North America and, of course, strategic acquisitions worldwide. Sales growth was negatively impacted by a number of factors that Steven will discuss in greater detail shortly, yet overall, our bottom line performance was in line with our internal expectations, and we are pleased to affirm earnings per share guidance for the full year of 2013.","Of course, I'll provide additional commentary after Steven reviews the numbers in greater detail, and then, of course, we'll be open to questions and we'll give appropriate answers. So first, let me ask Steven to give you a review of our quarterly financial results.","Steven Paladino","Okay, thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report overall solid results for the first quarter of 2013.","Before we begin, I'd like to point out that Q1 2013 results include onetime non-cash expenses related to the refinancing of the Butler Schein Animal Health debt. This was previously announced during our last quarterly conference call. I would also note that the first quarter of last year of 2012 results include restructuring costs of $11.8 million on a pretax basis or $0.09 per diluted share. Exhibit B of this morning's earnings news release reconciles these onetime non-GAAP items to GAAP net income and EPS from continuing operations.","So with that, I'd like to begin by discussing the 4 factors that affected our sales results for the quarter.","First, our exceptionally strong performance in last year's Q1 2012 made for a difficult comparison in 2013. Specifically, our Q1 2012 local internal sales growth was exceptional at 7.8% on a worldwide basis, and that translated into EPS growth of 19.5%.","Second, in 2013, both the Easter and Passover holidays occurred in the first quarter, whereas last year in 2012, they both fell in the second quarter. So note that the Easter holiday had a more pronounced effect in certain international markets, resulting in 1 less selling day because Good Friday is a national holiday with businesses generally closed in Canada and many European countries.","Third, our Dental equipment sales growth was negatively impacted in both the U.S. and internationally by 2 separate factors. We experienced an acceleration of U.S. Dental equipment sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 from the first quarter of 2013, due primarily to customers taking advantage of Section 179 tax benefits and the possible increased cost impact related to the medical device excise tax. Internationally, the IDS trade show, which occurred in the late -- in late in first quarter of 2013, resulted in lower European Dental equipment sales in the first quarter as practitioners generally delay purchases in anticipation of the show.","Finally, in 2013, New Year's Day fell on a Tuesday, while in 2012, it was a Sunday, and this basically means that there were more selling days that were impacted in 2013.","So with that as a backdrop, let me now turn to our financial performance. Our net sales for the quarter ended March 30, 2013, were $2.3 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared with the first quarter of 2012. This consisted of 9.2% growth in local currencies, a 0.1% gain related to foreign currency. And in local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 3.3%, with acquisition growth contributing 5.9%. You can see the details of our sales growth that's contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release.","Our operating margin for the quarter -- first quarter of 2013 was 6.7%, and it declined 22 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2012 and that excludes restructuring costs in the prior year. However, if you exclude the current year impact of acquisitions, our Q1 operating margin actually expanded by approximately 10 basis points. That was driven by operating expenses as a percentage of sales, which improved by 66 basis points as we continue to control and leverage our expense structure.","If you look at the operating expense improvement, it was offset by a decline of gross margin of 88 basis points, and that was due primarily to 3 factors. First, we experienced greater internal sales growth in the Animal Health business, which has lower margin. Second, we had 2 Animal Health acquisitions, C&M Vetlink and AUV Veterinary Services, internationally, that also carry lower gross margins, and that accounted for about $77.6 million of sales for the quarter. And third, we had some sales product mix across all of our business groups.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, which is in line with our guidance and down from the 32.3% in the first quarter of 2012. We expect our effective tax rate to remain in the 31% range for the rest of the year.","As we've discussed on last quarter's conference call, we refinanced the debt related to the Butler Animal Health transaction during Q1, and as part of that refinancing, we incurred a onetime non-cash charge related to deferred financing costs of $6.2 million on a pretax basis or $0.03 per diluted share, which is net of the noncontrolling interest of Butler Animal Health.","Net income attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2013 was $91.5 million or $1.03 per diluted share. However, excluding the expenses related to the debt refinancing, our net income attributable to Henry Schein for the quarter was $94.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share, and this represents an increase of 5.7% and 8.2%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2012 excluding restructuring costs.","I'll note that foreign currency exchange did not have any material impact on EPS for the quarter versus last year.","Now I'd like to provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Our Global Dental sales for the first quarter of 2013 increased by 3% to $1.2 billion. It was primarily local currency growth of 2.9% and 0.1% gain related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales declined slightly by 0.3% and acquisition growth contributed 3.2% to our sales growth.","If we look at that 0.3% decline in internal growth in local currencies, it is comprised of 1.1% growth in North America and a decline of 2.4% internationally. I'll discuss some detail behind each of those figures.","The 1.1% growth in North America included 1.3% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 0.2% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. Our North American Dental growth was impacted by the items I said earlier: a tough comparison, timing of certain holidays and strong Dental equipment sales in Q4 of 2012 due to the tax opportunities I also mentioned earlier.","The 2.4% decline in International Dental sales included a 1.7% decline in Dental consumable merchandise and a 4.3% decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. The declines in International Dental, both merchandise and equipment, reflect really a cautious spending environment in much of Europe and Australia and 1 less selling day, which is important to note in many European markets, again due to the Easter holiday. Also, equipment was negatively impacted by the IDS trade show.","If we look at our Global Animal Health sales, they were $639.1 million for the first quarter, which is an increase of 21.6%. This included 21.7% in local currencies and a 0.1% decline related to foreign currency. That internally generated sales growth was 6.8% in local currencies, and acquisition growth was 14.9%.","When we look at the components of the 6.8% internal growth in local currencies, our North American business grew by 14.9%, and we had a small decline of 1.5% internationally. The growth in our North American business was again primarily driven by both market share gains and strong sales in parasiticides. Our International Animal Health growth was impacted again by the timing of certain holidays, including 1 less selling day that I mentioned earlier.","We believe we continue to gain market share in this business unit, and this marks our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in this business.","Our Global Medical sales were $388.9 million for the first quarter, which is an increase of 9.6%. This included 9.5% growth in local currencies and again a 0.1% gain in foreign currency.","In local currencies, our internally generated sales was 8.3% and acquisition growth was 1.2%. The components of that 8.3% internal growth include 9% growth in North America and a decline of 3.3% in international.","We believe we continue to gain market share in the North American segment of this business unit, and again, that accounts for about 90% of our Medical total. And overall, our Medical internal sales growth was the highest that we have experienced in nearly 2 years. So very strong results there.","Global Technology and Value-Added Service sales was $74.7 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 18.7%. This included 18.9% growth in local currencies, a 0.2% decline related to foreign currency. And the internally generated sales growth was 11.7%, with acquisitions contributing an additional 7.2%.","The components of the 11.7% growth in local currencies were 11.4% growth in North America and 14.3% internationally, with particular strength in both technology and financial services recurring revenue, as well as strong overall software sales.","We continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the first quarter. Specifically, we repurchased about 840,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $87.50 per share or approximately $73.5 million of cash. The impact of this buyback on the first quarter was not material.","At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $227 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock for the balance of the year.","If we take a look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $38 million. That compares to negative $48.6 million last year. Typically, our first quarter does represent negative cash flow because of certain timing of payments, but we continue to believe we'll have a strong operating cash flow for the year.","Looking at accounts receivable days sales outstanding, they were 40.7 days for the quarter. That compares to 40.1 last year.","Inventory turns for 2013 first quarter was 5.6 turns, and that compares to 6.2 turns last year. And that's primarily because we continue to work down the inventory forward buying that occurred in Q3 and Q4 of 2012.","Also, a few weeks ago, we announced a new loan agreement of up to $300 million based on the securitization of our accounts receivable. It's important to note that this facility represents the permanent financing that we have now put in place for the previously repaid Butler Schein Animal Health debt.","Let me conclude my remarks by reaffirming our 2013 financial guidance as follows. For 2013, we expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $4.81 to $4.91, and that represents a growth of 8% to 11% compared to 2012 results. The 2013 guidance does exclude the onetime non-cash charge related to the deferred financing cost of Butler Schein of $0.03 per share and, as always, our 2013 guidance is for continuing operations, as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but not any potentially new acquisitions.","So with that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven. So Henry Schein has a robust global footprint that serves the dental, animal health and medical office practitioners. Because of our scale and our reach, as well as our strategic opportunistic acquisitions, we are able to post continued gains as measured by a number of financial metrics.","Strong performance among certain customer types, geographies and new product lines helps to offset challenges in other parts of our company. Our first quarter results serve as a prime example of the value of our diversified business model and related portfolio.","While we have provided detailed insight into sales performance during the first quarter, keep in mind that every quarter has factors that cause growth to fluctuate. Having said that, the first quarter came in where we expected to perform from an earnings per share perspective, and that's from a company-wide overall consolidated perspective.","Let me now provide some specific observations on each of our business units. So on the dental side. Last quarter, there were 2 significant dental trade shows that served to affirm that we have -- what we have been experiencing in terms of dental sentiment and the demand for various product categories in the United States and Canada and European markets. The U.S. dental market has been characterized by consistent patient traffic and fairly stable procedure mix.","Our view of the market was echoed at the Chicago Midwinter Meeting in February, where there was a particular interest in our cloud-based Practice Management system, Dentrix Ascend, which we unveiled. The beta version of this new product was introduced actually at the meeting, and we began taking some orders.","About a month after the Chicago Midwinter Meeting, the biennial IDS meeting took place in Cologne, Germany over a 5-day period of time. IDS is a very large trade show, the largest, actually, dental trade show in the world, with a strong European representation that is well known as a forum for introducing new products. Sales are particularly focused, by the way, on the German dentist, the Austrian dentist and some dentists from, perhaps, the Netherlands and nearby locations, but it's primarily a German marketplace from an order-taking point of view.","At the show, we introduced the new Easy Dental implant by Camlog. The product is now available in Germany. This is the first implant system designed for easy use with CAD\/CAM in that scanned abutments can be packaged with each case, so clinicians have a preplanned digital workflow for developing custom abutments. Of course, there are other systems similar available, but not by one of the larger companies, and in Germany, in particular, Camlog is in a most leading position in the implant environment. And so, I think we yet again, for this market, introduced significant change to the dental community.","Overall, we had a successful IDS and are happy with the results of the show. Yet looking beyond IDS, the European dental market continues to be characterized by stable market conditions in certain countries, specifically Germany, and considerable uncertainty in other countries, with Italy leading the pack.","More on that -- on the dental market in response to Q&A which investors may have.","So now let's turn to the Global Animal Health business, where we are in the process of rebranding Butler Schein Animal Health to become Henry Schein Animal Health. This process will take place throughout 2013 and links the branding of our U.S. operations more closely with our market-leading Animal Health business throughout Europe and Australasia. In fact, we are the only global animal health distribution business in the animal health space.","Also, as Steven mentioned, we refinanced the $220 million in debt we took on at the Butler Animal Health joint venture stage, which was formed back in December of 2009. We've done particularly well in that joint venture. And our Domestic Animal Health business is doing very, very well, as we combined 3 brands to create what is today in our view the most successful animal health distribution company in North America, as evidenced by 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit internal growth specifically related to the companion animal arena and, of course, a continued market share growth as well.","Our International Animal Health business, bolstered by acquisition growth, continued to gain share with growth in local currency of nearly 29%. But internal growth declined slightly, primarily due to macroeconomic factors, as well as 1 less selling day in most of the countries. Also more on that later if people have questions.","So now let me turn to the Global Medical group, where we are pleased that internal growth in North America represented the highest growth rate in nearly 2 years, as we made further gains in domestic market share. We experienced particularly strong sales growth in the IDN world, integrated delivery network world; urgent care settings; and ambulatory surgery centers, as our upmarket strategy, which we began implementing almost a half a dozen years ago, continues to gain traction. And what I'm referring to now is our core business.","Let's take a little bit of a look at the impact of influenza this year. The past influenza season ran long in the U.S. and peaked late. And we sold approximately 311,000 doses of influenza vaccine during the first quarter, representing sales of about $5.3 million. We also improved sales of diagnostic and testing products.","So now let me conclude my overall remarks with a view on our exciting Global Technology and Value-Added Services groups. Sales growth was strong both in North America and internationally, and what is important here is that this group is making very good strides expanding from our strong footprint here in the United States. Of course, particular strength in the recurring revenue streams for technology and financial services based on what was pretty good software unit sales as well. The business is well positioned strategically to service, in particular in the U.S., the entry-level practice, software practice, the mid-range and, of course, the large enterprise systems, including dental schools. And we're experiencing similar growth patterns in the animal health arena here and are very pleased with our progress on the international side with respect to software and also our nascent but growing financial services business abroad.","So before we take questions, I'd like to share 2 recognitions we recently received. First, the leading international think tank Ethisphere Institute named Henry Schein to its 2013 World's Most Ethical Companies ranking for exemplary ethical leadership, worldwide business standards and commitment to corporate social responsibility. We have now been listed on this ranking for the past 2 years running.","In addition, Fortune Magazine included Henry Schein in its 2013 list of the World's Most Admired Companies. We have been on this prestigious list for the 12th consecutive year since we qualified for the Fortune Magazine ranking. This year we earned first place ranking within our industry in 5 categories and took second place in the remaining 4 categories.","So there's a lot that's happening here at Henry Schein. I think we've just covered the surface, and we'd be happy to provide more information in response to questions. So, operator, we're ready to take those questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm just trying to peel back the onion here a little bit in the Dental business. Steve, you called out some of the specifics around the equipment shift, the Easter shift, the 1 less selling day, and I'm just kind of curious if you kind of take out all those individual pieces, could you maybe give us your assessment of kind of where you think the general market is trending, both in terms of volumes, as well as I'm sure there was some price inflation that maybe ultimately aided that group? And Stan, if I heard you correctly, I think you were seemingly suggesting that the dentist office traffic is somewhat stable, so I'm really just trying to get maybe a little bit of a better sense of the organic trends pulling out all the pieces if possible.","Stanley M. Bergman","Okay, Steven will give you -- translate what I'm about to say into math. But generally, we feel that in North America, in the U.S. in particular, visits to dentists are kind of stable. We're talking about shifts of basis points, so we may find 1 month a little bit up, 1 month a little down, but I think we have to be cautious in assessing this year's volume compared to last because the weather last year was exceptionally good, and this year, we had some regional challenges. So if you take that out, you'd have to make a subjective guess. And from where we're sitting, we think that overall, it looks like the market is relatively stable. And now Steven can translate that into math because, of course, we review this quite intensely.","Steven Paladino","So as Stanley said, we did a fair amount of analytics on the impact of those 4 items I discussed at the beginning of the conference call. And so first, let me state, there is a little bit of judgment in determining what the impact is, but we feel very confident that it negatively impacted our sales growth by as much as 2 percentage points on a worldwide basis and slightly more than that on a dental basis because we do believe that some of those items are exclusively dental-related, the strong Q4, 22% sales growth in equipment, things like that. So we do believe that it was approximately 2 percentage points to our internal sales growth, Glen.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe if I can just follow up on one question on the debt business -- the Animal Health business. I think by your own measure, you would suggest that the market is probably growing mid-single digits, somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. But yet, Stan, you guys continue to post results that are more than double that market growth, and I think, Steve, if I sort of heard you correctly, I think you seemed to suggest that it was some market share gains in maybe parasiticides, if I heard you correctly. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit. And I'm kind of curious, were there any sort of mix in the sales going from agency to traditional sales, any sort of onetime things that you think are kind of worth calling out, or is that really, I guess, good organic number for us to be thinking about?","Stanley M. Bergman","First of all, I think we've covered this several times on these calls. One has to be careful. We are -- with the mix between large animal and companion animal. Yes, we a little bit are in the large animal business, but that's an area we don't really focus on. And so when looking at us compared to general data available in the marketplace, please remember we are focused on the companion animal area with some equine in there. And the large animal had some changes in distribution over the past year or so as competitors left the market. And so take that into account when comparing us to others, number one. Number two, there is -- there was a significant switch to -- in the agency billing relationship, where sales moved from GAAP fully booked sales -- moved to fully booked sales from agency sales. So if you take that into account -- and again, it's very hard to get this perfect -- we believe that our growth, our normalized growth, was about 9%, and we believe that the market is growing somewhere around 4% to 5%, and of course, it's very difficult to get this precise, but we think we're growing at about 2x the market growth, and we believe we are really gaining market share very nicely. Now I don't believe we're going to necessarily continue to grow internally at 9%, but we believe that the market is growing 4% to 5%, and we very much believe that we will continue to gain market share. And by the way, I can make that statement on market share growth with respect to all of our businesses, which I think are well positioned to continue to gain market share. So I think you have to be a little cautious here. The data is not very good, but I think that we are growing at about twice the market and feel very comfortable in sustaining well over market share -- growth rates well ahead of the market at least for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to actually dive into the medical business a bit. The growth there was really much better than we would have thought, and I was hoping you could maybe spend some time discussing what's going on in the segment and in particular North America, maybe specifically on the share gains you saw and whether or not that was related to recent consolidation in that space. And then I guess just broadly if you could maybe characterize the utilization that you're seeing at the physician office level that'd be helpful.","Stanley M. Bergman","Sure. So I think you're correctly asking us to focus on the United States because our international medical business is not material relative to the size of Henry Schein at all. So again, this has been covered several times in conference calls, but I'll do it again because I'm sure there are a lot of new shareholders on this call. About half a dozen years ago, we undertook a study to figure out -- to try to figure out internally which way the markets would be heading from a Henry Schein point of view with respect to delivery of health care. We actually -- we undertook 2 studies. One is the methodology for delivery of health care and the second is which areas of the office space practitioner, which specialty areas we should focus in on. And I think the conclusions we reached have paid off very nicely for Henry Schein. We concluded on the delivery side that the concept of multiple locations under common management. The industrialization, if you will, of the office-based practitioner would be something that would be accelerating. It's already started a half dozen years ago, unrelated to the Affordable Act, but related to the way providers were being reimbursed by insurance companies and the like. So economies of scale, economies of competency were important already a half dozen years ago. So we established a group that focused on what we internally call upstream sales. These are these larger enterprises and they're all just a little bit different. Many are outgrowths of IDNs or part of IDNs. Many are large group practices, multi-specialty, single specialty. Many are spread out over large geographies and we have established our health care services group to focus on sales in this area. And we believe that we have very good tools, both systems and computer systems and systems around the computer with the right kind of management and team members to focus on the needs of these newer entities. And we believe that this is growingly being recognized in this marketplace. As it relates to the competition, quite frankly, we are focused on our internal business and we are focused on taking market share and not focused on any one specific distributor. Having said that, I think we are ideally positioned to handle these larger enterprises and one should be careful with where the large volume of business is today, which is primarily the smaller practices and that is migrating to the larger practices. So one has to be careful when assessing who the players are as to determining who is better positioned to go after these larger enterprises. That's number one. And number two is, and we'll go into this in more detail if you want, we are focused on certain specialty areas which we believe we are best suited to service, and these specialty areas have characteristics similar to our dental and Animal Health business.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful, Stanley. Just -- and I guess just on utilization, in medical, was the other piece of the question, how would you characterize overall utilization that you're seeing within the physician?","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, certainly, the first quarter had significant increase in utilization due to the flu and also due to good weather. But quite frankly, yes, utilization is important to us, but what's more important to us is gaining market share in a rapidly changing market, where we believe, really, we have unique supply chain and system capabilities to help these newer entities manage the cost of supplies used by physicians. We're very excited about this business. Of course we're still investing, but the investments we've made over the last half dozen years have paid off very, very handsomely.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then, Steven, if I could sneak one in, just you mentioned the tax rate being higher. Maybe a little bit more specifics on what drove the higher tax rate? And then are we still thinking about 30% to 31% for the full year?","Steven Paladino","Yes, the tax rate was actually lower than last year, and we are thinking that somewhere plus or minus 31% effective tax rate for the balance of the year is in line -- it's down a little bit on a year-over-year basis, but again that's because of certain tax planning initiatives that were put in place. So really not a major change there, but slightly down over the prior year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to talk a little bit about M&A. You had a great contribution this quarter particularly from the deals you've done in the veterinary side. It seems like recently some of the more large deals have skewed in that front. As you think, particularly heading into 2014, I know, Stan, you talked a lot about your growth in specific specialty areas. Is there any thought to augment your M&A strategy based on where you see the market going, particularly related to the U.S.-driven demand and trying to help, I guess, some of your clients as they deal with the new realities of health care reform, both on the dental and medical side?","Stanley M. Bergman","So -- good question. Our pipeline for M&A remains quite full. Of course, I could've made that statement each year over the last 17 years. We focused on a careful balance between internal growth and acquisition growth. Can't tell you if and when any deals will close. But in all 3 of our verticals, we are focused on important strategic acquisitions, not necessarily large in size, some are in size, but most importantly on ways in which we can augment either our geographical presence or our product offering presence. As it relates to the change in delivery of health care, on the dental side, I think we have been very well positioned to service the dental management -- the DMOs, the dental management organizations. For -- I think we started our group in that area 17 years or 18 years ago -- this was before we went public -- and have done very well in servicing these large groups. Now there's always competition, of course, but I think our systems, with huge investment and our know-how in this group is quite extensive so I don't think any acquisition will impact us there. As it relates to the medical world, yes, there are ways in which we can expand our footprint, but the investment that we've made in the systems required by these newer enterprises, investments in terms of software and people is what's going to drive the growth over there. Of course, there's always opportunity over there to add some more tonnage through our structure, and that is -- of course, it pays off in terms of driving more volume through a relatively fixed-cost infrastructure. But I think we're well positioned. We will continue to make additions to expand our geography and product offerings as we did in the diagnostic arena in the last couple of years, but actually, nothing that we need to do to address the needs of the changing delivery network system.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great and then just one question on IDS. So you mentioned the impact it had relating to equipment purchasing in the international market in the quarter. Obviously, a very, very busy show; your booth was packed to the gills. Can you maybe compare the interest that you saw out of IDS and some of your tools from the ones from your partners over there versus previous IDS shows, what that means in terms of how quickly you expect that to convert over to potential orders?","Stanley M. Bergman","I think we can expect very similar patterns to the patterns we expected 2 years ago. Our backlog in Germany is quite reasonable and we expect to execute on that in the third and fourth quarter. As it relates to the competition, gosh, I don't know specifically whether they had good shows or not, but I think we got our fair share of business. I think our philosophy of focusing on high tech both in terms of scanners for the X-ray market and in the CAD\/CAM area, both in the dentist office and in the lab office, is paying off, and I think that IDS helps give us credibility in that area. The whole area of changes in the dynamics in dentistry through digitalization is a very exciting area. I think we advanced nicely at the Chicago Midwinter show and IDS. We expect to gain very nicely in the fall shows in the U.S. So I think that IDS was very helpful to us from a sales point of view and of course, from a branding point of view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On dental, you mentioned you did a lot of careful studying of those various factors that impacted the results. And I don't want to get too granular in all that stuff. And really, I'm just trying to figure out, if you think about those in terms of size and magnitude of the impact, which of the -- I guess, which single factor had the biggest revenue and earnings impact on the overall income statement in the quarter? This is, again, on dental in particular. I mean I'm guessing it was the IDS timing, but if it was one of the other factors like either the pull-forward of sales into the fourth quarter or the timing of the holidays, I'd be curious to hear that, but if there's one that stood out as the biggest impact, I would be curious to kind of hear more about that.","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, you have to break it down into equipment, consumables and geography. And I think you pointed the impacts correctly. If you take equipment in North America, we had a 22% growth, internal growth, in the fourth quarter of last year. We've cautioned everybody on our call, 22% growth in equipment in North America, it's just not sustainable. So it was obvious that we pulled sales from the first quarter, maybe even from the second quarter, into the fourth quarter, primarily related to the 2 tax issues that people thought would change. I will say that low-cost financing -- not that we have anything special, but the interest rates are pretty low right now is good for the equipment environment in general. But I would say that on the -- in the North America side, the equipment change was significant. Also on the consumables side, yes, in North America, the weather was very good and the Easter days, I think, are something that needs to be taken into account and that's important. As it relates to Europe, I would have to say IDS had the biggest impact on German equipment sales, but also, I would have to point out to the fact that the economy in Italy, we pointed this out last call, is deteriorating and we did experience some deterioration in a couple of other markets in Europe, a little bit in Australia. But overall, those are the big trends, I would say.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But it sounds like just given the size of North American Dental versus international, that maybe the -- that pull-forward is maybe one of the bigger, if not the biggest factor on the equipment, it sounds like. So...","Stanley M. Bergman","I would say, yes, it had to -- I mean, I think everyone knows the dental market for equipment in North America is growing somewhere in the single digits, high-single digits, mid-single digits depending on which part of the market you're in. So 22% growth, 3.5x or 3x the market growth is not something sustainable.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And are you going to stick with your policy of not really commenting on the current quarter for any improvement now that we're kind of mid-May?","Stanley M. Bergman","I will leave that up to Steven, who's the best [indiscernible].","Steven Paladino","So I don't want to give specifics. We do have an overall stronger equipment backlog on a worldwide basis, so that really lends itself to the IDS comments, which really is weighted towards international. We do think just on your earlier question, Steve, on the consumables, the biggest factor was the timing of holidays, Easter, Passover, Good Friday. All of those holidays negatively impacted Q1 and for the most part, reversed in Q2. But I just need to point out because if you look at all of our business units, dental, medical and Animal Health, all had slight declines in the international markets. And there are certain macroeconomic factors in Europe that are continuing to have an impact in our markets. We think we're doing better than the market, but it really means -- doing better is down less than what the markets are on an average basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a first one on dental market share. And if I could push you a little bit there, I think you alluded to the -- that you believe you continue to take share here in the U.S. We've done some work which shows that the regionals or locals might be a little bit more sticky in terms of share than they've been in the past. And Stanley, maybe you could talk to how the environment was when you and Patterson were 50% in the market versus 60% or 70% today? And the share that you're taking, is it easier? Is it more difficult? What resides with the local guys, is that more loyal as we're in a price-sensitive environment?","Stanley M. Bergman","I think the local players -- I mean generally, it is 1 or 2 that are particularly strong, but if you x those out, I think they are, in fact, losing market share as a group. And it's very difficult to comment on a specific quarter. I think one should be very careful with that. But overall, the big movements in the markets on the equipment side relate to technology, and I think the smaller companies just don't have the breadth of technological products, whether it's software, whether it's CAD\/CAM, sensors, the 3D opportunities and more importantly, connecting them all together. So I think they have a challenge. I'm not going to say that they cannot service individual products and undercut us on price, but I don't think price has ever been the big issue in the U.S. dental market. We keep a very careful eye on those dentists that view price as important. And periodically, there are items such as gloves -- the glove category is going through some price compression now. But -- and we have promotions in certain markets in the different brands to compete in that area. But I would not say that, that's really the biggest challenge. So I don't think the smaller distributors really have an opportunity to compete effectively in the technological race that is going to become even more important as we move from manual impressions to fully digitalized chairside or laboratory impressions and the whole prosthetics arena tying into implants. I just don't think that, that's going to be where the race is going to be won, and I think that the luster of the smaller distributors as a group has been tarnished over the last decade or so.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Perfect, very helpful. And just a follow-up, if you can just talk to the North American consumable number of, I think, you said, Steve, 1.3% was very similar to the 0.9% in the fourth quarter. I know there's a bunch of moving parts, but didn't you tack on another 1% or 2% on price from the med device tax? So when you talk to a stable environment, is it just you've got to factor that in but then also take out 1 to 2 less selling days? Can you clarify that? And lastly, just on the cash flow, it looks like stock comp came down for the second consecutive quarter. So is that just at a lower run rate when we look forward?","Steven Paladino","Okay. So on your first question, the patient traffic and the comment on stable U.S. dental market is really after you exclude the less selling days and the timing of the holidays because obviously, if you have less selling days that's going to impact. But when you normalize for that, we think the market is stable. And again, if as much as 2 percentage points growth was impacted by these timing differences, it really shows, I think, that those price increases, related to medical device excise tax, are for the most part being passed through by all of the players. With respect to stock comp, stock comp was down a bit the last couple of quarters. There is a little bit of ebbs and flows there because the way our comp program works, it's based on financial results. So if financial results come in higher, the comp goes up a little bit. They come in lower, it goes down a little bit. But I do think it's really going to be at these similar levels going forward, maybe it'll tick up a little bit during the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if I could follow up on your last answer there just on the pricing side. There's been a little confusion out there, I think, over the last few weeks since you guys did some marketing meetings on whether or not price increases being passed through from the manufacturers are sticking. Everything I've heard is that they have been, but I think some investors may have heard that they weren't sticking. Just want to make sure we're on the same page here that for the most part, I think you said, those price increases are sticking or -- and would you quantify them, kind of as you roll everything together, around 100 basis points positive or so or how would you think about that?","Steven Paladino","Well, so, first, let me just provide a little detail because price increases that we get from our suppliers, there is no separate price increase for medical device excise tax. So if a manufacturer increases their prices 3%, you don't know how much of it is normal price increases for raw materials and other reasons or medical device excise tax. But the analysis that we did at the end of the year and beginning of Q1 was that the price increases on average were greater than prior years and were more broad-based. So we saw more suppliers having higher price increases than in prior years. So that's why we believe that for the most part, and it's a generalization, that those price increases have been sticking. From our perspective, while we always discount a certain amount off of our published pricing, really, there was not any major change in our discount level versus our published pricing. So that's what leads us to believe that the pass-through was, generally speaking, continuing on medical device excise tax.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And then, Stanley, I'd love to get your opinion. I know we've discussed this in the past, but you've been selling E4D here for a number of years. You recently added the 3M product and maybe some others down the road on the in-office CAD\/CAM side. Just would be interested to hear again kind of your updated thoughts on where you think that in-office CAD\/CAM market goes over the next year or 2, especially in North America. Do we see price points come down aggressively? Do dentists start looking at the lower-priced systems? Do they stay buying the higher-priced systems? Is there a pause in the market as they evaluate? Just how do you see it playing out?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, Jeff. What I think you can safely bet on is that the market is going to have a lot of players. There are 3 major component parts to CAD\/CAM. One is the scanner, one is the software and the third one is the mill. On the software, one of our people counted about 200 systems at IDS. Obviously, they're not all going to make it, but there's a lot of new systems -- a lot of new scanners that are going to come out and they will be brought to market in different ways. Sold through distribution like us, handed free of charge by laboratories to customers, and included in a full CAD\/CAM system, chairside system that may be sold by 1 or 2 or perhaps now 3 -- or 4, actually, manufacturers. So there's a lot of changes in that side. There will be fewer software companies and lots of milling units that will be available in the marketplace. And how this will all play out we don't know, but what we do know is dentistry is moving rapidly in this direction and there will be greater use of scanned prosthetic capturing devices leading to significant changes in the laboratory environment, where products will be milled digitally rather than only manually. And there will be a lot of activity going on in the office as well. At Henry Schein, we are committed to what we call an open architecture. So we are committed to working with best-in-practice and software and hardware, and our goal is to come up with the best solution, integrated solution, for the scanner, the software and the mill, all tying out to an open architecture with materials and, of course, implants and related activities that are revolving around the implant from a prosthetic point of view. Very exciting. We have many, many definite initiatives going on at Henry Schein, all related to our global prosthetics initiative, and we believe we will continue to grow our business in this area, and a greater amount of our sales will be related to this newer technology on the dental side and in the dental lab arena.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Stan, are you by chance seeing any signs of increased seasonality of demand in the U.S. dental market? We're certainly seeing that in broader health care. Curious if you're seeing any of that spill into dental.","Stanley M. Bergman","When you say seasonal, you mean related to the...","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The resetting of health insurance deductibles. So people tend to go to their providers in the fourth quarter and then not so much in the first quarter.","Stanley M. Bergman","It's possible that there is some of that. I've heard a little bit about that from some of the people in organized dentistry. But I don't believe there's any formal data available. I do believe that some larger companies and maybe midsized companies, change their whole medical insurance programs to limit any exposure that might kick in, in 2014 or allow for greater flexibility and therefore, in that context, may have changed elements of dental. So that may have had some impact on visits to dentists in the fourth quarter versus the first, but there's no hard data that I've seen.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then just one last one, can you give us an update on how your various specialty businesses are doing in dental compared to the general restorative lines?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. Of course, the biggest part of our business is in the implant arena, and the biggest part of our implant business is the Camlog business in Germany, which did quite well, actually, in the first quarter. We took market share, and we actually grew quite nicely in that marketplace. And so I would say on the implant side, a big part of our business, at least from a sales point of view is in Europe and Germany, and we did quite well. I think on the endodontic side, we also are stable to growing depending on which market, and on the orthodontic side, it's not material to Henry Schein at all.","Okay. I think we're being told by Carolynne that we should end our call. Thank you for your interest. Again, I think you can tell by the tone from Steven and myself that we are quite optimistic about our strategies and the state of the business. I think we'll continue to make progress in each of our 3 verticals: dental, medical, Animal Health, as well as in our Practice Solutions, Value-Added Services and financial services group. So I think the strategies are there and we're making good progress. I think we have invested very nicely in those businesses and particularly in management and in the team, and the morale in the company is very high. And I think overall, that's reflective in the good performance. Steven reiterated and so did I guidance for the full year, so at this point in time, we still remain quite confident that we will deliver on the guidance range. The markets are solid with some challenges in the international arena, but I think we will continue to grow market share even in those markets. So thank you very much for your interest today. If you have any further questions, please contact Steven or Carolynne at (631) 843-5500, Carolynne Borders or Steve Paladino, and they can put you through to either one of them. So thank you very much, and look forward to speaking with you in 90 days.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"10845":["Henry Schein, Inc.

Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.","I ask that during the Q&A portion of today's call, you limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up before returning to the queue. This will provide the opportunity for as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour we have allotted for the call.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stan Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are so pleased with our first quarter financial results. And we believe we have gained market share in each of our business groups. The global markets we serve remained generally healthy during the quarter. And although we faced continued headwinds from currency exchange in our International business, the impact was far less than in 2015.","Looking at the bottom line, double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS represents a solid start to the year. We also are pleased to affirm guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share, which represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to the adjusted 2015 results. We have made good progress across the board in all of our businesses in advancing our strategic plan.","The morale in the company is great. The management team, I think, is well-positioned and focused. And with our change that we announced at the senior level, we think we are even better prepared to implement our strategic vision and are very, very excited about the future of the company.","In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent performance and business accomplishments and, for the moment, I ask Steve to review our financial results. And I'll be back in a few minutes. Thanks. Steven?","Steven Paladino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning. I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2016. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $4.1 million pre-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share. Also, our Q1 2015 results include restructuring costs of $6.9 million pre-tax or $0.06 per diluted share. We expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the second quarter of 2016.","I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which is excluding those restructuring costs in both periods, as we believe the latter is useful for comparative purposes. Exhibit B to this morning's news release reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations.","Turning to our results, net sales for the quarter ended March 26, 2016, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 10.1% increase compared with the first quarter of 2015. This consisted about 12.0% growth in local currencies and a 1.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 9.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.7%.","I think it's important to note that when you normalize our sales for switches between agency sales and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for Q1 were 6.1%. Again, you can note the details of sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued this morning.","Operating margin as reported for the first quarter of 2016 was 6.5% and contracted by six basis points compared with the first quarter of 2015. However, when excluding restructuring costs, acquisitions completed during the past 12 months, and also excluding the impact of switching between agency and direct sales, our adjusted operating margin expanded by 23 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2015.","Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%. And on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the structuring costs, it was slightly less at 30.4%. This compares with 30.8% in the first quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs. We expect our effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the 30% range for the remainder of the year.","On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $116.8 million, or $1.41 per diluted share. That represents increases of 7.7% and 10.2%, respectively, compared with the first quarter [of 2015].","As a reminder, about 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we do not hedge against that translation exposure. And although foreign exchange impact was less than the prior year, it was still approximately $0.02 dilutive to our EPS in the current quarter.","I'll now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the first quarter of 2016 increased 4.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 6.1% growth in local currencies and a 2.0% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.9% and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.2%.","The North American internal growth in local currencies was 6.4% and included 4.6% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 13.5% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our consumable merchandise sales growth was highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to large group practices, dental service organizations, and community health centers. Our growth in equipment sales and service revenue reflected particular strength in high-tech equipment.","The international internal growth in local currencies was 2.3%. That included 1.6% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and a 4.3% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our consumable merchandise sales internationally was led by France, Australia, and Spain. And growth in equipment sales and service revenue was led by Germany, France and Australia.","Our Animal Health sales were $771.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 12.7%. This included growth of 15.6% in local currencies and a 2.9% decline related to foreign currencies.","Internal sales in local currencies grew by 9.8%, while acquisitions contributed 5.8% to growth. The North American growth in internal sales in local currencies was 16.7%. However, it's important to note that that reflects a 7.4% growth when we normalize results to again account for the impact of certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales.","We believe this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Health business and also reflects the strength of the broader Animal Health market. Our international Animal Health internal growth in local currencies was 3.1%.","Turning to Medical, our Medical sales were $538.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of 21.3%. This consisted of 21.5% growth in local currencies and a small 0.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange. The 21.5% growth in local currencies breaks out between 22.3% growth in North America and 2% growth internationally. Both of those numbers are internally generated.","When normalizing for the impact of agency sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, the North American Medical internal sales growth was 11.2%, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains. We believe we have been outperforming the medical market by a significant margin for the past five quarters, as we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards large group practices.","Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $101.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 18.6%. This included 19.9% growth in local currencies and a 1.3% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 7.5% and acquisition growth was 12.4%. The 7.5% internal growth in local currencies consisted of 8.0% growth in North America and 5.1% growth internationally.","I think it's important to also note that through product upgrades, enhancements and strategic acquisitions, the advanced technology products and services we offer provide a platform for real improvement and efficiency in delivering of healthcare services. There are also new sales opportunities and practice success across all of our business groups.","I'll talk about stock repurchase. During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 664,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $150.51 per share. And that's approximately $100 million of cash flow. The impact on this repurchase in the first quarter to our EPS was less than $0.01 of accretion.","At the close of the quarter, we still had approximately $300 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. And we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value.","I'll take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $101.5 million. That compares to negative $26.7 million in Q1 last year, but I think most people realize that first quarter cash flow for us is typically negative due to seasonality in working capital during the quarter. We continue to believe that on a full-year basis, we will have strong operating cash flow for the year.","Our accounts receivable days outstanding was 42.1 days, which compares to 41.2 days last year. Inventory turns was 5.1 turns this quarter and compares to 5.3 turns last year.","I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2016 financial guidance as follows. For 2016, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65. And that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared with the 2015 adjusted diluted EPS last year of $5.96.","Our guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS is for current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously-announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact for potential future acquisitions. It also does not include the impact of restructuring costs, which are expected to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.13 per diluted share. Also, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates will continue to be generally consistent with current levels.","Last, I'd like to remind you that we report our results on a 52-53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December. So for fiscal 2006 (sic) [2016] (14:45), we will have 53 weeks. The extra week for us is in Q4 2016, but since that 53rd week is a holiday week at the end of the year and sales are usually lower than a typical week, the extra week does not materially add to our earnings, since fixed expenses remain relatively constant with that slow sales week.","So with that financial review, I'll turn it back to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our first business groups with Dental. We are quite pleased to report global Dental internal sales growth in local currency of nearly 5%, with particular strength in equipment, which speaks to the overall health of the broader dental market. From a strategic perspective, establishing Henry Schein in Japan has been a long-standing corporate goal. Japan, after all, is the world's second largest dental market. And through two important investment positions, we are now well on our way in that important market.","You may, of course, recall that we established a presence in Japan in October 2014, with an investment at Iwase Dental Supply. Late in the first quarter, we expanded our Japanese presence by partnering with J. Morita. We have known J. Morita for many years. They are one of the world's largest manufacturers and distributors of dental equipment and supplies, and we hold the company in high regard.","More specifically, we acquired a 50% interest in their One Piece subsidiary. One Piece is composed of eight dental dealers located across Japan. They serve approximately 6,000 dental clinics, and they had sales in fiscal 2015 of approximately $125 million. We look forward to other Japanese dealers joining our partnership in the near future. Japan has about 90,000 dentists and about 64,000 dental clinics. And with the addition of One Piece, we now serve approximately 20% of the market.","Also during the quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, a Brazilian distributor of dental supplies and equipment. Brazil holds good potential for our dental group as well, and this investment builds upon our existing business there, which we established in 2014, as well. I discussed Dental Cremer during our last quarter call, and we look forward to closing this transaction later this year.","Regarding our digital dentistry efforts, we are seeing strong growth in sales of our Digital Impression Solutions with our 3M, 3Shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. Henry Schein offers multiple brands of digital impression scanning solutions here in North America and, given our desire to promote an open architecture and provide dentists with innovative, robust and efficient choices for restorative dentistry, believe we have an excellent offering.","Of course in Europe, we do sell and we believe are the most significant distributor of the CEREC Sirona solution for CAD\/CAM. In addition, we continue to be well-positioned in the lab market on a global basis, providing solutions for digital restorations that are outsourced for the lab facilities.","Last week, Align Technology and 3Shape announced that several of 3Shape's digital scanners will be compatible for use with Invisalign case submissions later this year. The two companies also announced an agreement to enhance digital workflow between iTero scanners and laboratory partners using 3Shape dental software. Like Henry Schein, this announcement makes clear that Align supports an open systems approach to digital impressions. And we are pleased to be advancing along the same lines.","Several months ago, we attended the Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting which is an important trade show for our company. Among our many activities at this year's event, we introduced BruxZir NOW milling block system. This system is compatible with the Glidewell TS150 mill, which will now enable practitioners to offer patients' high-strength, authentic Zirconia restorations in one visit. This system furthers our commitment to our expanding CAD\/CAM product category here in North America and, of course, throughout the world, and to the future of digital dentistry on a global basis.","We're very excited with the progress we are making on all fronts in our dental business, in the core consumable business, the equipment business, the implant business, the other specialty areas and, of course, in our CAD\/CAM solutions in the dental office chairside and, of course, through our digital highway into the lab and our presence within the laboratory space, both in North America and abroad, in Australia or New Zealand, Europe, et cetera, and I might add even now in Asia.","Let me now touch briefly on our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results, our internal sales growth in local currency here in North America was 7.4%. We are making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio. These products are typically sold under multi-year lease. And as those agreements come to an end, we're looking forward to adding even more diagnostic customers to our base. Many of our customers have multi-year agreements in place. And our team is very confident that our offering will be appropriate for the animal health marketplace here in North America and in Europe and Australia, New Zealand.","The diagnostic offering we have will be well-positioned to assume many of those leases as they mature. We are also targeting large practices that may be seeking to purchase additional diagnostic instruments to handle their higher volume patient testing needs, whether it is machinery or the quick test disposable.","Earlier in the quarter, at the North American Veterinary Conference in Orlando, we announced that Axis-Q command center software was available in the U.S. for Abaxis and Heska systems. This software links our practice management software with diagnostic instruments. We have received quite a positive response, excellent feedback from veterinarians who value the efficient and integrated workflow and revenue-capture features offered by Axis-Q.","Our international Animal Health growth in local currencies during the first quarter was more than 13%, which reflects the positive contribution of a number of strategic acquisitions we have completed last year, many in Europe. Again, we are very, very pleased with the progress we're making across the board, across the globe with our Animal Health team.","Also, just like our Dental team, great leadership focused on executing our strategic plan and doing a great job on the ground in each of the countries we're in, but also advancing our strategic product offering that we are driving through our local distribution entities throughout the world. Very, very pleased with the management and the progress that our Animal Health team are executing on.","Now, on the Medical side, the reported growth in our Medical group is impacted by agency sales in the prior year under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, yet when normalizing for this, the core internal growth for the North American Medical business was a robust 11.2%, as, of course, Steven mentioned earlier on.","We remain highly optimistic about our ability to win new customers in the medical space. We have completed the material components of the Cardinal integration. And have experienced positive feedback from the customers that came along with this merger of the two physician businesses and the ASC businesses.","We continue to partner with Cardinal on combined proposals to large IDNs and have had a number of wins. Finally, the Cardinal sales organization that came along with this merger on the physician side has been fully integrated, and we continue to see expansion in our market share within the non-acute space.","Let me conclude a review of our businesses with an overview of the Technology and Value-Added Services part of the business. We are generally pleased with the first quarter performance of this business group, which includes the highest quarterly growth rate in North America in nearly two years, with particular strength in software and financial services.","Early in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Vetstreet. And a month later, we acquired RxWorks. Both transactions strengthen our position of leadership and add value to our customer base worldwide.","This is not just a U.S. strategy on the animal health side, but a global strategy. And we believe we have, by far, the largest install base of animal health practice management systems, both in this country and on a global basis, being in a position to provide huge support to our customer base and also our manufacturing partners, who are seeking the information that we can provide as a result of this install base, in other words, the data and the alignment with our sales organizations as we execute on aligned interests with our manufacturing partners.","As I discussed during the last quarter, Vetstreet is a leading domestic provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics. We are particularly excited about the potential to pair our practice management software solutions with the Vetstreet data analytics capability really, really exciting. There's no one else in our industry, we believe, that has this capability to support not only information that will help the practitioners improve the operations and profitability and care they provide in their practices, as well as support the needs of our manufacturers, specifically on the pharmaceutical side, who are seeking to get their products to market.","RxWorks is a practice management software company serving veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and the Netherlands. RxWorks brings an installed base of more than 1,500 clinics, strengthens our growing practice management software business and complements our expanding animal health technology platform.","A moment ago, I mentioned the Chicago Midwinter Conference. And another one of our launches there was DEXIS for Dentrix Ascend. This cloud-based imaging solution was built exclusively for Dentrix Ascend and helps to quickly capture and store images. Doing so eliminates the need for additional digital imaging software and automates daily procedures, such as insurance billing. This software is initially available to users in North America and exemplifies our commitment to provide digital solutions that improve workflow and allow for better clinical care.","So much of the Henry Schein's future is directly tied to our digital solutions. That'll help, of course, not only in the dental space, where we have imaging and prosthetic solutions that we are offering, and we'll expand that offering in the near future and over the years to come in an exciting way. But the same kind of dynamics, intraoperability, exists as a huge opportunity in our animal health space and in our medical space.","So let me comment on some recent announcements of two new corporate positions that we have established at Henry Schein, aimed at advancing our commercial capabilities and, of course, driving growth opportunities.","Dave McKinley, the President of our Henry Schein Medical Group, has been promoted to the newly-created position of Chief Commercial Officer for Henry Schein corporate. Specifically, Dave will be responsible for the following four areas, global corporate marketing, working across the business to leverage Henry Schein's brand. We have a great brand in four of our different business areas. And we'd like to capitalize on that to advance the overall brand of Henry Schein as a company focused on solutions to the office space practitioner in the dental, medical and animal health space.","There are huge opportunities, we believe, to advance global product category management for the company as a whole across the platform. And then, there are the technology initiatives, including customer solutions, e-commerce and business intelligence, that we have in many, many parts of our business that we feel we can optimize and drive these technologies on a common platform throughout the Henry Schein organization. And then Dave will take responsibility for certain specialty businesses.","Over the last decade-plus Dave has been with Henry Schein, he has made a significant contribution to the company's success, starting with his initial responsibilities for leading our prosthetic business over a decade ago, including developing the initial business plan for E4D CAD\/CAM products and CAMLOG. Both of these products in the end, or actually today, are doing quite well for Henry Schein, and Dave led the initial development of the business plan and the early execution of those business plans.","He also laid the foundation for what is currently our highly-effective Dental Practice Solutions management team on the dental side in Utah. So Dave has been at the forefront of driving change, effective change, at Henry Schein and making a real difference in our strategic platform.","So, we thank Dave for the terrific work he's done to-date in the prosthetics field, in the practice solutions field and, of course, most recently, in the last seven years or so, in developing initially with Mike Racioppi, and then with the rest of the senior management team, our medical strategies, in particular, our Healthcare Services Group, which is the group that services the large practices and then effectively executing on those plans, showing the tremendous results that we've experienced in the medical group over the last years.","Karen Prange, Senior Vice President at Boston Scientific Corporation, will join Henry Schein as the Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of our Global Animal Health, Medical and Dental Surgical Group. This is a new group we've established within Henry Schein. Karen will also be a member of our executive management team, by the way, as Dave will continue. The senior management team who will support Karen's group are, in the animal health area, Peter McCarthy, who will continue to serve as the President of our Global Animal Health Group.","Peter, who joined Henry Schein about six years ago from a large pharma company, really created what is today a very, very successful international business for Henry Schein in Europe and Australia, New Zealand, and then assumed the overall leadership of our Animal Health Group in the middle of 2015, has been a really major contributor to advancing our global animal health platform, results, strategy to develop those results that resulted in these terrific results.","Peter and his team are doing excellent work in our growing Animal Health business, which is showing, of course, excellent results. And Peter and the team are pursuing many of the new and exciting opportunities both to expand our global presence and our unique product offering in the animal health space.","Brad Connett, also a Henry Schein veteran, 20-plus years, has been promoted to President of the Commercial Group in the United States Medical business. And Jeff Waldman, Chief Administrative and Operations Officer for our U.S. Medical Group, will take an additional functional responsibility for sales, operations, and finance.","Brad has done a remarkable job in leading our sales and positioning in the medical markets, a highly regarded executive in the medical space. And Jeff, also an executive over a decade, has contributed a very, very nice way in many parts of Henry Schein on the financial and the operational side. Both these promotions are reflective of Brad and Jeff's success in helping to drive growth in the Henry Schein Medical business.","Ren\u00e9 Willi will continue to serve as President of our rapidly-growing Global Dental Surgical Group. Ren\u00e9, also a seasoned implant oral surgery executive, along with Steve Boggan, President and CEO of the highly-successful BioHorizons implant business, one of the fastest-growing implant businesses in the world, and Michael Ludwig, General Manager of our CAMLOG German business. And Michael has done a remarkable job in establishing the very important position of CAMLOG in Germany. And their teams have done yeoman's work in leading our implant business and positioning us, as Henry Schein, as one of the world's leading implant companies.","So, Karen has deep background in healthcare, extensive experience in managing large matrixed organizations, will be joining us in the middle of May. Throughout Karen's career, she has demonstrated an ability to bring people together, manage change and grow businesses; a 17-year veteran of J&J and, most recently, for the last four years or so, at Boston Scientific.","So, we have created these new positions at a time when market, technology, and demographic forces are converging in one of the most unique ways, at least in my 35-plus years with Henry Schein, to create unique business opportunities for the company. We believe Dave and Karen's leadership will help us to capitalize on the significant opportunities before us.","We're particularly pleased with the deep bench of management we have in each of the three business units that we just discussed: the animal health area; the medical area; and, of course, the oral surgery area, implant area and related products.","I would also like to comment on some upcoming changes that we anticipate with respect to Henry Schein's Board of Directors, that are noted in our current Proxy Statement, and we voted on at our May 31 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We have proposed the addition of two new directors to take the seats of two long-serving directors who will be retiring from our board. The retiring directors, Norman Matthews and Dr. Louis Sullivan, both have helped guide Henry Schein through a period of unprecedented growth and change.","Norman has been a director since 2002, an experienced professional director who has enormous credibility in the marketplace and contributed in a significant way to Henry Schein's growth for almost 14 years. Dr. Sullivan, the former Secretary of Health, similar track record; Dr. Sullivan joined our board in 2003. Both Norman and Dr. Sullivan have been a part of Henry Schein's successful journey over the past decade from a time when the company served only dental and medical customers. I think our sales in the 2002, 2003 timeframe were something like $2.8 billion. At the close of 2015, our net sales were up nearly four-fold to the $10.6 billion. And, of course, we now serve animal health practitioners on a worldwide basis. In fact, Animal Health sales in 2015 were more than our company's entire sales at the time Norman Matthews joined our board.","I could go on at length about the contributions and character of both Norman Matthews and Dr. Sullivan. But instead, on behalf of my colleagues at Henry Schein, my fellow directors and, of course, our shareholders, we simply say thank you for your contribution. You have both contributed in a significant way to creating significant shareholder value for the Henry Schein shareholders.","We are fortunate to have two new director nominees on the proxy who will bring excellent and complete complementary skills to our board. The first is Joseph Herring. His career in healthcare spans more than 35 years. He served as CEO of Covance for more than a decade, up through the acquisition by LabCorp about a year ago. Earlier in his career, Joseph held various senior leadership positions with Caremark International and American Hospital Supply. Upon his election to the Henry Schein board, Joe will bring to Henry Schein comprehensive knowledge on pharmaceutical, management, sales and, of course, experience in growing fast growth companies.","Kurt Kuehn is our second board nominee. Kurt spent his entire career at United Parcel Service and served as the UPS CFO for eight years through his retirement last year.","At UPS, Kurt also had leadership roles in sales and marketing, engineering, operations, and strategic cost planning. Clearly, Kurt is an expert in distribution logistics, as well as corporate finance and accounting, and was part of the UPS successful transition from a pure transportation company to a logistics company that has enormous array of value-added services. We look forward to the many talents he will bring to Henry Schein. And so welcome, Joe and Kurt, to the proxy and trust they will be elected overwhelmingly in May.","So, with that commentary and an overview of the quarterly financial operating performance, there just isn't the time today to go through all the exciting items that are being dealt with at Henry Schein across the board. The company is making advances on so many fronts, in so many exciting ways.","So now, operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Carolynne Borders - Vice President-Investor Relations","Diana?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Dave Francis, RBC Capital Markets.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, Stanley and Steve. Thanks for all of the commentary. Two quick questions, first, on the dental side, Stanley, can you comment on the strength of the equipment sales that you guys have been experiencing? Is there something going on in the market beyond just general strength and confidence of your practitioners in terms of driving the high-tech and other equipment sales, or is there something structurally from a tax or other perspective, that's impacting the demand side of the market there?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Dave. Good question. Generally, I think dentists are feeling good about their practices. I think there is stability in patient visits. And I think dentists are understanding that investing in newer technology provides for better quality dental care, a better experience for the customer, and actually results in a more profitable practice, of course, combined with quality of care.","So I would say it's driven, to a large extent, by some of the newer technologies in the imaging side, on the prosthetics side, and we have a very good offering today of products that match the needs of the marketplace. We did add the A-dec line in North America, which is contributing. Having said that, I think our sales, across the board, even with the existing portfolio of traditional equipment, has been good.","So, overall, it's good dynamics in the marketplace in terms of the dentists feeling good, the newer technology available, and a little bit the result of us expanding our offering with the A-dec product line, but I wouldn't put that much emphasis on that, that is, A-dec is doing well with us, but it's also a relatively small part of the entire equipment portfolio, but it is doing well.","Steven Paladino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director","I would just add one other thing, Dave. Specifically, the CAD\/CAM category was very strong for us in North America. And, as we mentioned on the last call or two, for us, CAD\/CAM is not just selling complete end-to-end units. We also sell a number of scan-onlys and we're seeing strong growth in the scan-onlys, which, for us, we think is very positive in the initial sale, but also positions the customer to come back to us in the future when they're looking to do chairside milling, and they can then buy the additional components from us at a later date. So, CAD\/CAM, the total category of complete systems and scan-onlys, was very strong for us. But it truly was across the board, because traditional equipment as well as high-tech, was both strong.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. That's helpful commentary. And as a quick follow-up on the medical side of the business, obviously strength there, but wanted to follow up relative to your relationship with Cardinal Health. Cardinal just signed a large relationship with Kaiser Permanente and was wondering if you guys participated with them on the outpatient side and if you could give some other, more tangible, examples of where you guys are participating on a joint bid basis? Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On Cardinal in general, our relationship is advancing. As we mentioned, the physician business is integrated, working well and we also have assumed the business in a number of ASCs the Cardinal physician sales force was servicing. So the majority of Cardinal's physician-related alternate care customers have transitioned to our platform. And we are working together on a number of IDN sales opportunities. We've actually generated some very nice sales together.","The particular situation or the particular opportunity with Kaiser that Cardinal, the business they have won, is less in our wheelhouse than the business we undertake day-to-day. I believe that is more of a bulk distribution arrangement. And Cardinal is handling that from their distribution system. So, that is not exactly the kind of business we anticipated working on together. But there are many, many IDNs that we are working on together and actually have landed quite a bit of business in that regard.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard at Jefferies.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Good morning. This is Sachin (46:20) for Brandon. Just a question on cash flow, given the 1Q dynamic, will you provide us with an update on your free cash flow expectations for 2016? And what sort of conversion are you factoring into your projections?","Steven Paladino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director","Sure. Again, although it was negative cash flow for us for the quarter, if you look at the components, it was really driven by working capital, which is typical for us in that typically, inventory purchases in Q4 are higher for a number of reasons and the payments for those inventory purchases occur in Q1. So, that's what drives it. But on a full-year basis, we're still looking at growing our operating cash flow probably consistent with our bottom-line growth rate, our net income growth year-over-year. So, we still believe we can generate strong cash flow on a full-year basis, with some growth similar to our bottom-line growth.","We did also have during the quarter a little bit of duplicative inventory in consolidating some warehouses in Europe, specifically Germany. Over the balance of the year, that inventory level will come down. We did that as a precautionary measure as we're moving and consolidating distribution centers in Germany. We typically have inventory, excess inventory, that we manage through over the next few months. So, again, we still feel that operating cash flow will continue to be strong and grow over the prior year.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. So, it seems like based on obviously the growth rates in your commentary, share is moving still positively in your direction. I mean, I guess, on a sequential basis or on a trending basis, is there any of the business segments where you're seeing a materially more positive shift than others? And if so, I guess, what is the key driver of that?","Steven Paladino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director","Well, I'm not sure that we can say that there are material improvements over the last quarter or two. It's really more gradual improvements. You can see, again, that the U.S. Medical business was our strongest grower. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. That's a strong number. We would like just for that to continue. I don't think acceleration there is something that we can expect. But we do expect that for the foreseeable future that it can continue to put up high single to low double-digit sales growth.","I think we're pleased that across all of our businesses and all of our markets, we think patient traffic has been healthy. U.S. dental patient traffic has been healthy, as well as even in the European markets, although not in every market.","But as we said in the prepared comments, even markets like Spain, that over the last year or two had some challenges in market growth, was a strong grower for us. So I think we feel like the overall markets are continuing to cooperate. We do believe that there's the potential for some very modest continued gradual improvement in underlying market conditions, but we're happy with the overall 6%-plus constant currency growth that we achieved as a company.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, and maybe just on M&A pipeline, I mean, obviously, you guys are regular buyers of tuck-ins. But I guess a lot of volatility in public markets. You typically trade in the private market. Any change in willingness of sort of smaller private owners? Are you seeing more assets come to market in any one segment versus another, or is the funnel pretty consistent?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Ross, the deals we do and have actually done past 20 years and even before we went public are really not so much dependent nor actually related to specific financial market conditions. What drives our deals is generally the synergies that and the interest of potential sellers and potential partners to work with Henry Schein to advance their business for particular family reasons, management reasons, shareholder reasons, et cetera.","And so the pipeline is as full as ever. Of course, there's no guarantee as to when we can close a deal. Deals with us often take many years from the time we start talking to people to the time we close. And there's not much that's related to the financial markets, per se. So we remain quite optimistic that we'll continue with our internal growth and supplement the growth with acquisitions.","We have committed that we will use our cash flow in three ways. One is to buy shares. One is to invest in the business, although investing in the business sometimes is not as important from a cash flow point of view because we're a net generator of cash, but we nevertheless do invest in the business some of the cash flow, but it's essentially from the buying of stock and the investment in acquisitions. And we continue to expect that trend to continue, as it has for years now.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and good morning. Hopefully, I can slip in two questions. So the first one is just, Stanley, over the past year and change, you've made some really interesting acquisitions in vet skill, Vetstreet, et cetera. Can you just talk to the positioning of the North American Animal Health business sort of 18 months after IDEXX going direct? In other words, can diagnostics still sort of be accretive to your overall North American vet growth rate with sort of the products and positioning that you currently have on hand? And then, I got a follow-up. Thanks, guys.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So let me start a little broader and then get specific. Our Animal Health strategy encompasses two major focus. One is to advance geographic presence throughout the world; wherever there's a middle class that is interested in pets, we like to be there and selectively in the production side but very, very selectively. And it's not necessarily where the largest markets are, but there are opportunities. So, for example, we do a good job in dairy in Ireland and New Zealand. And then those kinds of opportunities, plus some opportunities in equine. So, we want to get a large geographic footprint.","And then we want to focus on a couple of things. First is pharma market share around the world and in that connection, we work with the large pharma companies but also some of the generic companies. Two, is we want to find unique products to put through these channels. And in that connection, there are opportunities in the areas such as instruments, where we acquired a company, Veterinary Instruments, (53:59) several years ago. And we're taking their products around the world and doing quite well with that.","The second is in the area of med surg products. We acquired KRUUSE out of Scandinavia. They do business in about 100 countries. And we're advancing their product offering and their market share throughout the world and particularly through the Henry Schein channels.","And then the third is equipment. And in that area, we include diagnostics. Equipment include, of course, imaging equipment, surgical equipment and the diagnostics. Under that category is also some disposable diagnostics. And diagnostics, in particular, tie into the third area, which is the area of software and the connectivity between software and devices and big data.","We've been investing in all those areas, not only in actual software providers, such VetRx (55:10) and the other companies we acquired over the last four or five years. And today, we have the largest installed base of practice management software in a number of countries, including the U.S., where over half the veterinarians are using our software. So, it's the installation software and data. And in that connection, we invested in Vetstreet last quarter, and we have a number of other opportunities to capitalize on data.","So, that's the broad strategy. Now to address diagnostics specifically, diagnostics is not necessarily about the machine, per se. It's about the intraoperability, the connection between the practice management software and diagnostics. We have invested in Axis-Q, which I think, when was it? We launched in January a year ago. Axis-Q is doing quite well in terms of market acceptance, and we expect more connectivity between Axis-Q to the reference lab and, of course, to the diagnostic machinery.","Bottom line is if you're asking about how we're doing specifically in North America, which is where you referred to a particular company not wishing to do business with us anymore, we actually had a very good first quarter, not only in the products we represent, the Abaxis and the Heska product, but also with the Skill (56:53) product offering, the company we acquired in Europe that has a line of connectivity products and its own products.","So, we're doing quite well in the diagnostics space in North America, and, by the way, in Europe as well. So, it's a broad strategy of geographic penetration and product penetration in terms or pharmaceuticals, the specialized areas that we've acquired a presence in and the technology area.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very helpful, Stanley. And then just a second question on dental, specifically, international dental equipment, maybe if you could comment the near-term pipeline just because you're going up against that really solid number from IDS in June 2015. And lastly, just any plans to validate PlanScan for Invisalign; I mean, you mentioned the interoperability, the other scanners that you're out there selling, 3M and 3Shape, are both validated. Thanks for your time, guys.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I think PlanScan will have all the appropriate connectivity. It's just a matter of time. Actually, we believe the PlanScan, the actual scanner, is pretty good, but we are open architecture. And we promote: the 3M product, which is very good, backed by a world-class company; 3Shape, which is high-tech, really on the edge of new technology; and the Planmeca Company, which has great products also in this space. So, we've got three, and we are likely to add more scanning products over time. I think all of these will be connected in one way or another to all of the major applications. Perhaps there'll be one big company that is not so open to open architecture. We don't know. But we are very much pro-open architecture, have always been at Henry Schein.","We are delighted to carry any product that any quality manufacturer has, whether it's in consumables, equipment, in high-tech and have always been pro-competition and open to open architecture. That's been the hallmark of Henry Schein since Henry opened the door and sold the first generic drugs in this country many, many years ago, decades ago. So we are comfortable with our offering for the dentists and for the dental laboratory.","We think we're making good progress in this country and abroad, and we see a huge opportunity for the digital space and had a very good quarter, both in the full systems globally and in the scanners globally and are very excited with the opportunity in the dentist office and in the laboratory.","Steven Paladino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me just add to the second part of your question on equipment backlog. So in North America, our equipment order backlog versus same time last year is up. It's up single digits, so that's good. We feel given the strong growth we had in Q1 of 13% equipment growth, having the order backlog also increase is good, but not surprisingly in international, the order backlog is a little bit down. I think you have to remember that last year was an IDS year. This year is not an IDS year. So we feel good about the equipment backlog internationally, given that it's not an IDS year, but it is a little bit lower than the prior year at the same time.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We have one final question coming from the line of Jeff Johnson.","Unknown Speaker","Morning. This is Jason (1:00:34) actually on for Jeff. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple for Steve, first, on the revenue side, some very good growth rates in Animal Health and Medical, even after normalizing for some of the agency buy-sell (1:00:44) shifting we saw this quarter, but hoping you can help us with how we should be thinking about the top line contributions from this shift over the balance of the year. Do you expect a similar benefit as to what we saw here in 1Q? And then the follow-up to that question would be how should we be thinking about the operating margin progression for the rest of the year, in light of these moving parts of the top line, as well as what seems to be maybe a step-up in stock comp here to start 2016?","Steven Paladino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director","Sure. So first on the sell side, we should see on the Medical side the normalized sales growth continue at a very healthy rate. And I said earlier, normalized somewhere in the high-single to low double-digit range is what we think is achievable. We should see the impact of the agency sales shift related to the Cardinal transaction decrease in Q2 and virtually go away beyond that.","Similarly, on the Animal Health side, we would see the growth that we experienced, which was 7%- and change, we'd like to see that continue. There might be a little opportunity for acceleration there. And the agency shift will probably continue for the next few quarters.","With respect to operating margin, the goal is still to get operating margin expansion for the full year. Now, we typically don't see much of it in Q1, for a number of reasons. But again, stripping out some of those unusual items, we did get 23 basis points of margin expansion in Q1. But we expect to get further operating margin expansion for the full year. And I'm trying to remember, Jason, (1:02:20) there was a third part to your question, but not sure I remember it.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. I mean, you hit on most of that there. Just actually one follow-up, if I could. The North American consumables performance, pretty solid, but it did slow against what we saw last quarter. Last quarter, just may be a bit above normal or maybe we ticked back down here in 1Q. But I know you mentioned this kind of in some of the prepared remarks, the market's still pretty solid, but how would you qualify end market at this point? I mean, are we seeing any softening versus 4Q, or are things still pretty stable and solid? And maybe any color you can provide on April would be helpful as well. Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Jason, (1:03:01) I think the markets for dental consumables are in the couple of hundred basis point growth. It's not much more than that at this stage, maybe a little bit more than 200 basis points. And it depends, again, on the mix. In some areas, we're growing faster than others. We may be picking up a little bit more market share here and there. But I think it is safe to assume that we're growing around twice the market rate, around that number, and the markets have been pretty stable for quite a while in North America.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you so much. It's helpful.","Steven Paladino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director","Yeah. Just specifically, patient traffic, as we said earlier, continues to be healthy. And that's more than just a dental comment. That's a dental, a medical, and an animal health comment, both domestically and internationally.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Steven Paladino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","There are no further...","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think \u2013 sorry, Operator?","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Operator. And thank you, everybody, for calling in. We did promise to end at 11:00. We're six minutes late. Sorry. But wanted to handle that last question and sorry to others that wanted to ask and we're just not able to accommodate. But please feel free to call Carolynne Borders, our head of Investor Relations at Henry Schein, 1 \u2013 what's the number, 843...","Carolynne Borders - Vice President-Investor Relations","It's actually 631-390-8105.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Or Steve Paladino at 631-843-5915. I can remember the number. So, thank you all for calling. We are quite optimistic about the markets that we're in, about Henry Schein's strategy, long-term strategy. We think we're executing well on our strategic plan. We're right in the middle of the 2015, 2016, 2017 strategic plan. I think we've positioned our management team well. We've made some changes that are really part of a progression in advancing our effectiveness as a team. We're very pleased with the heads of all of our different business units, all executing well. The Dental team, led by Jim Breslawski, is doing a very, very good job as well, and has for decades now; and Jim Harding, our Chief Technology Officer, and the software businesses all operating well.","Of course, there's no business that doesn't have challenges. We have challenges, and we're dealing with them. But the opportunities are exciting. Each one of these areas is chock-full of ideas, change, opportunity to take advantage of the change, the demographics, technology, the markets we're in. So we're very, very excited about our future and where we're heading. Thank you for your interest, and we'll be back in 90 days.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Henry Schein first quarter conference call. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the first quarter of 2014. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.","The contents of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 6, 2014. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. [Operator Instructions] With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to begin 2014 with a solid first quarter financial report despite severe weather conditions throughout much of the U.S. While we believe our U.S. sales in each of our business groups adversely impacted by weather, we are pleased with our first quarter EPS performance and to be affirming our 2014 financial guidance. In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our performance, and we are generally quite pleased with the performance of each of our business units and generally across the board, taking into account the weather-related issues. And so Steven will now take you through the specifics of the quarterly financial results, and I'll be back with some additional comments.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning. I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2014. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our prior year first quarter results included a onetime noncash expense related to the refinancing of the Henry Schein Animal Health debt. If you look at Exhibit B of this morning's earnings release, you can see a reconciliation of that onetime non-GAAP item to GAAP net income and EPS from continuing operations. So I'd like to begin by discussing a factor that affected our sales growth for the quarter. Our 2014 first quarter U.S. sales for Dental, Animal Health and Medical were negatively impacted by severe winter weather, as Stanley just mentioned. So while it's extremely difficult to quantify the precise impact, there are a few important comments I'd like to make about that. First, we do not believe that the weather conditions had any material impact on our equipment or our Technology sales in the quarter. Second, we estimate that the impact was in the range of 1% to 2% of our sales in both our Dental consumable and Medical businesses. Third, we believe that the Animal Health sales in the U.S. was impacted by a greater amount since the adverse weather conditions across most of the U.S., especially in the south, delayed the start of the parasiticide season.","Finally, with that as a backdrop, let me also mention that we have seen all of our U.S. businesses rebound in April, giving us confidence that the weather impact in Q1 was an anomaly.","So let's turn to the specific sales performance for Q1. Our net sales for the quarter ended March 29, 2014, were $2.4 billion, reflecting a 6% increase compared with the first quarter of 2013. This consists of 5.6% growth in local currency and a 0.4% growth related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.9% and acquisition growth was an additional 2.7%. You can see the details of all of our sales growth contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release.","If you look at the operating margin for the quarter, it was -- 6.5% was the operating margin for first quarter 2014, and that declined by 23 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2013. However, when excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, our operating margin was relatively flat and contracted only by 4 basis points.","I'd also like to point out that in the \"other income\" section of our P&L, included in the \"other, net\" line is a contractual payment of $4.2 million pretax or $0.03 per share from a European Animal Health supplier. This payment was due to a change to a nonexclusive sales model. Previously, it was an exclusive sales model. So while we continue to sell this product on a nonexclusive basis, we have also begun to distribute other brands in this product category.","If you look at our effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 31.2%, which is down from 31.9% in the first quarter of 2013 and is in line with our previous guidance. The lower tax rate is due to the implementation of ongoing tax planning strategies, as well as high earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rates. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 31% range for the remainder of the year. The net income attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2014 was $102.1 million or $1.18 per diluted share. This represented growth of 8.4% and 11.3%, respectively, compared with the first quarter of 2013 when excluding the onetime expense related to the debt refinancing that I previously mentioned.","Foreign currency exchange did not have any material impact on our EPS for the quarter.","If you look at some of the detail of our sales results, our Dental sales for the first quarter of 2014 increased by 8.9% to $1.3 billion. The 8.9% growth included 8.6% growth in local currencies and 0.3% gain related to foreign currency exchanges. If you look at the local currency internally generated sales growth, that was 3.5% and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.1%, which is primarily related to the completion of the BioHorizons and Arseus acquisitions. The 3.5% internal growth in local currencies consisted of 3.6% growth in North America and 3.3% growth in International. And both of these figures are local internal growth. I'll give you some detail behind each of the North American International sales growth results. The 3.6% local internal growth in North America included 0.8% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 15.7% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. Let me point out that the U.S. Dental equipment sales in the first quarter of 2013 were impacted by the medical device excise tax that accelerated sales into the fourth quarter of 2012. This resulted in a little bit of an easier comparison in the first quarter of 2014. The 3.3% local internal growth in the International Dental sales included 3.7% growth in Dental consumable merchandise and 2.4% increase in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. Remember that Easter and Passover holidays, as well as the IDS show, all occurred in Q1 2013 and that also made for a little bit of an easier comparison this year. And just to note, of course, Easter and Passover are in the second quarter this year and the IDS show is not in 2014 and scheduled for 2015.","Let me comment although there were several factors including the severe weather that I previously discussed that impacted our Dental sales growth in Q1, we continue to be very pleased with the overall performance. If we look at the Animal Health sales, there were $654.5 million in the first quarter, an increase of 2.4%, and that included 2% in local currencies and 0.4% in foreign exchange. If we look at the 2% local currency growth, it included a small decline of 0.4% in North America and 4.2% growth internationally. Again, the decline in the North American sales is largely attributable to the weather, which had a larger impact on the Animal Health business since adverse weather conditions, again, also delayed the start of the parasiticide season.","I'd like to mention that in previous quarters, we normalized our results for the North American Animal Health sales for the switch to agency sales. However, this quarter, it did not have any material impact on our sales for the quarter. Medical sales were $397.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 2.2%, which includes 2% local currency growth and 0.2% foreign currency exchange growth. In that 2% internal growth at local currencies, North America grew by 2% and International grew by 0.9%. Again, sales growth in the Medical business was impacted by the adverse weather conditions also, but despite that impact in Q1, we remain confident that our strategy of focusing on large group practices resulted in market share growth.","Turning to our Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $81.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 8.9%, and this included 8.6% local currency growth and 0.3% growth related to foreign currency exchange. The internally generated sales growth in local currencies was 6.2% and acquisitions contributed an additional 2.4%. Within that 6.2% growth, North America grew by 4.8% and International grew by 14.2%. Remember though, I mentioned last quarter that we are now selling a specific U.S. dental software product on an agency basis. Last year was a traditional sale and this year, it's now an agency sale. And while that change lowered our sales in the Technology and Value-Added Service business by about $3.8 million in the quarter, again, there was no change in the profitability of this product line. It's really just a switch to an agency sale. When you normalize results and take into account for the switch to an agency sale, our internal growth in local currencies was actually 11.2%, including 10.7% in North America. So we're really very pleased with the double-digit normalized sales growth in our Technology and Value-Added Services segment.","With respect to stock repurchase, we continue to repurchase stock, common stock in the open market during the quarter. Specifically, we repurchased 647,000 shares at an average price of $116.34, which translates to about $75.3 million in cash. The impact of this repurchase in the first quarter EPS was not material.","And to remind people, at the end of the quarter, we still have about $225 million authorized for future repurchases, and we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of our stock for the year 2014.","If you look at the balance sheet and cash flow, as is typical for us, our operating cash flow for the quarter was negative. It was negative by $55.2 million. That compares to a negative $38 million in last year's first quarter. And one of the reasons for the high negative cash flow in 2014 is that we did see the reversal last year of the inventory investments made related to the medical device excise tax that occurred last year.","Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was relatively flat at a little over 40 days or 40.8 days for the quarter, and our inventory turns for the first quarter also are relatively unchanged at 5.6 turns.","I'll just conclude my remarks by affirming our 2014 financial guidance as follows: for 2014, we expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $5.29 to $5.39, and that represents a growth of 7% to 9% over the actual 2013 results, again, excluding that onetime item. And as always, the 2014 guidance is for continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but not any future acquisitions. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Let me take a few minutes to provide additional detail on each of our business units. In doing so, I'd like to underscore the theme of our 2013 annual report, which shareholders recently received in the mail. That theme is Rely on Us, and it speaks to enhancing engagement with all 5 of our constituents, namely: our customers, our supplier partners, Team Schein Members, society and, of course, our shareholders. Let me start by reviewing our Dental business. Growth in North America was highlighted by equipment sales and service revenue, which posted robust internal growth in local currencies of 16%, albeit against a somewhat easier comparison to growth of less than 1% in the same quarter in 2013. The strong growth was evident across the board in our Dental equipment business. In our International Dental business, consumable merchandise growth accelerated sequentially with internal growth in local currencies of 3.7%. This is the highest we've seen in nearly 2 years. International equipment sales and service revenue, total growth was 11.7%, including 2.4% internal growth and was bolstered by strategic acquisitions.","Last December, Planmeca announced a strategic investments in E4D technologies, the manufacturer of our E4D chairside scanning and milling system. Today, the system is marketed under the PlanScan brand, and reception by the dental community to date has been quite positive. Henry Schein continues to exclusively distribute the E4D product, the PlanScan technology, in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Planmeca has a reputation as a well-respected innovative, multinational dental equipment manufacturer. The alignment with E4D is expected to help improve continued adoption of chairside industry, and a strong knowledge of manufacturing should open the door to greater capacity in developing new systems, primarily in the E4D facility in Texas. In addition, Planmeca is delivering benefits in terms of seamless integration with digital imaging technology used in many dental practices today, and we are very pleased with our PlanScan E4D sales growth for the first quarter of 2014, which continues to be one of our fastest categories. Let me just also add that the E4D system will integrate with many other brands as well, but we are very pleased with the progress that has been made from a manufacturing point of view and from a sales and marketing point of view with the now PlanScan system that we are selling in these specific markets for U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The first part of every year is a especially busy time for Henry Schein as we hold various national sales meetings. The Dental Special Markets meeting brought together about 125 Team Schein Members throughout the country and approximately 100 representatives from the 60 supplier partners. Our Dental Special Markets business focuses on large group -- large corporate accounts. These are the large groups, government agencies, dental schools and other institutions. As is true with all sales meetings, this event included presentations by company executives, breakout sessions, educational seminars and, of course, the supplier exhibit. Importantly, the meeting presented opportunity for Team Schein Members and our supplier partners to learn from one another. By interacting directly, we can be sure that our sales team has the best possible knowledge of the market we serve and the products we offer. Prominently featured at this year's National Sales Meeting for our corporate accounts in Dental Special Markets group was the implant product line from our recently completed acquisition, BioHorizons, and we are pleased that BioHorizons is performing slightly ahead of our expectations. And a lot going on in the Special Markets arena. In particular, very large accounts and there's a group of midsized accounts. And as you would expect, Henry Schein is breaking down these various accounts into appropriate categories and providing the appropriate specialty sales support, backed up by specialty marketing support and value-added services for these groups of accounts.","Certainly, we'd be happy to answer more questions on this in the Q&A. Let me now focus on the Animal Health arena. Although we face some challenges in the quarter due to weather here in North America, it's important to note that because we operate in a leadership position in an attractive market, we look forward to continued steady growth here in North America in the mid, potentially even towards the high single-digit in future quarters. These growth expectations are consistent with our previous comments and, of course, one has to take into account adjustments as one moves from GAAP sales to agency sales and back again. Indeed, during the first quarter, we were delighted to be named as the exclusive distributor in the U.S. for Iams' therapeutic line of dog and cat food solutions. Henry Schein shares a strong commitment to supporting animal nutrition and the veterinary care, and raising awareness of its vital impact on the overall pet market and pet health care in general. Our International Animal Health internal sales growth in local currencies during the first quarter was solid and was, in fact, the highest we have reported in 1.5 years. We saw particular strength in the U.K., Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Australia. And just at the close of the quarter, we announced the completion of the acquisition of approximately 80% of the shares of Medivet with annual sales of $86 million. As we have previously discussed, Medivet is the leading distributor of Animal Health products and services in Poland and provides a strategic base for expansion into Eastern Europe's growing Animal Health market.","Now in early March, we held our Animal Health National Sales Meeting. This 5-day event featured a record number of more than 600 Team Schein Members and participants from suppliers. As with Dental Special Markets Meetings -- as with the Dental Special Markets meeting, this forum included a multitude of training and educational sessions along with opportunities to learn about new products and services offerings from suppliers and a sharing of best practices. Really, another very, very good meeting. If we look forward to the fall, we recently announced we will be hosting the second annual Veterinary Technology Summit in early September. This is a particularly exciting industry event that combines practice management courses with training on our cutting-edge software for veterinarians and their staff and more. We take pride in the technology leadership for many reasons, not the least of which is that it strengthens the bond between Henry Schein and our customers and allows veterinarians to run efficient practices while providing the highest level of clinical care. We are proud to have a leading market position in the U.S. for installed systems and believe that more than 50% of companion animal clinics are using one of our many software systems, 2 major systems and other 3 or 4 other systems. Continuing with our commitment to advanced technology and practice efficiency, early in the second quarter, we launched a free iPad app for our U.S. Animal Health customers. This app includes features such as product search capability and purchase history and ability to browse and select from more than 17,000 products available on the Henry Schein website in Animal Health space. Our new mobile ordering app raises the bar for flexibility and convenience, and coupled with expert advice and tailored solutions we provide makes Henry Schein Animal Health a unique resource to our veterinary customers.","Let me now turn briefly to our Medical group. As I think everyone knows, North America represents 94%, about 94% of group sales. So it's primarily a U.S. business. Our strategic sales force for the past several years has been focused on large group practices and the IDN methodology, the IDN, integrated delivery networks. We are making solid progress with this strategy and are seeing positive results. Yet, I note that onboarding of these new accounts, these large accounts, generally takes longer than is for the small accounts or solo practitioners, so we're quite optimistic that this program, which has generated good interest amongst these larger accounts, specifically IDNs, will yield good sales results as the year goes by. At our annual Medical National Sales Meeting, more than 700 Team Schein Members, along with representatives from 145 exhibiting companies, gathered together to ensure our continued success in serving our physician customers. There's a lot of change occurring in this marketplace, and we believe we're still the fastest-growing provider of products to physician offices and alternate care sites. And we look forward to benefiting from the trends being driven by public policy as manifested by the Affordable Care Act, that are changing business models and deliveries of health care and as the movement towards wellness, the movements toward preventative care and the movement from the hospital to the alternate care sites, all we believe play well into our focus in the medical arena.","So let me conclude my business overview with some discussion on Technology and the Value-Added Services group. Growth in this unit was driven by software sales, which were good, and Value-Added Services. More if anyone has any questions. But generally, sales performance in this area was heavily driven by recurring revenue as we leverage and expand our relationship with our software customers. This group remains a very, very good contributor to profits, but, more importantly, to providing value-added services and stickiness in terms of relationship building with our customers.","So let me conclude. Some very good news, which I think many of our shareholders may be aware of. And I think these 2 points that I want to stress run to the success of Henry Schein, run to our corporate culture, which in the end has been the driver of success. The markets -- many of the businesses that we're in have lots and lots of competitors, and barriers to entry are relatively easy, but what has resulted in us being, we believe, so successful is our culture. We were recently recognized as 2014 World's Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute, which is an independent center of research promoting best practices and corporate ethics and governance. We're 1 of only 144 companies awarded this honor across 41 industries, 22 countries and 5 continents. This is the third consecutive year Henry Schein has received this award, which recognizes organizations that continue to raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior. Also, we were ranked first on Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies list for 2014 in the wholesale health care industry. According to Fortune Magazine, the World's Most Admired Companies list is the definitive report card on corporate reputations. We also are first in each of 9 subcategories of ranking, an accomplishment we never achieved before. This year marks the 13th consecutive year that Henry Schein was named on the Fortune Most Admired Companies list. I think we became a Fortune company 13 years ago.","So with that overview on our quarterly financial and operating performance, thank you for your attention. There's so much to talk about Henry Schein, so we'd be happy if shareholders or investors would like to ask specific questions about specific areas. So I'll turn the call over to the operator now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the North American sales. You guys highlighted equipment and clearly, some very strong growth there in what I imagine was a fairly tough environment in North America. You also, Stanley, highlighted the relationship with Planmeca and the satisfaction you guys have there around E4D product. I was wondering if maybe you could spend a little time discussing within equipment, what drove the significant growth in Q1. Just trying to get a better sense for how much of it was market-driven versus share gains.","Stanley M. Bergman","It's a very good question. There's no IMS data that is that accurate on the equipment side. But we believe that overall, the equipment market in the U.S. is doing better. We believe that we are much better positioned today than we've ever been to offer every kind of system that a practitioner may need. We believe we have an outstanding offering. Major suppliers are working quite well with us generally. Always room for improvement here or there. But overall, I think we are -- we've done well in traditional equipment and generally across the board in North America. So I mean please do remember, as Steven pointed out, that 2013 first quarter was a particularly challenging quarter. I think we only had 1% growth, but so if you take the 1% and you take the and another 16% or something like that, you add it together, 17%, it's still 8.5% internal growth or something like that, right? This is all internal growth, Steven?","Steven Paladino","Yes.","Stanley M. Bergman","It's quite good, it's 3x the GDP. Yes, I think we are gaining market share, we believe, in most categories, but we think the dentists are investing in their practices.","Steven Paladino","Yes. Let me just add, Bob, just to give a little more color. As Stanley said it, but to give you a little bit more detail, across-the-board equipment sales growth was strong. Traditional was in the high single-digit growth. High-tech was much faster than that, and it blended obviously to that 15.7%. And within high-tech, PlanScan, I think was one of -- it was either the highest or one of the highest product category. So PlanScan\/E4D did very well also. So really, it was broad-based and across-the-board, so we were pleased with that.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess just switching gears over to the international business, it sounded like consumables there was actually very strong. I was just curious if maybe you could talk about within Europe what pockets exceeded your expectations, and how are you thinking about the consumable growth across Europe for the balance of the year?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I think we've been saying this for a while. Europe is stabilizing not back to where it was, but I think it would be fair to say that there are not many markets that are in heavy decline or immediate decline. So the mood is a little bit better. Of course, there's challenges not the way it was, but generally practitioners can access funding. I think we have done, perhaps, a little bit better job in the marketplace, because our funding services, we've taken the Henry Schein Financial Services to Europe and that's doing quite well. But overall, I think the big markets Germany, France and the U.K. are okay. Please take into account that in the first quarter of 2013, we had the IDS impact. Some people didn't buy it because of holding off for the IDS to take into account, but generally those few markets are okay. Italy is still not good, but the 3 anchors are okay, and the rest kind of cancel each other out, but it's definitely leaning well into the positive category from a mood point of view, although there are, of course, challenges. Europe is still not completely back to where it was.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Stanley, just want to follow up on some of the comments that you made with respect to the U.S. I think you seem to suggest that consumable growth was maybe 0.8%, maybe weather sort of impacted that in the range of 1% to 2%. So as I think about growth in the U.S., is it kind of fair to say that normalized to weather, we're kind of in that 2% to 3% range, which really doesn't feel like it's gotten any stronger or any weaker from where we were trending in the past couple of quarters. And then just to kind of reconcile that to Bob's question around Europe, it kind of sounds like Europe clearly organically, it grew faster this quarter than the U.S, which is a definite change from where we were for the last couple of years.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, that's an interesting and obviously a very logical conclusion. When we're talking about such small basis point differences, it's very hard to make concrete conclusions. I think the U.S. economy we know is growing a couple of hundred basis points, and dentistry is about there and Henry Schein picks up a little bit of market share. So we do maybe a little bit better with some of the bigger accounts. Some say that, that's pricing issue in those accounts. Yes, but we also -- there are some pricing issues, but we get good support from manufacturers, and above all, I think we have the best systems in that field. So generally, I think we're doing Henry Schein little bit better than the economy, and so I think the U.S. is in the 2%, 3% range, it's definitely more than 2%, how much more than 3% it is, I don't know, but we're talking about those kinds of ranges, maybe a little bit better than 3% for the time being, and Europe had good equipment sales in there, but I think Europe is doing a tad better than we thought for the time being. Also, please, please remember the Easter affect. I hate to go into these little basis point adjustments, but you've got the weather, you got Easter, but we are comfortable that we're going to grow at the GDP plus 100, 200 basis points, something like that. That's what we've been talking about for years. We believe that our businesses are well positioned to do that.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe if I just follow-up with Steve, 1 question on the guidance. It kind of sounds like you had a pretty big beat here, at least on an EPS basis, and I listened to prepared remarks, it sounds like the acquisitions are doing well, you saw the business rebound in April, you know ultimately Animal Health, I think, Stan suggests it was going to rebound up to mid- to high-single digits. And so as I look at the range that you provided for the full year, it kind of implies decelerating growth, at least on an EPS basis throughout the balance of the year. I'm just trying to reconcile the comments with that expectation, and maybe it's just sort of 1Q and you want to remain on the conservative side here, but I'm just kind of curious if there's anything that will impact the growth over the past couple, I'm sorry, over the next couple quarters that are worth calling out.","Steven Paladino","Sure. So first, I think your last comment is true. I think it's still early in the year, and we want to have a little bit of a conservatism to our guidance. If you recall last quarter, I was saying that we thought EPS growth would accelerate beyond Q1. And if you look at the benefit we have on other income, which was about $0.03, we weren't expecting that to occur in Q1. It was part of our original guidance. It was either 1 or 2 things were going to happen when we gave guidance with that European Animal Health supplier, either we were going to continue the exclusivity, and that would have continued for the year, or the change would have occurred, which happened, and we weren't expecting that benefit in Q1. So really when you exclude that, our EPS growth was just under 9%, which is still at the high end of our full year guidance. And again, other than trying to be a little bit conservative, and it's early in the year, that was really the change in Q1 from what we thought would happen from a timing perspective the last quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, maybe I can start with you on the equipment side. On the traditional versus the high-tech break out that you gave on the growth rates, could you remind us kind of what percentage as you fill in buckets of traditional versus high-tech, what percentage of your North American Dental equipment would fall into traditional versus high-tech?","Steven Paladino","Sure. Generally, the traditional equipment runs about 60%, 65% of overall equipment in the high-tech as a balance. There is a little bit of variation between quarters, because sometimes the high-tech equipment accelerates at a faster rate, but that's a basic breakout that we typically see.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, fair enough. And then do you feel like with upper single digits on the traditional side, and I know the corporate business seems like it's helping you out this year a decent amount, but do you feel like you're taking share there across the industry on the traditional side. And then on the PlanScan side, I hear your numbers or I hear your comments that it was your first or second highest growth rate product in the quarter, is there any independent data out there or anything you could point to on a unit basis? Are you from a new system sale taking 10%, 15% of new system sales currently, higher, lower than that? Just anything you could ballpark would be helpful there as well.","Steven Paladino","It's -- I think we're definitely doing very well in PlanScan. It's really hard to tell how many units versus the competition, but it feels like we're accelerating our market penetration. There's really not good data on that, that I know off, so it's hard to say with certainty. We have the benefit this quarter that not only were we shipping new units on PlanScan, we also shipped a fair amount of upgrades, and we have the upgrade program for -- it wasn't a big part of our customer base that had the potential from upgrades, but it still did have an impact in Q1. And the good news is also we're not feeling like we're constrained from a supply point of view, we're feeling like the supply is now catching up to where it needs to be. So I still feel like PlanScan will be a very strong grower for the remainder of the year and into the future years also.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And your comments then if I could follow up on anything on traditional side if you feel like you're taking share, or even in the private practitioner channel there?","Steven Paladino","Yes. I think we have to be, because I can't believe that the market grew at high single digits on the traditional side. I Just can't believe it grew that high. So again, there's not good data on that, there is some data that comes out, but by the time it comes out, it will be 30 or 60 days from now, so we'll know at that point with some of the market data that comes out. But again, you know the market pretty well also, I doubt the market was growing high single digits in Q1 in traditional.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. Fair enough. Last question, Stanley, I think, over the years, you guys have had trouble finding any credible partners in Russia, I guess is one way to phrase it, but just to confirm, you don't -- no real exposure to Russia, Ukraine in some of the issues going on there?","Stanley M. Bergman","No, no. Anybody from Russia wants to buy, we'll be delighted to sell, but had to come to one of our operations in Europe or in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffrey.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First, in the Animal Health business, just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on what potential industry consolidation between Novartis Animal Health and Elanco might have on the business? And also there were a number of new products that were introduced this year, wondering if you've seen any benefit or any issues with supplies on next [indiscernible]","Stanley M. Bergman","2","Maybe Steven knows the specific products, but I really can't comment, they were reported on some board meeting, but I just don't remember. Look, we have a good relationship with both Novartis, and Elanco Eli Lilly, just been a very good relationship with both of them. We do not expect any significant impact to ourselves once the Novartis business becomes part of Lilly, and we expect Lilly to continue to support us and enjoy -- and we believe we'll enjoy the benefits of really outstanding relationship that we built with the Lilly Elanco team over the years, not only here in the U.S. but worldwide. We also had a very good relationship with Novartis, so I have to say that we are very pleased with this combination and believe it will be a benefit to the industry, and I believe Henry Schein will be a beneficiary of this too, so we're very pleased. But, of course, I think a lot of this will only have an impact in one way or another in 2015, because these are quite substantial companies from a Animal Health point of view, and there's going to be a lot of merger activity taking place. So I think there are going to be, my guess is internally focused for a while before they spend a lot of time advancing market share et cetera, but could not be happier.","Steven Paladino","So I was going to add with respect to the specific products you just mentioned, while I'm quite frankly, not familiar with those 2 specific products, I think I can say that I'm not aware of any significant product issue on the Animal Health side. So we can double check that for you, but I think if there was a significant issue I would have heard about it.","Stanley M. Bergman","The only issue in the Animal Health Care was the seasonality thing. That was a big issue because of the weather.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And you've seen improvement in April from the weather impact, is that correct, Stan?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. I'm not sure you can conclude that April is a trend, but April so far -- and we generally do not provide monthly guidance, but I think given the severe impact in the first quarter, we thought it was important to provide essentially what happened in April. And yes, it's not bad.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then just last question. On the medical business, we saw a little bit of internal growth this quarter in North America. As we move throughout the year with ACA benefit expanded coverage, are you expecting a ramp? And does your guidance -- have you built into your guidance a ramp in utilization and volumes that might drive incremental growth in that business?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I think we can't confirm specific numbers obviously, but I think from the tone we tried to convey perhaps, over the last 2 years or so, or even longer, we're quite optimistic that our position in the U.S. medical space, we decided to focus on consolidating entities, the large entities multiple locations under common management, as well as the IDN, these are the integrated delivery network systems. These are hospitals that are earning practices, et cetera. And we believe this is the rapidly growing part of the market, these two. And that's an area we focused on. We believe we're well positioned, we believe we're landing some very nice accounts. They take time to integrate, it's hard to tell the exact day when business moves over, but we've actually done quite well in winning some of these accounts, and believe we're in a very good position to serve these accounts. Exactly when the business comes, it's so hard to tell so we have to remain quite conservative. And so I think the Affordable Act will, in the end, result in many more Americans seeing a primary care physician, that is a fact. When this all kicks in, very hard to tell. But the part of the market that we serve will be servicing more, the practitioners will be seeing more patients in a preventative wellness setting, and that means more gloves and masks and all things that we sell. So we remain quite optimistic, but I think Steven rightly so has been quite conservative with our internal budgets, and I think that's where we are today. But in the long run, we believe this is a very good business to investment in from our point of view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to dig in a little bit more and follow-up on that question from ACA perspective. You talked about the utilization improvement. Steve, you said you saw a pickup in April, some of the utilization metrics you track, particularly if the weather seems to have thawed out a bit. And you also think about some of the earlier potential increased lives that are getting covered, it's Medicaid, it's people that maybe who not had insurance ever, and so something like basic medical requirements, something like a first dental visit, maybe the first place that they go. As you think about what could be the driver of utilization, are you seeing any of that maybe whether it's Medicaid expansion or some other areas that could very specifically be the early impacts from ACA that have already found their way into your book?","Steven Paladino","Again, it's so hard to tell. If you're asking us to guess, my guess would be we really haven't seen much of an impact yet, that whatever impact we'll have is still to come. Again, the reason why we really haven't factored anything into that in the 2014 guidance is because determining the timing of when that will happen is difficult. I think I personally believe that, that should help our medical, as well as a little bit to a lesser extent, our dental business, but I don't think we've seen any impact just yet.","Stanley M. Bergman","I agree with Steven. On the impact of the Affordable Act not yet in terms of the number of new patients. Having said that, I think the consolidation trends in the large group practices is a motive, and the IDNs has accelerated over the last couple of years. A lot of these providers were looking for new providers of products, and I think we've landed some nice accounts in those areas. Although, not all those accounted obviously have not been converted yet, because that takes some time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Could you expand a bit more on your dental specialty groups, and if you're willing, perhaps give us what kind of organic growth you're seeing in implants or filling [ph] end up?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. I'll leave the guidance, the information on the sales growth, and I'm not sure Steven, what specific numbers we provide. But generally, on the implant side, BioHorizons and the 2 big properties of BioHorizons and Camlog a little bit ace. BioHorizons is doing well. Again, not prepared to say it's a trend, but the first quarter has done quite well in terms of sales ability. Camlog, I think you know significantly German-focused. The German implant market did not really grow much last year, and we're seeing I think, our market share moving -- continuing to move in a good direction in Germany. So overall, our implant businesses are doing quite well. Orthodontics is really not material. I think we're doing quite well domestically in the U.S. and we expect to do well internationally over time and the endodontics on balance I think is more or less similar to the general dental trends. So overall, I think the organic side is perhaps being just a little bit better than our overall Dental business. And we will continue to invest in this area from an inorganic point of view as well. By the way, I will say, as I think this is true, that where we're doing particularly, well I think, is in selling equipment to specialists, because our sales force in the area of specialty products has had an impact on overall brand awareness of our equipment offering in the specialty area, and I think it's paid off well. And I'm particularly referring to the U.S. here.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","That's very helpful, Stan. And maybe just one quick follow-up. If you think about your corporate dental business versus the more traditional customer, are you seeing any differences in trends there?","Stanley M. Bergman","John, anything specific you're looking for as far as the question?","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, one specific, are the corporate buyers more likely and more comfortable making the larger capital equipment-type purchases?","Steven Paladino","Yes, the large corporate practices.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. I think that's, yes, they continue to do that. It's probably a little bit -- and last year, I think we saw a few portfolio changes among some private equity firms, but of management change, I'm referring to the U.S. and I think we're seeing a lot more interest in equipment now.","Steven Paladino","And remember, there are some of those corporate accounts that their model is not to buy new dental practices or maybe not to do that exclusively, but really to start up new dental practices. So those that have that model that do more startups than acquisitions, obviously, the bigger equipment buyers with traditional equipment, and there seems to be a lot of interest with the corporate accounts on technologies like PlanScan to improve efficiency, because they understand it. They tend to be a little cautious on overall capital expenditures, because they're using a lot of cash to grow the business, but I think that they're all looking very hard at improving efficiencies and their practices and CAD\/CAM is a big driver of that.","Operator","And we do have time for one more question. And your final question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe just 2 or 3 quick ones. First, Steven, the cadence of internal revenue growth for the balance of the year, last year was pretty stable in that 3.5% to 4% range. You had the slight step down in 2.9%, and you called that weather headwinds in 1Q. But is there a way that we should think about the cadence for the balance of this year?","Steven Paladino","The only thing that we should see a little bit -- Stanley mentioned the Easter passover holidays, which is in Q2. That tends to have a muted impact in the U.S., it has a little bit of an impact, but it tends to have a better impact in international, but there are some European markets that, for example, Good Friday is virtually a national...","Stanley M. Bergman","And the Monday.","Steven Paladino","Yes. And maybe even Monday, effectively national holidays, almost everything is closed. So we'll see a little bit of that in Q2, but other than that, and other than our typical strength in equipment and technology sales in Q4, a little bit tax-related, I would say no other things to note on that.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just next on the -- call it adjusted dental consumable number in North America. It seems like earlier reference, even if you make some adjustments maybe it was up 2% to 3% in 1Q and arguably that was off of somewhat of an easier comp from a year ago. Last quarter, you talked about maybe 4% was back. Are you still thinking in and around that number, in other words, for balance of the year are you seeing the underlying demand in North America in and around the 4% dental consumable number?","Steven Paladino","I don't want to be that specific on 4%. By the way when we look at demand, our consumable business, we look at trends, because unlike equipment, we get an order today, we're shipping it today. So there's no backlog, there's no -- so the way to look at how is the business doing is to look at the trend line of average daily sales and compare it to other periods. Now, unlike equipment where we know, for example, we feel very good about equipment going forward, because we have the backlog report, and if you look at our U.S. backlog report, it's grown from the end of the quarter to the -- from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter in Q1, so that you have a little bit more where you can -- predictability. But I do think that overall, we should see the markets return to normal as we said we saw April results rebound in all of our businesses. So we were pretty confident, the weather was a negative impact there. And I think that even though we haven't really seen it, it's hard to tell in Q1, we should see a little bit of I think market improvement as the year progresses.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And very last one. I know you guys have a million products, but your partner on this one actually had a conference call specific to it. So any color on realign. I mean, there's been some clarity in Align's [ph] numbers that maybe got off to somewhat of a slow start, if you just isolate their express-type of product growth. Can you guys speak to that, Stan, what your sales guys are seeing with it out there. It's obviously a very big market opportunity being the clear align [ph], I don't know how do you see the traction with that product going forward?","Stanley M. Bergman","I don't have the specifics, and I'm not sure if we really should comment on specific products, because it's clearly not material to the whole of Henry Schein. Although it's a very nice product for us to provide a value-added service to the GPs. I know our sales force was excited, I know that we will be doing quite a bit around this product in our national sales meeting, when is that July?","Steven Paladino","Yes.","Stanley M. Bergman","But I don't have the specifics. And, I don't know if...","Steven Paladino","I don't have the specifics either, but I would say, the comment that slow start, I think you have to have a backdrop that this is a sale that's a longer sales cycle. So it's not unusual to start a little bit slow, because it takes a little bit more time to get the training and to get the customers to ultimately start buying. So it is a little bit of a longer sales cycle, so maybe that's consistent what you're hearing, but it's just a different way of I guess, explaining it.","Stanley M. Bergman","So thank you for all those questions, everyone. And thank you for participating. We continue to feel pretty good about the company, each of our business units has very good plans executing more or less to those plans with a couple of things ahead, and couple of laggards here and there. But overall, the company's good. We are using 2014 to prepare our strategic plan for years 2015, '16 and '17. And that is well underway. So I think the momentum is good. The economies generally are moving nicely in a positive direction, and we remain cautiously optimistic for the rest of the year, and thank you very much again for calling in.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's third quarter results. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.","The contents of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 5, 2013. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. [Operator Instructions]","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Solid growth in sales and earnings during the quarter reflects our strategy of organic growth, complemented by strategic acquisitions and our ongoing commitment to controlling expenses. Once again, we believe a positive indicator of the continued success of our diversified strategies is that we have gained market share in each of our businesses. We're also pleased today to be affirming 2013 financial guidance while introducing guidance for the year 2014 diluted EPS that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared with the midpoint of our 2013 range. So we are pleased with the performance of the company in general. The sales reflect a continued market share growth in each of our business units, Dental, Medical, Animal Health. And we're pleased that we are able to reaffirm guidance for the remainder of this year for next quarter and introduce the guidance for 2014 of 10% to 12% growth.","I'll provide additional commentary on our performance a little bit later, but let me now ask Steve to review our quarterly financial results.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I'm also pleased to report solid results for the third quarter of 2013. As we begin, I'd like to note that our third quarter results include certain onetime items. The net impact of these 2 items on our GAAP results is a positive $0.01 per diluted share. The first of these items is a one-time charge of $12.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share related to the previously announced divestiture of a noncontrolling interest in a dental wholesale distributor in the Middle East. We separately have talked about that and it occurred during the third quarter. I'll also point out that there is no tax benefit on that loss.","Second, our Q3 results include a benefit of $13.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share related to an overseas tax restructuring that will allow us to utilize tax loss carry forwards in the future to reduce future tax obligations. We have prepared our commentary excluding these items and so we think these one-time items, it is more comparable to show the effects excluding them and we will refer to our adjusted net income and adjusted EPS when excluding both of these items. If you look at Exhibit B of this morning's news release, it contains a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP income and GAAP to non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations.","So now turning to our sales for the third quarter. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 28, 2013 were $2.3 billion, reflecting a 5.3% increase compared with the third quarter of 2012. This consisted of a 5.2% growth in local currency and a 0.1% growth related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 3.4% and acquisition growth also contributed an additional 1.8%. Again, you could see the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release.","The operating margin for the third quarter was 6.8% and expanded by 13 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2012. This was primarily driven by a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of sales which was partially offset by a lower gross margin due mostly to product mix. We also like to show the impact of our margin, excluding the impact of current-year acquisitions that were completed during the past 12 months, as well as the impact of flu vaccines from both periods. And when you do that, our Q3 operating margin expanded by 20 basis points which was in line with our expectations.","If you look at our tax rate for the quarter, the reported tax rate was 21.7%. However, if we exclude the impact of the benefit of the overseas tax adjustment that I just mentioned, the effective tax rate on a going forward basis or on a continuing basis was 30.1%, which is down slightly from the third quarter of 2012, down 0.4%. But it is in line with the guidance that we gave last quarter and we do expect our effective tax rate to continue to be in that 30% range or maybe even slightly below for the balance of the year.","If you look at net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter of 2013, it was $107.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share. Excluding the 2 items I just mentioned, our adjusted net income for the quarter was $106.5 million or $1.22 per diluted share and that represents growth of 10.1% and 13.0%, respectively, compared with the third quarter of 2012 on a non-GAAP basis. Again, you can look at Exhibit B for the details of those comments. I'll also note that the foreign currency exchange fluctuations did not have a material impact on our EPS for the quarter.","I'd also like to provide some details on our sales results for the third quarter. If we look at Global Dental sales for the third quarter of 2013, we have shown an increase of 5.7% to $1.2 billion and that consisted of 5.2% growth in local currency and a 0.5% gain related to foreign currency exchange. The local currency internally generated sales growth was 3% and acquisition growth was 2.2%, totaling that 5.2% local currency growth. If we look at the internal growth of 3% in local currencies that was comprised of 4.8% growth in North America, so very strong growth in our North American business and a slight decline in the International business of 0.1%.","Let me now go through some of the details behind each of the North American and International results. The North American growth of 4.8% included 3.4% growth in Dental consumable merchandise sales and 9.9% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. We're really very pleased with the North American Dental equipment sales growth for the quarter approaching 10%. Our International Dental sales at 0.8% -- included a 0.8% decline in consumable merchandise but also a 1.4% increase in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. We continue to believe that our International Dental market is stable and we're hopeful that we'll see improvement in the not-too-distant future.","Our Global Animal Health sales were $642.3 million in the third quarter, an increase of 7.4%. This included 8% growth in local currencies and a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internal generated sales growth was 5.9% and acquisition growth was an additional 2.1% which was primarily related to the C&M Vetlink acquisition.","If we look at the 5.9% internal growth in local currencies, it consisted of 10.4% growth in North America, so double-digit growth in North America and 2.1% growth in International. We've shown over the last few quarters normalizing our sales growth results in North America to account for the switch from agency sales to normal traditional sales. And when we normalize our sales growth results in North America, that growth was 4.8%. And we believe we gained market share in this business unit also.","Turning to Global Medical sales, they were $444.5 million in the third quarter. That's an increase of 0.5% which consisted of 0.3% growth in local currencies and 0.2% growth related to foreign exchange. There was no acquisition activity during the quarter that contributed growth. It's important, I think, to look at our growth, the components of it. If you look at North America, which is the lion's share of our medical business, we did have 0.5% growth and we did see a decline of about 5.8% but on a small base in International.","It's also important to note that influenza vaccine sales were lower this quarter than in the prior-year quarter. So for us, that's a timing impact, lower sales this quarter. We do expect those sales to occur in Q4. And if we exclude the impact of the flu vaccine sales, our Global Medical sales growth for the quarter was 2.6%, with 2.4% growth in local currencies and 2.8% growth in North America. It's also important to note that we really don't have any risk related to flu vaccine sales. Since through today, we have essentially sold all of our commitments of approximately 8.3 million doses for the season. So you'll see the rest of those sales occurring in Q4. And again, we believe we gained market share in the North American Medical market which we believe was flat to slightly down in Q3.","Turning to Global Technology and Value-Added Services sales, the sales were $78.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 11.2%. This included 11.8% growth in local currencies and a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency exchange. The local currency growth included internal sales growth increase of 8.5% and acquisition growth of 3.3%. If you look at the components of that 8.5% internal growth, 7.3% was in North America and 16.2% was the growth internationally. And we continue to be very pleased with our sales growth in the Technology and Value-Added Services business.","We also continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the third quarter. More specifically, we repurchased approximately 730,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $102.74 which was approximately $75 million of cash. That current buyback, the impact of the repurchase on our second quarter was not material. At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $74 million of authorized for future repurchases and we do expect to continue to repurchase our stock and probably use up the balance of that $74 million by year-end.","If we look at some of the highlights of the balance sheet and our cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $152.8 million and that compares to $78.5 million in last year's third quarter. And we continue to believe we'll generate strong operating cash flow for the balance of the year. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 41.6 days and that's comparable to 41.1 days last year. And inventory turns was 6.2 turns, which is also comparable to the 6.3 turns last year.","Let me just conclude my remarks by discussing our guidance for 2013 and 2014. For 2013, we are reaffirming our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $4.86 to $4.91 and this represents a growth of 9% to 11% compared with 2012 results. And that's comparing it to 2012, excluding restructuring costs. The guidance for 2013 continues to exclude the one-time items in the current year and those one-time items are noted on Exhibit B. Also, our guidance, as always is for continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but not for any future acquisition activity.","If we look to next year, we are introducing 2014 financial guidance as follows. For 2014, we expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $5.37 to $5.47 per share and that represents 10% to 12% growth versus the midpoint of our 2013 guidance range. Again, this 2014 guidance is for continuing operations including any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include any future acquisition activity, if any.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Let me now take a few minutes to provide some additional details on each of our business units. So starting with Dental group, the Global Dental group, our third quarter gains in the North American Dental sales were highlighted by nearly 10% internal growth in local currencies for equipment sales and service revenue which is up sharply from the 1.4% growth we reported in the previous quarter. This growth was driven by higher sales of traditional Dental equipment and E4D. We believe our CAD\/CAM category is poised to do well.","The North American Dental Consumables merchandise growth was in line with the previous quarter when adjusted for the benefit from timing of various holidays, as we discussed last quarter. Again, we believe we are gaining market share and continue to gain market share on the consumables side in North America and of course, on the Dental equipment side.","Our International Dental equipment internal sales in local currencies increased slightly following the strong second quarter that benefited from the biennial IDS meeting in Germany, in Cologne. And while International Dental consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies declined due to the challenges primarily in Australia related to a reduction in government funding for certain patient procedures, it also represents strong growth related to acquisitions. So we believe, in Europe, we continue to gain market share and I think the same could be said in Australia. Having said that, the Australian Dental market saw a reduction because of the changes in government funding which we're hopeful will reverse itself with the new government in the near future.","During last quarter's call, I discussed at length the unveiling of the E4D NEVO Scanner and Design Center at our National Dental Sales meeting. Since then, we have been introducing this exciting product which represents a new level of precision, proficiency and productivity in the CAD\/CAM category. In late September, we began a commercial rollout and the customer response has been really very, very good. Dentists recognize the many benefits of E4D NEVO, including speed and ease of use. We are also pleased that Aspen Dental will be using NEVO technology in their practices.","We do expect strong sales of E4D NEVO systems in the fourth quarter, although there is a possibility that the growth could exceed the ability to provide systems as the growth is looking quite good at this time and we may have to deliver some in the fourth quarter -- in first quarter next year, although we do expect the sales to be quite strong in the fourth quarter as well.","I'd like to remind you that, please remember this, that last year's fourth quarter, we had exceptionally strong growth in the North American Dental Equipment business, nearly 22%, which was fueled by various tax concerns. So while we fully expect to report positive growth in our North American Dental equipment business during the fourth quarter, it'll be on the heels of a 22% growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the rate, obviously, will be lower than prior year due to the difficult comparison. And we've covered this in the last couple of calls. Having said that, just let me reiterate that we believe our Dental equipment business is doing very well and continues to gain market share in North America.","Staying with our Dental equipment business for another minute. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we announced the expansion of our geographic presence to the African continent with the acquisition of a minority ownership position in the Dental Warehouse. Dental Warehouse has a very good brand, essentially at this time a consumables business which we hope to expand into the equipment field into the near future.","The Dental Warehouse organization is headquartered in Johannesburg. It is a leading distributor, as I noted, of Dental consumable merchandise to dentists, and to private clinics, the universities and government agencies in South Africa. They're rather -- relatively small beginning from the Henry Schein overall point of view, about $10 billion -- $10 million, sorry, in sales annually and the company offers branded consumer products and enjoys number of exclusive relationships with multiple suppliers. We expect to expand the business by adding additional Schein products and expand the presence of the business north of Johannesburg into the African continent. We also have the option within a short period of time to increase our ownership position to that of a majority position and we'll do that at some point in the future.","So this is a strategic transaction for Henry Schein as we continue to expand our global footprint and specifically into the developing world. So we started out in Hong Kong. We then expanded into China. We made our very successful investment in our Thai joint venture, which is going well. And now, our expansion to Africa continent. We believe that the opportunity for oral care in the developing world is quite good and Henry Schein is ideally positioned given our product offering and knowledge base, from a management point of view, to expand into the developing world over time.","Let me now take a look and discuss a bit about our Global Animal Health business which continued to perform well during the quarter. North American internal sales performed slightly above our expectations for growth in the high single-digits. We recorded particularly strong sales during the quarter of parasiticide products. In addition, we are delighted to return to positive internal growth in local currencies in the International Animal Health arena with modest growth in most countries we serve. Again, I think we're comfortable that we continue to gain market share in each -- both in North America in, shall we say, the U.S. in Animal Health and Europe and as a Global business.","Let me take a moment here to comment on our Global Animal Health business on perspective of increasing presence in that market. In the third quarter of 2013, our Global Animal Health business represented approximately 27% of our worldwide sales, behind only Global Dental among our business segments. As recently as 2008, our Global Animal Health business represented only approximately 13% of our global sales. We are extremely pleased with the success we have had in growing our worldwide footprint in this important market through a combination, of course, of acquisitions and good organic growth. And in our ability to improve profitability, this has also been a hallmark of this group, while doing so through an effective sales and marketing strategies and of course, our Henry Schein distribution expertise.","Let me now turn to the Global Medical group, which is essentially our U.S. Medical business. While we continue to make inroads in the IDN networks, the Integrated Delivery Networks, urgent care settings and ambulatory surgery centers, we do believe that patient traffic to U.S. physician offices was slightly down during the quarter compared to recent trends. However, we really feel that our big opportunity lies in the larger practices and remain confident that our focus on large practices will allow us to continue to gain market share and we expect growth to be higher in the fourth quarter as we bring on some additional larger customers. This business of large customer onboarding can be lumpy from time to time.","So let me just conclude with the seasonal flu, conclude on the medical side. We sold approximately 3 -- 6.3 million doses of seasonal flu vaccines during the third quarter. And as of today, I think Steven mentioned already, approximately 8.3 million doses. And this represents essentially all of our season supply. As previously mentioned, our sales of flu vaccines were lower this quarter. So it's very important to look at our medical sales, excluding flu, as the flu vaccine shipped really in the months significantly of September and October. So this year, we shipped less in September and more in October. But as we, I think, indicated on earlier calls, we did expect the profit margin to be higher and indeed, the profit margin was good this year, a little bit higher than last year.","So now, let me conclude with a business overview, with our Global Technology and Value-Added Services businesses. Sales growth in those business units continue to be strong and in particular, on International side. Once again, growth was driven by the electronic services reoccurring revenue and, to some extent, software sales.","So before we take questions, I'd like to speak for a moment on a topic that we at Henry Schein take rather seriously, and that is our Corporate Social Responsibility. Our commitment to being a good corporate citizen is shared by all Team Schein members globally and it's really at the heart of our culture and enables us to align our interests with those of our customers and our suppliers and enable the company to do well by actually doing good. It's a key part of the success story at Henry Schein. And we've had some really good brand recognition in this regard, but also had the opportunity to make a difference in many parts of the world.","And in an effort to support our Corporate Social Responsibility focus in the third quarter, we celebrated the dedication of the Dr. Musa Bajali Henry Schein Care Education Center at Al-Quds University in the Palestinian Authority, promoting educational research and clinical programs in dental medicine. And we participated in the National Health Center Week with the National Association of Committee Health Centers, an important partner in our efforts to provide high-quality care across the United States and particularly in underserved communities.","This weekend, this past weekend, at the American Dental Association meeting, we were once again recognized as one of the founders and drivers of the award-winning and most successful American Dental Association, Give Kids A Smile program. Our Home Health program provides full-spectrum medical and oral health support, including supplies, equipment and client health records, software and influenza vaccine programs.","So I could go on and on and on talking about this, but the Henry Schein brand recognition today stands at an all-time high and I believe a large part of that of course is driven by our quality service and our terrific field sales and telesales organizations who deliver and who are supported by our services team that deliver on the commitments made by the sales force. But I do believe our corporate social responsibilities at Henry Schein Cares program are adding to our brand recognition.","And as a final comment, I'd like to remind you that we'll be hosting an Analyst Day, an Investor Day in New York City on December 11. The event will run from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and institutional and analyst attendees must register in advance. For those of you not participating in person, the entire event will be available via webcast at henryschein.com. So lots and lots of activity going on at Henry Schein. We believe that the financial operating performance of the company is good. Actually, it's quite solid and we'd like to thank you for your attention this morning and also, of course, thank the team that is delivering on these very good results.","Now, operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Stanley, just wanted to start on the Medical segment. You shared again that you gained share across all your businesses and I would assume that obviously includes the Medical segment. The growth there, even when adjusted for the flu, certainly looked like it decelerated. The growth, that is, decelerated a bit from what we've been seeing. Any more details you can share with us on what you're seeing within North American Medical, specifically maybe as it relates to the changes in the competitive landscape?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, Bob, I think we've mentioned this in previous calls. I think it's not the right thing to view the Medical growth quarter-to-quarter because the onboarding of these larger accounts can be quite lumpy. So I think it's better to take a several quarter approach. And I'm quite comfortable that we continue to gain market share in both the smaller practices, which of course there are less of, as well as these newer enterprises of size, whether they are IDN, or whether they are large multi-specialty or single-specialty group practices. And I think we are well positioned to service this new landscape that is emerging. I think the traffic to the physician environment went down. I think it probably didn't go down a material way, but it was down. But again, I don't view that as the leading indicator of our success -- our ability to keep pace with the market adjustment for patient traffic, I don't view that as the measure of our success. What I view as the measure of our success is the ability to convert these larger groups to Henry Schein, whether it's IDNs or group practices. In that context, I think we're doing well. As for the competitive landscape, I don't think much has changed. It's really a couple of large players that are fighting for the business based on value-added services, and I think we have very good value-added services driven by terrific computer platform, an IT platform and tied into our supply chain capabilities that gives these larger practices what they're looking for. We've always been pretty good with the small practices, essentially through our telesales, field sales and direct mail businesses. But the real fight and opportunity for the future is with these large practices, and I think we're well positioned and I would encourage analysts to talk to some of the large groups and some of the large hospitals and just find out how we're doing. And I think the comment I made will be collaborated -- corroborated, shall we say.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's fair. And then if I could just move over to Dental, some exciting announcements around E4D in the quarter with NEVO and Aspen. Specifically as it relates to the Aspen agreement, can you share anymore specifics around this opportunity? As we think about roughly 400 practices, how much of that would you expect to place E4D with? And then taking a step back around the CAD\/CAM market, any overall comments you can share with us as far as CAD\/CAM market growth and market share changes that are going on recently?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. As to the number of units that Aspen will place, I think it's far too early to tell. Suffice this to say that of the large group practices, the DMOs, Dental Management Organizations, Aspen is one of the first to take CAD\/CAM very seriously. There are 1 or 2 that have already advanced the ball, but I would say Aspen is taking it quite far. And this is the first opportunity for a DMO to really look at E4D compared to competitive products. I would say, the 1 or 2 other group practices that are working in CAD\/CAM, when they decided to move into CAD\/CAM, E4D was really not ready. So this is the first time E4D really has competed heavily for a DMO's business, and we won the business based on product benefits and features and the overall technology, advantages of the technology, so we're quite pleased with that. As it relates to CAD\/CAM, I think Wall Street needs to be a little careful. It's not about chair side only. Of course, that's a key part of it, it's -- CAD\/CAM is much more than that. It's about the automation of the laboratory, the whole digitalization of prosthetics, and that's an area that Henry Schein is very much focused on. We are as focused on that as we were, for example, with sensors. I would say, 7 or 8 or 9 years ago we said, we wanted to be the biggest player in sensors, and I believe today, we sell more image sensors than anyone else. The same can be said of 3D. And we are very, very committed to the CAD\/CAM space, whether it's chairside, or as I mentioned now, the important segment of the lab. And there's a lot going on there. There are many new ones out there: Sensors, scanners for CAD\/CAM, quite a few software systems out there, both for the chairside and the lab, and many, many MLS. So it is our job at Henry Schein to advance our open architecture and be the one-stop shop in a market that today is a little bit confused. Dentists understand the importance of CAD\/CAM, but are not sure where to go. So we will do what we've done before when we introduced software almost 2 decades ago, and be the first to come out with a really good priced software that had national service that's supported by a well-capitalized company. We did the same with sensors, we did the same with 3D, and now CAD\/CAM presents this huge opportunity. But it is confusing because there are a lot of products out there, and one must be careful not to view this whole space as just a chairside space. This chairside, of course, it's important, it is the laboratory and it is the materials.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Krieger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Stan, maybe just a quick follow-up to Bob's question. Can you give us a sense, looking at your North American Dental equipment business, kind of relatively growth rates of CAD\/CAM imaging and the more basic categories?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, on specifics, let me turn it over to Steven.","Steven Paladino","Yes. So, John, we saw really across-the-board strong growth. We had strong growth in traditional equipment, we had strong growth in high-tech equipment. In high-tech, our strongest growth category was E4D for the quarter. But the variation, if you look at traditional equipment, it was right around that 10% range also, and high tech was a bit above that because of the strong E4D sales growth. So again, really across-the-board growth in all equipment categories.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Excellent. On the consumable side, how is the specialty part of the market doing for you versus the general practitioners?","Steven Paladino","So I think we're doing well in Specialty. Remember, some markets, implants in Europe is under a lot of pressure. We continue, I think, to do better than the market. We are growing in the U.S. in implants and other specialty things. I just would caution though, John, remember, our total Specialty sales business globally is $400 million, plus or minus. So even though we're doing nicely there, it's still off of a relatively small base compared to our overall sales, but we certainly feel we are taking market share in that product category.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then maybe just one quick one. You've given us some comments on sort of your perception of patient traffic trends in medical. Are you seeing any changes in the dental and vet markets for foot traffic?","Stanley M. Bergman","I think both those markets, it's quite stable. On the dental side, I think it's relatively stable. On the animal health, I would say it's stable, but there are some reports that it's in the positive area, and I think there are some reports that indicate some of the large practices may be down in terms of traffic. But on balance I think in both those markets, it's pretty stable, with sales growing just a little bit more than the GDP, maybe 3-plus-percent.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Let me just follow up, I guess, on John's question there on the consumable side of the dental business. Steve, wondering if you could give any color on, maybe, price versus volume mix in the quarter and how you're thinking about volume trends, especially in the next year you'll lose maybe 100 to 150 basis points of pricing tailwind into next year. So do you think volume growth can kind of backfill that and keep you in the 3% to 4% range on the consumable side?","Steven Paladino","We do. And we do feel that a big chunk of our sales growth is related to price increases that are standard in the market every year. We've consistently said that throughout the years, dental price increases range maybe from 2% to 2.5% per annum. This year really was no different -- sorry, this year was a little bit different because of medical device excise tax. But we believe that the patient traffic in procedures is relatively flat in the U.S. market. And we do believe that we have potential to see that market expand to get some additional growth in procedures, and then obviously, that'll drive our consumables sales growth. So we feel comfortable that sales growth will not decline because price increases might be a little bit less next year. If anything, we're a little bit more optimistic than that because we do believe that the markets have greater potential, especially in the U.S., to show some acceleration. Again, that's not something that we're baking into our guidance, but we do believe that, that potential is pretty strong right now.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. Great. And then on the working capital front, Steve, you mentioned that you'd expect operating cash flow to stay strong in the fourth quarter. Wondering how much you expect to work inventory down this year in fourth quarter versus last year in the fourth quarter? And really trying to feel out, I know last year, ahead of med tech tax, you bought forward some extra inventory, I think on both consumables and the equipment side. Can you just remind us how much in a typical year you buy forward? How much last year did you buy, an extra week's worth of inventory, things like that? Just trying to size that a little bit.","Stanley M. Bergman","Okay. Well, last year, because of the medical device excise tax, we bought approximately an additional $150 million of inventory. It wasn't all in the fourth quarter, some of it was in the third quarter. But by the year end we had an additional $150 million worth of inventory, really because we thought it was a good financial return because of the medical device excise tax. But our normal volumes, my guess would be will be consistent year-to-year, but we should show that decrease of $150 million at the year-end versus the year-end last year. And you've got to normalize for acquisitions and things like that, but on the core business, that should be the result.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, I was just trying to remember, and I don't know that you ever broke it out, but what that $150 million, how much of that, maybe was skewed towards Dental consumables versus Dental equipment on the North American business?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, it was skewed much more towards consumables, but I don't have the exact breakout. And the reason being, just because of cube size, it was easier to store the consumables rather than to store large equipment. So it was very much skewed towards consumables.","Operator","The next question will come from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Stanley, just want to follow up on some of the comments you made. I mean, when I look across all your major business lines, you see a pretty historic prevailing trend of the U.S. businesses seem to be doing very well, maybe even better than expected. While on a relative basis, the European or the International segment results, probably a little more anemic, and I think in your prepared remarks, you suggested that Europe is stable. And so I guess what I'm trying to ask is, if I look to your fiscal '14 guidance, what sort of embedded assumptions have you made about your domestic and international segments within that guidance?","Stanley M. Bergman","It's a good question, Glen. I think it's -- without getting to granular, it's our sense that the Dental market continues to be growing at low single-digits here in North America and is down slightly in Europe. Not a lot, but slightly, and it could tip into positive. And Australia is the one that's been quite a bit down. And I don't think we're going to bake too much positive into it, but I do believe there's an opportunity that the government will reinstate the reimbursement methodology that I think they had promised. On the Animal Health, the U.S., I think, is somewhere north of 3% to 4% internal growth. I'm talking about companion [ph], and maybe down slightly. But again, in both markets we -- and dental, we would hope to continue to gain market share. I think we have to be careful in the Animal Health because there was some softness in the parasiticides product category related to timing this year, so you have to take that into account when looking at the markets. Steven will be happy to give you more color on that. And the medical market, I'm not sure if it's growing, but the opportunity for Henry Schein to gain market share is very strong. So I think -- we will hope to continue to grow in mid-single-digits in that space without giving specific guidance, because I think we shouldn't do that. But that's sort of our hope, maybe a little bit higher. So and then if you pepper that with our continued growth in the technology in the value-added services area, that should also add with -- and that's higher margin, that should add to our profitability for next year. So that's sort of the kind of thinking. Our budget for 2014 is not done from a micro point of view, but from a macro point of view, but that's the kind of thinking. Maybe Steven, you want to add some additional color?","Steven Paladino","Yes. So I think it's important to note there's a difference on how we prepared our guidance, versus what we believe could happen in the markets. So to be specific, we prepared our guidance really assuming that in all markets, we would see stable conditions, maybe with a slight improvement more geared towards the North American market than the International market. However, we do believe that, that is being conservative. We do believe that the North American markets, both in dental and in veterinary, could see -- the potential was there to see a little bit faster growth in the markets than what we're assuming, although, again, we want to be conservative in our guidance. And really, we think that international, while it's less likely to happen in 2014, because it just may take a little longer, there is the opportunity for some better market conditions, maybe even in the tail half of 2014. But again, because the timing of exactly when that happens and because it's really impossible to predict, our guidance is really geared toward being a little bit more conservative on market conditions than what we think is likely to happen. The same thing would be true when you look at foreign exchange. We took a slightly conservative position on exchange rates in our guidance. No one really, I believe, knows exactly which way that's going to go, but we tried to be conservative on that. And I'm not trying to paint a picture that we're being ultraconservative, we're not. But we do have slight conservative -- conservatism built into our guidance because of the uncertainties and the unknowns in the marketplace.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I appreciate all that detail. Maybe if I could just ask one quick follow-up with respect to the company's acquisition strategy. Stan, on this call you talked about new markets like Hong Kong and Johannesburg, and it's clear the company has obviously been on a pretty feverish pace in terms of acquisitions the last several years. And while it doesn't seem like you're constrained from a balance sheet capacity perspective, I'm just kind of curious to get your view on the sustainability of the pace of acquisitions, given the management depth and whether you think the company can basically just sustain its current pace?","Stanley M. Bergman","We -- I think I mentioned this in the last call. We continue to be rather bullish on the ability to close on acquisitions. For 2013, as of this point in time, we have not closed on anything, in the aggregate, deals of substance. Whereas, we cannot commit that we're close on any deal, because deals are only closed when they're actually closed, we still are very much committed to our formula of taking about 1\/3 of the cash we generate and a little bit more than that investing in acquisitions, 1\/3 to buy back stock and 1\/3 to deal with working capital and pay down debt. So I think we, hopefully, will close on acquisitions. We have very good depth in management. We have somewhat of a funnel in the number of deals we can close at any one time, because integration is always limited by human capital, but we remain quite optimistic that over the months to come, we will close on some deals, and I think the Hong Kong and China and Thailand and Johannesburg are more longer-term and less relevant to current earnings. The deals that we would hopefully close on in the not-too-distant future will be more related to earnings a year out or so, and they would be in the developed world. So areas that we're looking at, of course, are the Specialty areas and also Animal Health and Dental. So I'm quite optimistic. But these things are lumpy and they don't close until regulatory has done their work, legal has done theirs, finance has done theirs and human capital is lined from a business point of view.","Operator","The next question will come from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Some of the big picture ones have been answered, so maybe just a little bit more of a specific question. In your Specialty business, I think the Easy implant was rolled out in German at a price of around EUR 99 to EUR 129 roughly 6 months ago. And if you can just talk to what you've seen there post-launch. Do you think it's allowing per share gains? And then your thoughts on bringing that type of an offering to the U.S. in 2014?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I think that's a good question. I'm not sure we expected Easy to help us gain market share in Germany. It's more a placeholder in case the low-price implant will -- emerges. And at this point in time, the low-price implant has grown to some extent in Germany, but not become a material factor. Yes, there are a couple of players that are gaining some market share, but it's really not a major factor from our point of view, because Camlog is not at the high price of the equation. So it's there, we have sold some. We expect to bring it to the States at some point in the future. It's going through a regulatory review at this point. But I don't think we ever implied that the Easy would move the needle in a significant way at Camlog, but it's more in place to deal with a discounting reality, if that is needed in the implant field.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, Steven, maybe some just detailed questions on the model. When we look towards next year, tax rate has come down a bit. So should we shake out closer to 30% or 32% when we look out to '14? Does your '14 EPS number assume that ongoing share repo? And then lastly, the noncontrolling was down q-over-q, is that just a function of you guys consolidating some of that up to the top line?","Steven Paladino","Okay. So on our tax rate, yes, we would be looking for our tax rate to remain in that 30% range. So that's for Q4, but it's also true for 2014. That's what we think is achievable. So I know when I looked at some early sell-side notes, some people thought it was a one-time benefit for the 30%, but we don't believe that's true. We believe that'll stay in that range. With respect to share repurchase, we are expecting to do a small amount of share repurchase. Really what we're expecting is to finish our authorized share repurchase amount of $75-ish million as part of our guidance, but we really don't have more than that built in. We do believe that we will continue with between $200 million and $300 million of share repurchase per year. We expect to talk about that in upcoming board meeting, but at this point we don't have approval for that, although I feel like the board is very positively inclined on the share repurchase program. I'm trying to remember, was there a third piece...","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Last one was the noncontrolling.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, the noncontrolling really, what happened there, we talked about it a quarter or 2 ago. We had a change -- we had an entity in Europe that we did not have a controlling interest. It was included in equity in affiliates and we bought up our interest in that entity. That's really what's showing if you look at the International Dental sales growth. There's some acquisition growth there, that's where it resides. So really, it was -- we don't really -- it's really a move geographically on the P&L, because it was in equity and earnings in affiliate, and now it's a consolidated entity. So we consolidated the whole thing, and the piece of it now comes out of noncontrolling interest.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Cherny with ISI.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So a lot of my questions have been answered. I want to go back to the medical a bit, and maybe, Steve, kind expounding on some of your comments for next year. Obviously a lot of noise surrounding the rollout of ObamaCare. I know that in the past you've talked about not really knowing the specific amount that you may expect going into next year, but as you think about specifically the guidance, does it have any impact related to the expansion of healthcare reform? Any thoughts around coverage? And maybe given where you sit and the amount of physicians you touch, any feedback you're getting as to how they're positioning themselves for whatever current reform may actually work out?","Steven Paladino","Well, that's an obviously very difficult question. The easy part of the answer is, we're really not assuming any significant, or really any benefit in our guidance related to the Affordable Care Act, although we do believe that there'll be more covered lives, somehow, some way. We do believe that it should help patient traffic to our core customer, the physician practice, because it's trying to drive more efficient health care by moving patients out of acute care settings into physician or alternate care settings. But again, there's still so much uncertainty around what's going on there that we didn't feel it was wise to put any of that into our guidance.","Operator","Final question will come from David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just had a quick question. Was there an impact on the medical growth rate due to a switch to or from agency sales? And if so, what was that impact?","Steven Paladino","On the medical side?","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Or in any one of your segments. I know that there had been a change in the way that you reported your growth rate. There was like an agency sales component versus -- there was a change there.","Steven Paladino","So, David, that only occurs in our U.S. Animal Health business. And we did say that the sales growth, normalized for that switch, was 4.8% for the quarter. There is not any similar agency sale concept in any of our other markets, although on the medical side, I think what's important to note is timing of flu vaccine sales, and I think it's important especially when looking at profitability and growth rates in the current quarter. We had about $8 million less flu vaccine sales in Q3 versus Q3 last year. For us, we don't really get concerned over that, because it's purely timing that will reverse in Q4. And as Stanley said, the timing of selling flu vaccines, the peak time is September and October, and this year it just so happened that more was weighted towards October than September. But that's the only kind of normalization adjustment on the medical side.","Stanley M. Bergman","So thank you, everyone. We wanted to end the call on time. We got comments the last time that we went over too long. So thank you for participating.

We're excited with our market share gains and the increase in our operating margin. The cash flow continues to be very good, and strategically, I think we're well-positioned to execute on our strategic plan, which goes through to the end of next year, and we will start shortly with developments of our strategic plan for January 1, 2015 for the 3 years thereafter.

Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. The start of 2018 has been a tremendously busy and really such an exciting time for Henry Schein and our business continues to perform well with solid sales results.","We recently announced two very important transactions that refine our strategic plan to position the company for long-term growth and support the evolution of the business. We expect these actions will build shareholder value for years to come. These are two transformational transactions that we really believe will have lasting impact, positive lasting impact on the company's future.","The first was the announcement on April 3 regarding Henry Schein's dental technology joint venture named Henry Schein One created to deliver integrated dental technology to help the proficient improved practice management and marketing as well as patient communication. This transaction is expected to close later this quarter and we are very excited about the added benefits we can deliver to our customers who seek to build workflow efficiency and bring patients to their practices for treatment generating growth opportunities for our business.","The second important transaction we announced is an agreement to spin off Henry Schein's Animal Health businesses as a separate public company which will then merge with Vets First Choice to create Vets First Corp. This combined company will be a new global leader in animal health. This transaction brings together the power of data analytics, digital communications, practice management software and supply chain expertise into a multi-channel platform.","Vets First Choice will serve as an end-to-end solution to drive improved financial and health outcomes for the over 80,000 animal health practitioners \u2013 practices, shall we say, worldwide, and will offer veterinarians new services and solutions to deliver high quality care to their patients and enhance the economics of their practices. Ultimately, we believe this will help clinicians achieve better outcomes for their pet patients, compete more effectively and improve practice efficiency.","We believe the spin-off and the merger will unlock shareholder value for both Vets First Corp and Henry Schein by positioning each company for above market growth allowing for streamlined focus and enhanced capital allocation. For Vets First Corp, we expect synergies driven largely by accelerated revenues from the adoption of the Vets First Choice platform across the Henry Schein health customer base.","More specifically, Henry Schein Animal Health and Vets First Choice expect synergies to grow annually. So that's in year three, synergies for the combined businesses will be in excess of $100 million in operating income. Of course for Henry Schein, this transaction will enable us to drive new opportunities for growth as we increase our focus on helping dentists, dental laboratories, and physicians operate more efficient practices, so practitioners can deliver quality clinical care and advanced wellness and prevention.","We will continue to provide innovative solutions through our high touch value added solutions model for our Dental and Medical customers across the globe. The correlation between good oral care and good health care in general lends itself to the focus on both our Dental and Medical customer bases as we advance a one-Schein strategy across the entire human spectrum of health care.","In line with this, we expect to deliver EPS growth for the remaining consolidated business once the transaction closes later in the year and we expect this to be in the high-single digit to low-double digit range. We are excited about the significant opportunities Henry Schein's Dental and Medical businesses will generate as we implement our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan.","Building upon our long history of successful reinvention, the company will continue to expand our offering of innovative solutions for our Dental and Medical customers. Really very, very exciting times. These two transformational transactions one, helping to advance Henry Schein Dental and Medical strategy, and the other to advance our Animal Health strategy in a spin-off company that will merge with a leading solutions company to create really exciting opportunities for the Animal Health business as well.","So I'll now hand the call over to Steven to review our financial results, and then I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. So Steven, please.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As I begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q1 2018 non-GAAP results exclude restructuring costs as well as specific transaction cost related to our recently announced Animal Health spin off and merger with Vets First Choice.","We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.","These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation in Exhibit B that was issued in this morning's earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Turning now to our results. Net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $3.2 billion, reflecting a 10.2% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017. Internally generated sales growth in local currencies was 3.8%. When also excluding the impact of certain products shifting between agency sales and direct sales, our normalized sales growth was 4.9%. You could also note the sales growth details that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release.","Our operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 6.4% contracted by 23 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2017. And that reflects a few different factors. The first relates to the inclusion of restructuring costs as well as the transaction costs related to the spin-off of our Animal Health business. These two items combined negatively impacted our operating margin by 23 basis points.","The second relates to the impact of the previously announced one-time cash bonus for certain designated staff members which negatively impacted our operating margin by 10 basis points. Third, acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and the related expenses as well as the impact of sales switching between agency and direct sales combined to negatively impact the operating margin by 8 basis points.","If you want to exclude the net impact of these three items, our operating margin expanded by approximately 18 basis points on a year-over-year basis. I'm pleased to note that we reported lower year-over-year expenses as a percentage of sales as we continue to realize operating efficiencies from restructuring efforts. We will continue our commitment to improve efficiencies across the businesses that we expect will drive long-term earnings growth.","If you look at our reported GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018, it was 24.7% which compares to 20.7% in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was due to the lower benefit from stock-based compensation related to ASU 2016-09 as we mentioned would be the case during our Q4 earnings call. We believe our full year tax rate will be in the 24% range going forward.","Moving on, net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. was $140.2 million or $0.91 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, representing a decline of 0.4% and an increase of 3.4%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017.","Note that these results include the impact of approximately $0.02 related to the one-time cash bonus for certain designated staff members.","Excluding the restructuring and transaction costs related to the spinoff and merger of Animal Health, adjusted non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the first quarter of 2018 was $145.9 million or $0.95 per diluted share. This represents growth of 3.6% and 8.0%, respectively, compared with the first quarter of 2017.","I'd like to provide some additional color on our results. Amortization from acquired intangible assets was $31.3 million pre-tax or $0.15 per diluted share for Q1 2018. Also, foreign currency exchange had a positive impact on diluted EPS for the quarter of approximately $0.03.","Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. I would note that the timing of Good Friday in Q1 resulted in one less selling day in several major countries internationally. I'll discuss that change in more detail in a moment. It's important to note that last year Good Friday was in Q2, so this is a timing impact which will reverse next quarter.","Our Dental sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased 10.2% to $1.5 billion, with internal growth in local currencies of 2.9%. North American internal growth in local currencies was 3.1% and included 2.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. The impact on dental consumable merchandise sales growth related to Good Friday was relatively immaterial at approximately 15 basis points for the quarter.","Our North American dental equipment sales and service internal revenue grew by 4.4% in local currencies and that follows a strong result in the fourth quarter of 2017 when we reported sales growth of 18.1%.","International Dental internal growth in local currencies was 2.6% and included 2.4% growth in dental consumable merchandise. The impact from the timing of Good Friday on international dental consumable merchandise sales growth was approximately 1%. Also, our growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue was 3.1%.","Animal Health sales were $919.8 million for the first quarter, an increase of 13.1% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 3.6%. The 3.6% internal growth in local currencies included 3.7% growth in North America. However, when normalizing for the impact of a manufacturer switching from direct to an agency sales agreement, sales growth was a robust 11.6%. We believe this double-digit normalized sales growth for the quarter reflects a healthy end market and our commitment to offering a wide range of products and value-added solutions.","International Animal Health sales growth in local currencies was 3.4% and was also negatively impacted by approximately 1% due to the timing of Good Friday. I would note that the growth of 3.4% was also against a tough comparison last year where we reported internal sales growth of 8.9%.","Our Medical sales were $640.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 6.9% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 6.4%. The 6.4% included 6.7% growth in North America and a 3.1% decline internationally. We are very pleased with our overall Medical sales results, which again was primarily driven by solid organic growth from existing large customers. Organic growth also benefited from increased patient traffic due to a strong flu season.","If we look at Technology and Value-Added sales, they were $112.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 6.1% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 2.9%. In North America, Technology and Value-Added Services had internal sales growth of 1.7% in local currencies, or 2.2%, when normalized for certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales. Growth was primarily impacted by lower unit sales in the quarter.","In international markets, local internal sales growth of 9.3% was strong across the board highlighted by double-digit growth in both financial services and veterinary software revenue.","I'd like to mention that our stock repurchase program, we did not purchase any common stock in Q1 as a result of a blackout period related to the spin-off and merger of our Animal Health business. I'd also like to point out that we are still committed to a balanced capital allocation approach to building shareholder value including stock repurchases which we expect to resume during the year. At the close of the quarter, we had about $200 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock.","Looking at some highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, the operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $70.9 million, which compares to negative $52.6 million in the first quarter of last year. It's important to note that our first quarter cash flow is typically negative due to seasonality in working capital during the quarter. We continue to believe we will have strong operating cash flow for the year.","We expect that the capital from the spin-off and merger, when available later this year, will be between $1 billion and $1.25 billion in cash on a tax-free basis and will be used for general corporate purposes including share repurchases, paying down debt and M&A activities. Note also that as part of the spin-off and merger transaction and prior to its completion, we expect to buy out the minority interest in our U.S. Animal Health business for approximately $365 million.","Turning to the restructuring, during last quarter's earnings call, we noted that we plan to undertake a restructuring effort in 2018. We have begun some initial activities which are reflected in our first quarter results. However, we are still in the planning phase and therefore, we expect to provide more specific information on the magnitude of this restructuring program later this year.","At a high level we are looking at opportunities to augment our technology solutions to generate innovative customer solutions and services as well as improved efficiencies across the business, particularly with redundant activities resulting from prior acquisition activity. We may consolidate certain warehouses where there is an overlap; however, there's a great deal of analysis that is required before we can provide specific details on the estimated cost as well as the estimated benefits related to the restructuring.","Periodically we look to reduce cost particularly following a number of acquisitions as in the past, and accomplishing this through a coordinated effort is the most efficient means to realize cost optimization.","I'll conclude my remarks by noting that excluding costs related to restructuring and spin-off and merger of the Henry Schein Animal Health business, today we are affirming our prior 2018 diluted EPS guidance. At the same time, we are not able to provide estimates for the impact of the restructuring costs or spin-off and merger costs on a full year 2018 basis.","So diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein Inc. is expected to be $4.03 to $4.14 for 2018. That is reflecting a growth of 12% to 15% on a non-GAAP basis compared with the 2017 non-GAAP basis of diluted EPS of $3.60.","Our guidance includes the impact of approximately $0.02 related to the previously announced onetime cash bonus for certain designated staff members, but does exclude the cost related to restructuring as well as the spin-off and merger costs related to our Henry Schein Animal Health business.","Our guidance assumes that end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions. And guidance for 2018 is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions.","We also would expect to update our full year guidance for the remaining business once the spin-off and merger of the Animal Health business closes. This guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are consistent with current levels.","Lastly, we believe there are no material impacts to our 2018 results due to the new revenue and sales pronouncement and the adoption of ASU 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers.","With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Steven. Let's review some business highlights for the first quarter 2018. We are most pleased with the financial results for the quarter and actually in all of our business units.","Our track record of delivering solid organic sales growth demonstrates not only healthy end markets, but also our ability to execute on our goal of continued gains in market share across the board and in all of our businesses. In fact, on a normalized basis, our quarterly organic growth rate has ranged from 4% to 6% for the past three years. We believe this execution is directly tied in to our high touch value added solutions business model.","In our Dental business, North American dental consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies continue to be solid up 2.7% year-over-year. Keep in mind this growth was negatively impacted by approximately 15 basis points due to the timing of Good Friday.","The end market has been relatively stable now for almost two years with no material deterioration that we can detect. Henry Schein has done well and continued to gain market share.","As mentioned, our international dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 2.4% was negatively impacted by approximately 1%, 100 basis point due to the timing of Good Friday. While our current guidance assumes stable end market conditions, we are optimistic that favorable macroeconomic factors including low unemployment and solid consumer confidence will lead to improving unit growth over time in North America. Ensuring that we are well positioned to take advantage of this anticipated growth is key, and we believe we have the right strategy and the right set of products, solutions, support, and actually the right priorities to continue to execute on our plans to grow our market share and accordingly, our profits.","We reported solid dental equipment internal growth in local currencies of 4.4%. As Steven mentioned in the fourth quarter of 2017, we had strong sales growth in dental equipment of over 18%. We reiterate that that's the 18% that in our last conference call could not be assumed to continue at that rate. Having said that, we believe that our 4.4% growth was quite solid for the first quarter.","We believe the equipment market in North America is healthy and we expect dentists to continue to invest in their best practices turning to Henry Schein for a wide range of solutions from our broad manufacturing partners. This is particularly true as practices increasingly look to us to help them adopt technology aimed at driving workflow efficiencies so that, of course, in the end they can see more patients. More efficiency in the practice results and lower cost, but also, more importantly, better quality of care.","And so the whole technological movement in workflow in the dental marketplace is an area we've been focusing on for several years now and is helping us continue to grow nicely as we gain market share. Of course also, these are fast growing categories. Our new relationship with Dentsply Sirona in the U.S. continues to be positive, but also, let me remind investors we also had solid sales with several of our other dental equipment suppliers.","In quarter one, we recorded mid-single-digit growth in traditional equipment sales and double digit growth in sales and CAD\/CAM solutions. So two of the three major categories did well for us in the first quarter and that was on the heels of a really tremendous fourth quarter of 2017.","Let's turn to Europe for a minute. Regarding Europe and Germany in particular, we believe pricing transparency pressures have stabilized. We expect to continue to enhance the Value-Added Solutions we operate in overseas markets, which help to create closer relationships, more bonded relationships between Henry Schein and our customers.","Keep in mind that not all Value-Added Solutions can be rolled out in Europe immediately. In fact, we have many of these value-added services firmly embedded in most parts of Europe, but our goal in Germany is to continue to advance, in particular, Germany, our Value-Added Solutions. Some of these require investment and careful planning and may take several quarters, and in some cases a year or two to fully implement.","That said, we expect to make continual progress in our introduction of these services. We have a well established proven model for our Value-Added Solutions platform, so we know what the customers require and how to build out this portfolio of solutions. So very, very pleased with the performance in North America and in the international businesses. And particularly I think we showed good results in sales in Europe and believe that we will continue to do well in the European markets.","Before we move on to Animal Health, I would like to draw your attention to an important announcement we made at the American Association of Orthodontists meeting this past week where we introduced our new SLX Clear Aligner solution entering the rapidly growing market for orthodontic aligners.","Our Sagittal First\/Motion 3D system uses a unique combination approach. It addresses bite correction first with a Motion 3D system before aligners are introduced to the treatment process. As a result, we expect that the patient will require fewer number of aligners than if using an existing solution. The SLX system can also be used as a standalone Clear Aligner solution.","The SLX system is competitively priced and we believe it will offer significant workflow efficiencies that will save time for both clinicians and patients. Our product will cover the full range of minor, moderate and comprehensive treatment. We're very, very excited to add this important solution to our portfolio of dental specialty solutions, and I'm very, very pleased to report we received a terrific reception at the Association of American Orthodontists meeting this past week \u2013 weekend actually.","The SLX system really is very, very exciting for Henry Schein as it rounds out our orthodontic product offering which in turn rounds out our dental specialty solutions where we're doing well with oral surgery in the implants, bone regeneration space, the endodontic area and now with a full range of orthodontic products.","So let's talk about Animal Health. As Steven mentioned, Animal Health internal growth in North America reflects a manufactured change for direct sales to an agency basis. On a normalized basis, we have delivered double-digit internal growth, extremely pleased with the progress our Animal Health team has made in North America this past quarter. We're excited about the opportunities for our Animal Health business where we combine it with Vets First Choice as a pure play independent company once, of course, this transaction closes later this year.","Again, international Animal Health sales grew about 3.4%, negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points, 1%, due to the timing of Good Friday. Our North American Medical business delivered solid sales in the quarter of internal growth in particular. There were no acquisitions so it's all internal growth in local currencies. And it was in the high-single digit region, range reflecting increased patient traffic to our physician office customers and our execution on serving large group practices.","We are recognized and awarded for meeting the needs of the large group enterprises through our strong supply chain and management capabilities while remaining committed to our end customer, the general practitioner, providing the products and support they need to deliver quality clinical care.","So in our Technology and Value-Added Services business, we're excited about the opportunities both in North America and potentially, over time, in our international markets with our Henry Schein One platform of solutions. And I'll remind you, the transaction hasn't closed yet, but the opportunities are terrific.","We expect to significantly enhance our Value-Added Solutions portfolio of products as we build upon our technical integration capabilities to deliver a new platform of enhance dental software and services that work seamlessly together to share data and streamline digital workflow.","With that in mind, operator, we're ready to address any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning guys. Can you hear me okay?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes we can.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right great. So Stanley, I know you mentioned kind of dental end markets in your prepared comments, but I'd love to hear kind of just overall thoughts on how market has progressed maybe over the last six to nine months or so and how you see it playing out over the balance of this year, especially in North America.","But Steve, I also have a question on the Heartland headwind from the last four quarters. In the first quarter last year it was smaller than the other three quarters. So I'm wondering if there was any timing issues where some of those headwinds might have bled over into the first quarter of this year, or is that 2.7% number a clean number, at least from a Heartland perspective?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","So Jeff, on the market growth, I think we're still of the view that the market is stable, leaning positive with \u2013 on consumables, but that there's good traction on the specialty side.","We think the implant market is growing much faster. And we are very pleased now to enter the fastest growing part of the orthodontic business, the aligner area. We have a pretty unique offering there. A combo product or a product that could be purchased just as an aligner. And the endodontic business continues \u2013 that market continues to grow also at a bit of a faster rate.","So you take the consumable market basically stable, leaning positive with specialty growing and of course the equipment market, both in the U.S. in North America and Europe is growing very, very nicely as we advance digitalization into the dentists' office.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah, and I'll just comment on the second part of your question, Jeff. Yes, there was a little bit of negative impact related to Heartland in Q1 but it was immaterial. It was less than 10 basis points.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right that's helpful. Thank you. And I guess for my follow-up, just wondering on the equipment side, I know on the DEXIS practice management software, you're working to kind of integrate some new intraoral opportunities there. When do you expect that to be complete and ready to go? And does that at all have an impact then on how we should think about your equipment growth in the back half of this year? Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","I don't think this will have a material impact. I think the integration will occur in the months ahead. But, I do not believe that that will have a significant impact.","We are integrating so many different equipment systems into the Henry Schein practice management electronic, medical records system. And there's \u2013 opportunities abound all over; not only with DEXIS and Danaher but also with of course Sirona, Dentsply Sirona where things are going well on the integration side. And I might add with Planmeca as well and, of course, 3shape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for the questions. Stanley, there's been a lot of focus on equipment just given all the moving pieces in the market. Your North American equipment number was quite a bit lower than we saw last quarter and fell a little bit short of what we were thinking. I know you offered some comments in your prepared remarks of what performed well within the quarter in your mind. But I was hoping maybe you could just delve a little bit deeper into the North American equipment number for the quarter. And maybe specifically, how did the Sirona portfolio contribute relative to your expectations?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes. So, we actually thought we did better than expectations because we had a 18% growth rate in the fourth quarter which was \u2013 it's massive. And in the call, last quarter call for the fourth quarter of 2017 did caution that that kind of expectation cannot continue maybe periodically. And we thought we moderated expectations. So I think we did quite well. On the traditional equipment, we did very well. In fact, I think, our growth was around 6%; on CAD\/CAM was about 20%. But on the digital products, where we really sold a lot of digital imaging, we didn't have such a great quarter. But if you take into account the volume that we sold in the fourth quarter of last year, you will understand it.","So as we usually comment whenever anybody asks about equipment, I don't think you can look at any one equipment quarter and make any conclusions. I think you have to look at an annual. At least put together a few quarters and you can project. But we are very pleased with our equipment growth in the U.S. and I believe our pipeline is looking pretty good. And we're working very well with our manufacturer community. It's a very, very exciting time for Henry Schein in the equipment field, specifically as we go back to Jeff's previous question, as we integrate our digital equipment, our CAD\/CAM equipment with our practice management, electronic records system. And I believe that when we look at the opportunities that Henry Schein One will present given our merger with Internet Brands on the Dental side, the equipment market looks very, very exciting.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. No, I appreciate that Stanley. And I guess, Steve, just a quick follow-up. You've discussed having a goal of improving inventory turns. But again this quarter we did see inventory build. Can you maybe just help us understand the dynamics at play on the inventory side? Is this still Sirona related or is it something different than that?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well, it's a combination. A little bit of Dentsply Sirona related, but we are working through that inventory which we should do later this year. But there was also opportunities for forward buy-ins that we took advantage of. So we still believe that the goal of reducing inventory and increasing inventory turns is achievable. We are working on it. But if there's opportunities that have a good return on investment and we have to grow the inventory a little bit from time to time, we'll also take advantage of that.","Just want to back up on the first question just to add some color. Our equipment backlog also grew from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. So I think that's helpful in understanding that the pipeline is still strong on equipment.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Stan, given last week's announcements in the Clear Aligner space and the extra capital you'll have after the Animal Health spend, has your thinking changed at all about wanting to own brands? And should we think about that as becoming a larger part of the strategy going forward?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Good question, John. Yes, I think in specialty areas we will continue to grow our own brand. In areas where we feel we can't get necessarily the full support that we need, we will continue to advance our brands. But let me assure you that Henry Schein is a national brand company and we will remain totally focused on national brands where we can obtain adequate support. Sometimes we can't get the support we need specifically in the areas of competitive, for example, DSO space, where we promote our Henry Schein brand and related control brands.","But at the end of the day, we are very committed to advancing our specialty businesses throughout the world. We have a relatively small market share. These businesses, the ones we own have done very, very well for us. We have great management in the oral surgery space, the orthodontic space, the endodontic space, of course, related to prosthodontists. And we \u2013 as well, you can add that in as part of the orthodontics \u2013 as part of the oral surgery space.","We are very, very excited of what we can do there, of course not only in the implants in the various sectors of the implants; the more higher priced premium brands, the mid brands, the lower price, the clone type areas we were focused on that. Bone regeneration has done very well for us.","The products bought around the specialist has been very important. So, yes, we are committed to advancing our own brands in the specialty area in particular. But also where we cannot get the support we need to be competitive, we will do what we need to do. But I think the national brands will support us. These suppliers, the CEOs of these companies have provided us with confidence that we will remain competitive in every market and in all classes of trade. And so \u2013 but in the specialty area, it's an area that we will continue to invest in manufacturing and go directly to the source if need be for our own control brands. And then the private brand is an area we will compete with heavily on our own \u2013 through our own private brand if we can't gain the market support that we need.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And maybe one just quick follow-up. Can you give us an update on the corporate account business across your three key categories? And should we be thinking of that as a headwind or a tailwind for bottom-line growth in the coming year?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","No, I think it's a positive contributor to our growth. We continue to grow our market share in Dental on the large accounts, the mid-size accounts, and, of course, the small ones. But, I think, we're working very well in that space, both on the consumable equipment side, but also on the practice management software side where I think our cloud-based system, Ascend, is very, very competitive, not only in the U.S. but globally. And so the whole space I think is a great opportunity for us to grow sales.","And yes margins. We will of course continue to drive efficiencies. Part of the restructuring is to drive that. But also, I believe our own brands will help us and we are now seeing a lot more support from the manufacturers in ensuring that we remain competitive. So I'm not saying they won't do it with others, but our market position is good. We're investing in technology to help these customers. And I would say it's a real good opportunity for growth going forward.","Again, both the very large accounts and the mid-size accounts and that's in \u2013 by the way of course in Dental. But it's a significant part of our growth in Medical now for years where our brand is becoming more and more associated with the ability to provide excellent supply chain and value-added services for these large group practices, for IDNs and also in the Animal Health space where we are by far the leader and continue to grow. So yes, this is all good business for us. And we of course always have to be more efficient. And at the same time, we got to make sure we add the right products and gain the right support.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about any pricing pressure that you may be seeing in North America (44:54) DSOs or the online vendors? And it seems like you overcame that this quarter. Like, maybe just talk a bit about that dynamic if you can please. Thank you.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for that question. First of all, I don't remember, and I've said this in the past, a year where we haven't had pricing pressure at Henry Schein. Yes, we have pricing pressure; always had. I would say little bit more with the smaller accounts. But because of course there's more transparency on pricing, dentists compare prices between each other and study clubs, et cetera. But I remain very optimistic and we are showing good results because we are getting support from manufacturers of branded products. And indeed, our private brand is extremely competitive. So we don't lose so much business over price.","As it relates to the IDNs, there is, of course, a focus as professionals run, especially large IDNs, and we need to ensure that we get the appropriate support from our branded manufacturers and when that's not available, our private brand, our corporate brand which is very, very good. So I think you take that plus a growing appreciation of the value-added services we provide, and we do have unique services in that market. We didn't develop the software only for Dental, the support software. But it's software that we use in our Medical business as well. And so we have unique capabilities.","And I think we're being \u2013 those capabilities are appreciated. But we're constantly under price pressure and have been for decades and we need to ensure that we become more and more efficient. Of course, years ago, we would be happy to take orders manually from a corporate account. Today, we expect that all to be received by computer. So, we've made lots of strides in the digitalization of those accounts and we will continue to increase efficiency through various forms of system improvement amongst these large accounts.","And these businesses are now growing to being led on the purchasing side by supply chain people who appreciate our capabilities. But if you take all of that and you wrap it around our practice management software capabilities, we remain very, very optimistic about this marketplace and we'll continue to invest in it.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","All right. And then just one quick follow-up. Did I hear you correctly, the CAD\/CAM growth rate in the quarter was 20%?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. One of the things I was wondering about was the new tech JV. I know you stated that you're thinking that has about $400 million in revenues, but how \u2013 can you help us think about how much of that is sort of incremental versus the contributions from revenues that you guys already have?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. Let maybe Steven should answer that. Go ahead, Steven. Sorry.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Elizabeth, of the $400 million, approximately $300 million was our existing business and approximately $100 million will be incremental revenue because of the joint venture with Internet Brands. And we will report the additional $100 million as acquisition revenue going forward when the deal closes. Again the deal is expected to close end of June, maybe early July, in that timeframe.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's really helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Stan, just wanted to go back to the Medical business, solid growth relative to our expectations. I guess first off, did flu contribute much to the volume and the growth you saw there? And I guess what sorts of other trends outside of the IDN pressure you're seeing can you call out?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. Steven may have specifics on exactly the impact of flu. Obviously it did have an impact. I would say some on the flu vaccine but also on the tests. But there are always puts and takes in this business. I'm not sure if flu drove it significantly. We are just gaining market share in this space because of our capabilities to service IDNs, and IDNs are of course, owning practices outside of the four walls of the hospital. But I would say even in the hospital where they have separate sections for ambulatory care, we are doing quite well in that space.","But then there's these group practices, many of them multi-specialty group practices, that are not necessarily owned by IDNs but they have to compete with IDN owned practices. And generally our supply chain capabilities are very, very good; unique in that space. And we give them the reports they need. We give them the service they need and the capabilities of searching the appropriate GPO contract to use. Our private brand is highly competitive in the space. So I would say generally the business has been solid for several years now and we're very enthusiastic about this business.","There are obviously parts of that business where we are uniquely capable and that's where you have a practice, specifically a specialty practice that uses a lot of consumables, and that's where we do very, very well. The dermatologists and the aesthetics surgeons and those \u2013 and of course the internists, and so we are growing very well in certain categories. But actually the direct impact of flu was there, but I'm not sure how material it was. Steven?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah, yes. Yeah, flu was not a significant contributor at all. And we sell the bulk of our flu vaccine in Q3 and Q4. We sold less than $2 million of flu vaccine this year. It's up slightly over last year but still very insignificant as it impacts our growth.","We did have strong growth across the board though in both med-surg products, diagnostic products, equipment, pharma. So really it wasn't related to flu. It was related to all of the other products that we typically sell.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Got you. And then Steve, one quick one for you too. In Animal Health I know it's less of an interest now since you're spinning it out. But the buy sell, the agency switch it seems like that's something that's affected you guys every quarter. When are we going to see that annualize?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well, this latest change just started either late Q4 or at the beginning of Q1. So that won't annualize until the year end of 2018. But there were some new changes that just recently occurred that's driving it now.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thank you.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. First one, just certainly solid progress in a short period of time with the international consumables. You mentioned your value added services already taking hold. Maybe if you can talk about those initiatives. And do you already feel in a better competitive position going forward when we think about insulating yourself from some of the pricing pressure that you guys alluded to in the past? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. So it was a very specific issue in one quarter. First of all the value added services are doing well but in Germany, we do not have practice management. And in Germany I would say our team focuses heavily on equipment. And so it was not focused so much on consumables.","But I think in the last four, five months \u2013 so I'll say Europe has been fine; Australia, New Zealand with the value-added services. And we have now \u2013 focusing the German team more on consumables and I think that is kicking in and working quite well. So I think there's quite a bit of stability there in our European business.","We're also in one particular quarter, the one where there was so much discussion on this, there was almost a perfect storm. We had this challenge in Germany because we're heavily, heavily focused in equipment in that quarter.","Last year was a heavy equipment year in general in Germany. IDS fourth quarter. So \u2013 and then we had an anomaly in France. But overall I would say our international business is quite stable and the German matter that we experienced the past couple of quarters I would say is resolved, but the team is really focused on growing consumables. In addition, of course, to continuing with our terrific brand and market share in equipment.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And just a follow-up would be in equipment. Certainly the 20% CAD\/CAM number is solid, but that is with X-ray in North America versus not there a year ago. So if you can elaborate, Stanley, on the demand for DI only. We've seen it in our checks for some time, quite honestly, and seems like it continues to pick up momentum in North America. Curious your thoughts and also if you're seeing that play out in the international markets as well. Thanks for your time, guys.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. I don't have in front of me, maybe Steven does, specifics on DI growth. But I think that's \u2013 DI continues to do well in the U.S. and globally. But I think in the U.S., clearly we're selling more complete systems. And our strategy still is, by the way, to go into dentists that are not ready to invest in a full system and explain to them the value of at least having a scanner, as it is more efficient, clinically better. It's much more pleasant for the patient. And I think we'll continue to focus on that.","I don't have the specifics on the quarter per se, but the scanner \u2013 the move towards scanner is growing globally. And I think our suppliers are understanding this and they're understanding that yes, the full system can be very, very important. But there's also a market for the scanners. And this philosophy is I think a global phenomenon. So I don't \u2013 and maybe, Steven, you have specifics.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah, I can give some color on that. So the digital impressioning scanner did grow year-over-year but the real accelerated growth did come from new CAD\/CAM unit sales, complete systems. And that was really the big driver of the 20% number that Stanley quoted.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Stan and Steve. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on some of the inventory destocking. Obviously a few different manufacturers were talking about that having some impact on their 1Q results. And I guess just based on your inventory numbers, I guess, I'm just curious to your thoughts whether you think that this is maybe happening away from Henry Schein and maybe it's just more prevalent at other distributors. Or maybe you're looking at it \u2013 I mean, again, I'm not asking you to talk about any individual companies obviously, but could you look at it and say, yes, it makes sense to us that manufacturer X is saying they're seeing destocking. Then maybe you're taking down one manufacturer and not another. But just curious to get your just more general high level thoughts around this because it seems like it is \u2013 we keep hearing about this from the large dental manufacturers about destocking. Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Maybe, Steven, you can give specifics on destocking.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes. So it's so hard for us to give you exact details because even within manufacturers, there's certain product lines that we could be more or less efficient on. We don't drive the entire market, obviously. So we try to stay away from commenting on specific manufacturers on what's going on with destocking. So, I don't really have specifics, Steve, to be honest with you because we don't look at our inventory levels by that. We look at product categories rather than by manufacturer. And I really can't provide more commentary on what the manufacturers are saying. I assume it to be true, but I can't really tell you from our vantage point.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's fair. Can I sneak in one other quick one just on \u2013 you mentioned some market share gains in Dental as part of your growth in 1Q 2018. That's obviously positive. Just curious if you think you're primarily capitalizing on various let's call it disruption situations in the marketplace, perhaps at other dental distributors. Or are you winning maybe now for other reasons? Just curious on what you think is happening on your share gains within Dental. Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Steven?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes. So, look, the market is growing somewhere slightly north of 1% on consumables in North America. We did almost triple that, 2.5 times that. Look, it can't hurt that we are seeing some other competitors having some disruption, but we don't think that's a big part of it. We think really our growth is coming from continuing to take the approach of being that high value, high touch with a lot of value-added solutions. As you know, we did not really hire a significant amount of competitive reps, although we did hire some. So I think it's really our model. And we don't think it's coming from any one particular competitor. We think it's really coming from the overall market.","Operator","We have time for one last question coming from the line of Stephen Hagan of RBC.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just kind of going back to the shift in Animal Health from direct to agency sales, there's a very substantial move this quarter. Can you talk about what drove this change, and any overall trends you're seeing for direct versus agency sales?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes. I will just answer the last part of your question and say we don't see a movement to direct sales. Our suppliers are all telling us that they wish to continue to do business with us. They're very excited about the merger between Vets First Choice and Henry Schein Animal Health. Uniformly I might add that without exception. But the demand (01:01:06), maybe Steven, you can address.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure. Talked about this a little bit on an earlier question. We have seen one significant manufacturer that has gone from traditional sales to agency sales. It's BI, Boehringer, that made that switch. It's something that we can't control, quite frankly. It's for the whole industry. That's the way they announced it at the beginning of this year or late last year. For us from a profitability point of view, it doesn't make a significant difference on whether it's agency or not. We do prefer non-agency because we really like to also be closer to our customer. But this is what it is, so we're happy to continue to sell them through an agency basis.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just a quick follow-up. The purchase of the non-controlling interest this quarter, was that related to the Animal Health spin-off? Or was that for a separate change?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well, first of all, it didn't happen yet. We expect it to happen probably in Q2. I would say it's indirectly related to the spin-off. I don't know if it's completely directly related, but it is somewhat related. Either way for us, we feel good about completing the purchase. We had a good relationship with the partner for many, many years. And I think we both created tremendous value. And now that that chapter is ending, we're still comfortable going forward and spinning off our Animal Health business. It'll be helpful to Vets First Corp because when you're doing integrations, it's a little bit more difficult when you have minority partners. Not that it can't be done, but it's a little bit more difficult. So I think it's helpful to the new spin co that that no longer will be a minority shareholder.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thank you.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes. So, thank you. Sorry. Operator?","Operator","Now back to (01:03:21) for closing remarks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your interest. Looking back at where we've come in the last year or two and where we're heading, it does takes me back really to the general philosophy of Henry Schein. I wasn't there at the founding, but over the past eight decades Henry Schein has been in a state of reinvention as we consistently challenge ourselves to, at the end of the day, better service our customers and remain extremely relevant. And, of course, we're very close to our customers, understand their needs. Bringing our customers value-added solutions and helping them thrive is the cornerstone of our success.","And of course, if they thrive, they'll thrive for two reasons. One is they're running a more efficient business and at the same time, providing great quality of care. Sometimes this reinvention involves small incremental changes. And at other times, it involves significant changes to our business. The formation of Henry Schein One and the spin-off and merger of our Animal Health business both fall in the latter category. These are significant moves and will really position us very well in Dental.","And in combination with Medical, because there's a growing connection between the two and we really think we're well positioned there to continue to grow. While independently, the Animal Health businesses, the Henry Schein and the Vets First Choice animal business will do very well. The connection between the two is not as relevant today as it was years ago when essentially it was \u2013 the Animal Health business was a supply chain business. But it's growing to become a service business, phenomenal installed base of practice management systems, both in North America and abroad. Vets First Choice has a solution that if you combine it with our platform is unique. Of course, data is critical and we believe we will be able to help manufacturers obtain compliance with veterinarian prescriptions issued.","So you put those two together, the software and the Vets First Choice, you have a very powerful combination. And you combine that with the supply chain, either selling to the veterinarian or fulfilling on behalf of the veterinarian and you have the world's most unique supply chain, software, value-added services business. What these two transactions have in common is increasingly important. The role of technology with our customers. Our customers are in the digital era like all of us. And it's technology that is the biggest question on their mind. What technology should they use and how should they use it? And we are now ideally \u2013 we've always been positioned through our software businesses of helping, but we're now in a very, very unique position.","For years, advances in technology were largely manifested in the equipment and software products we sold. But today, not only in Animal Health, but of course in Dental integrated technology is critical to practice operations. I might add in the Medical world too, including how customers attract and retain patients. How they communicate to their patients and manage their online reputation. This is all the stuff that we are focused on, both in Dental and in Animal Health and to some extent on the Medical side. It is also supporting patient compliance.","Again, Dental and Animal Health which will have this enormous impact on health care outcomes. And if we can impact that, as we are sure we will, it'll be good for our business. And better outcomes validates our commitment to be a health care solutions network and powered by our people and technology.","So we told you about our 2018, 2019 and 2020 strategic plan which we believe will be, in the end, as successful as the preceding three year strategic plans which have been very successful for decades. And we believe the Henry Schein intellectual capital will continue to be providing creative solutions for our customers to succeed in generating income for their practice while providing quality of care. And we believe we're well positioned to continue to add and increase shareholder value.","So very, very pleased with \u2013 of course, the last strategic plan, the three years, ending in 2017, the first quarter of 2018 and the down payments we've made in executing our 2018, 2019 and 2020 strategic plan which I think will once again transform the company and advance our solutions capabilities to our customers while increasing shareholder value.","So thank you for joining us today. Again, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact Carolynne Borders at Investor Relations, 631-390-8105. 631-390-8105. And I look forward to speaking again at the end of the second quarter with our results and that will take place in August.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, Tiffany, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2018 fourth quarter and full year. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking.

Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. [Operator Instructions].","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 2018 has been a historic and extremely busy year at Henry Schein as we further position the company to advance our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan. First, we announced the spin-off of our global Animal Health business, which is now complete. We believe that Covetrus represents a significant global technology-enabled provider of products and services for the companion animal health market. We expect customers as well as suppliers will benefit from the technology, practice management software and insights offered by Covetrus to help drive better clinical outcomes for pets patients. ","This past year, we also announced the formation of Henry Schein One, which advances practice efficiency and clinical effectiveness while carrying our dental practice management software with the new demand generation tools to help customers better communicate with patients and to drive increase traffic into the dental practice. This joint venture will not only, of course, be a way to advance our general sales with our dental customers but will provide organic growth and a terrific platform for inorganic and acquisition bolt-ons to make this business even more effective over the years to come. It's really quite profitable and expected to be even more profitable. ","Last, we began restructuring efforts, which Steven will discuss in further detail and which required a great deal of focus for most of the year and in particular, the last 6 months of the year. Together, these efforts are strategically positioning Henry Schein for continued success, and I want to offer special thanks to our Team Schein Members across the globe for the significant contributions to these important efforts. ","Let me add, although challenges in implementing all 3 of these initiatives, generally, the morale in the company is very good, and generally, these programs have been successfully implemented. The work involved in the spin-off was significant, likewise with Henry Schein One and also the restructuring program. As we begin the new year, we are most excited about the future of Henry Schein. We believe the long-term business opportunities remain attractive in the Global Dental and Medical office market as well as the ultimate care sites. This is where we're focused. We're focused on wellness and prevention, and we believe this is where health care needs to be heading and is indeed heading. And we believe we're in a very good start to continue to advance shareholder value. ","We also believe our long-standing strategy of organic and acquisition growth will enable us to continue to build upon our market share positions over time as we offer the broadest range of solutions in the markets we serve, including Medical and dental supply chain and specialty product and services solutions as well as dental technology through, of course, Henry Schein One. ","At this time, I'll ask Steven to review our financial results and guidance. And then I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. Steven, please.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results on an as-reported basis and GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q4 2018 and Q4 2017 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. For a detailed reconciliation, see Exhibit B in this morning's earnings release. Also, to facilitate comparisons against past results, we are providing unaudited financial information for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and for each quarter of 2018 on a continuing operations basis, so excluding the Animal Health business. This can be found on exhibit C and D of today's press release. ","If you turn to our results for the quarter, net sales for the quarter ended December 29, 2018, were $3.4 billion, reflecting a 1.7% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 2.1%. When also excluding the impact of certain products switching from direct sales to agency sales, our normalized internal sales growth in local currencies was 2.6%. You can see the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of today's earnings news release. ","On a GAAP basis, operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 5.3% and contracted by 195 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. However, on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the restructuring costs, transaction costs related to the Animal Health spin-off, our operating margin was only down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Full year 2018, excluding the same factors as noted above as well as certain onetime litigation expenses in both periods, our operating margin was down 17 basis points compared to 2017. Again, you can see a reconciliation with GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income in the supplemental info page on the Investor Relations page of our website. As we have previously mentioned, we are focused on increasing sales of higher-margin products and services to drive gross margin improvements across all of our businesses and the continuing effort to reduce cost as part of our restructuring initiatives. ","Turning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 19.2%. This compares to a GAAP effective tax rate of 19.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, on a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 23.5% and compares with the prior year non-GAAP tax rate of 27.7%. On a full year basis, the effective tax rate was 22.4% on a GAAP basis, and that compares to GAAP effective tax rate of 44.1%. But again, on a non-GAAP basis for the full year, the effective tax rate was 23.8% and compares to 26.8% in 2017. Again, you can see a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the supplemental information page on the IR section of our website. For 2019, we estimate our effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%, and that's also on a non-GAAP basis. ","Moving on. Net income attributable to Henry Schein for Q4 of 2018 was $133 million or $0.87 per diluted share. And this compares with the prior year GAAP net loss of $8.5 million or $0.06 per share. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $171.6 million or $1.12 per diluted share. And this compares with the non-GAAP net income of $152.1 million or $0.97 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. This represents growth of 12.9% and 15.5%, respectively. ","To provide some additional detail on our results, we note that the amortization from acquired intangible assets was $30.4 million pretax or $0.15 per diluted share for Q4 of the current year. That compares to $28.3 million pretax or $0.13 per diluted share for Q4 last year. On a full year basis, the amortization from acquired intangible's was $122 million pretax or $0.60 per diluted share for 2018, and that compares to $112.4 million pretax or $0.52 per diluted share for 2017. I'll also note that in the current quarter, Q4 of 2018, foreign currency exchange negatively impacted our EPS by $0.02. ","Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales were $1.7 billion, which is a decrease of 0.2% compared with the prior year with internal growth in local currencies of 1.5%. North American internal growth in local currencies was 0.6% and included 2.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise where we believe there was some softness in the end market, most notably in the November and December periods. But we do believe we continue to gain market share in the North American dental consumable merchandise market. Our dental equipment sales and service revenue decreased by 3.5% year-over-year. It's important to point out, though, that this was against a very difficult prior year comparison where we experienced adjusted internal sales growth in local currencies above 19%. We also believe dental practices we're focused on some year-end optimization of some practice cash structures rather than on tax advantages associated with capital purchases. And we believe this could have negatively impacted Q4 sales as well. ","Turning to international. Our international dental sales growth in local currencies was 2.8% and included 3.4% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. And our dental equipment sales and service revenue increased by 1.3% versus the same period last year. I'll note that the biannual international dental tradeshow or IBS takes place in Cologne, Germany in mid-March. And this -- generally, the timing of this often impacts lower international equipment sales in Q1 that typically pick up in Q2 and beyond. ","Animal Health sales were $877.6 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 1.4% with internally generated sales in local currencies down 0.6%. These results included 1.9% sales decline in North America. However, normalizing for the impact of the manufacture switching from direct to agency sales, our North American sales growth was 2.1%. International Animal Health internal sales growth in local currencies was 0.8%. ","Our Medical sales were $684.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 7.5% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies also at the 7.5%. And acquisition growth was small, up 0.1%., and that was offset by foreign exchange of the same amount, 0.1%. That 7.5% internal growth in local currencies included 7.7% growth in North America and 2.1% growth internationally. We are pleased with our overall Medical sales results, which continue to be driven primarily by solid growth in existing large customers as well as, to a lesser extent, new customer additions. And this was despite the fact that there was a below average influenza season that led to fewer position office businesses and related test. This was probably the mildest flu vaccine -- or flu season that we've seen in the number of years. ","Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $139.1 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 21.4% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 0.5%. In North America, Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth in local currencies was flat versus the prior year, reflecting lower sales from technology support and financing services revenue associated with the decline in dental equipment sales in North America. International markets, the internal sales growth for technology was 2.8%. And we expect to see an acceleration over time in our technology sales driven by Henry Schein One as practices leverage those key tools, including the availability of integrated practice management software systems with the Internet brands offering to enhance practice efficiency and patient communications. ","Related to stock repurchases, we continue to repurchase common stock in the open market in the fourth quarter. We bought back 997,000 shares at an average price of $86.14. Remember, that's on a pre spin-off basis, that $86 share price. And that was approximately $86 million. The impact of these repurchases on the fourth quarter EPS was immaterial. Also, I'll remind people that on December 13 of 2018, we announced our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of shares of our common stock. That's an additional increase. And at fiscal year-end, we had that $400 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases. ","If we look at some of the highlights of cash flow for the quarter, our operating cash flow for the 4Q was very strong at $294 million compared with $238 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, the operating cash flow was $685 million versus $545 million in 2017. Also, we'll look at our capital expenditures for the year was about $90.6 million, and that results in free cash flow of $594 million for the year. ","I'll also remind people that as part of the spin-off, we will see the $1.1 billion tax free cash proceeds that were distributed to us at the closing of the Animal Health transaction, which was during the first quarter of 2019. That was initially used to pay down corporate debt. Also, early in the year, we repurchased a minority interest associated with the Animal Health business in the U.S. Animal Health business in the amount of approximately $365 million. Our Animal Health subsidiary subsequently engaged in a primary issuance of shares to third parties with cash consideration, which was also distributed to us in connection with the spin-off transaction. We expect to continue our long-standing capital allocation, which is focused on 2 key initiatives, strategic acquisitions as well as share repurchases. ","Looking ahead to future M&A. We expect to continue to pursue our 2018 and 2020 strategic plan by continuing to grow our Dental and Medical businesses, both in North America as well as internationally. Also, to enhance our value-added solutions, investing in building scale and expanding into higher-margin products. This is expected to include adding higher-margin dental technologies to the Henry Schein One platform aimed at improving practice efficiency and creating patient demand for our customers. We also expect to continue to invest in dental specialty solutions for implants, bone regeneration, endodontic, orthodontic products, which will complement the growth profile of our traditional Dental business. In addition, we plan to invest as opportunities arrive in the Medical market such as what we just recently announced in the North American Rescue business, which Stan will discuss shortly. ","As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in Q4 of 2018 of $35.4 million or $0.17 per diluted share. The charge for the full year of restructuring activities was $62.9 million on a pretax basis or $0.31 per diluted share. These restructuring charges primarily includes severance pay as well as facility closing costs and outside professional and consulting fees that were directly related to the restructuring plan. We plan on extending this restructuring initiative into the first half of 2019 as we continue to look for more opportunities to save costs; as we continue to look to migrate stranded cost, which are modestly this year but we still want the opportunity to mitigate those stranded cost over time that are related to the Animal Health spin-off; as well as advance our technology investments, including reinvestment in our CRM, ERP and web interface development. ","Okay. Turning to guidance. We are introducing financial guidance today for 2019. At this time, we are not able to provide estimates for the continued costs associated with restructuring as well as Animal Health spin-off that occurred earlier in 2019. Therefore, we are -- 2019. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. We will only be provided non-GAAP guidance excluding those 2 items. On a non-GAAP basis for 2019, diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $3.38 to $3.46, and that reflects growth of 7% to 9% compared with the 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $3.17. Again, if you look at our press release, you'll see that $3.17 is provided as a non-audited additional financial information for Henry Schein on a continuing operations basis. ","The company's Animal Health business was [indiscernible] to shareholders on February 7, 2019. And that business will be classified as a discontinued operation in Q1 2019 as well as for all current and prior year prior -- periods that are presented post Q1 2019. ","Note that we currently expect a year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth in the first quarter of 2019 to be in the low single digits with an acceleration for the remainder of the year. Our guidance for 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein again is for continuing operations and includes a completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions as well as it does not include the impact of those non-GAAP adjustments. The guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels, and that the end markets remain stable to current market conditions that we are seeing. ","So we remain confident in our goal of achieving long-term organic sales growth of 1 to 2 percentage points above the underlying market growth rates. We also remain confident that non-GAAP diluted EPS growth will continue to be in the high single to low double-digit percentages for Henry Schein, Inc. on a long-term basis. And that's all including stock repurchases as well as contributions from acquisitions. ","So with that financial summary, I will now turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Before I review highlights from the fourth quarter, I would like to review several highlights of 2018. We achieved net sales of $13.2 billion, which is up 5.9% from the prior year. Internal sales in local currencies increased by 3.4%. GAAP diluted EPS increased by 35.8% versus 2017 non-GAAP results. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth was 14.7% versus 2017 non-GAAP results. We are, of course, pleased with our operating cash flow of $684.7 million, which increased by $139.2 million versus 2017. We did not repurchase shares during the period of time before we announced the spin-off of our Animal Health business. Following the announcement in April, we spent $200 million to repurchase approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock in 2018, reflecting our confidence in the strength of our business and our commitment to continuing to deliver shareholder value. ","In addition, 2018 -- during the year 2018, we completed 5 major -- majority-owned strategic transactions excluding Animal Health transactions, just Dental and Medical, as we continue to expand our geographic presence and enhance our product offering. Together, these acquisitions have trading 12 months' revenue at the time of purchase of approximately $132 million. We also announced the formation of Henry Schein One, which had pro forma 2017 sales of approximately $400 million. Our acquisitions in 2018 expanded our digital dentistry solutions for implants and orthodontics. And in Medical, we announced an agreement to acquire a leading provider of mission-critical medical products for the defense and Public Safety markets, North American Rescue. ","Going forward, we have significant opportunities to allocate capital towards advancing our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan, which is centered around 3 concepts, 3 major goals. Just on the distribution side, the goal of expansion of our core dental and Medical businesses as we continue to build scale and expand into new geographies. Supplementing that with number two, value-added services, advancing our solutions, services and support for our customers. Of course, a key component of that is Henry Schein One, but there are other initiatives and other programs that we will be advancing. And the third component is partnering with a broad set of manufacturers as well as building Henry Schein brand equity with key goal of expanding product margins. ","So for the fourth quarter of 2018, let me start with a review of our Dental business. Steven mentioned that the fourth quarter dental sales in North America were impacted by a soft end market in November and December. Also, our global sales of -- in the CAD\/CAM category declined by approximately 7%. As Steve noted, we faced a difficult comparison in North America dental equipment for the fourth quarter 2017. Remember, it was the first full quarter that we have access to Dentsply Sirona Dental equipment line in the U.S., which we believe contributed to a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter and specifically around CAD\/CAM. We're on the early stages of adoption of digital solutions for dental practices and dental laboratories, including CAD\/CAM products. At market, though, it's estimated still less than 20% penetrated in the U.S. Without question, the dental market will continue to adopt digital technology as digital devices drive practice efficiency and productivity. Growth in this market over the coming years is expected to be healthy. ","In terms of sales, North American traditional equipment grew by 3.8% in local currencies during the fourth quarter. This was off of solid sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe this market will continue to grow as well. We believe investors should not be overly focused on quarterly growth rates, which may ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. We believe the end markets for dental consumables, digital equipment and traditional equipment have all grown. We remain optimistic that long-term growth prospects remain attractive, and we expect that we will continue our trend of building upon our market share positions. ","As you may recall, in late September, we announced investments in three implant companies: Intra-Lock, Medentis Medical and Pro-Cam Implants with combined annual sales of approximately $45 million. The implant, orthodontic and endodontic markets represent particularly attractive growth segments where we can leverage our deep relationships with both specialty practitioners and GPs. Our investments in these companies speak to our commitment to adding high-margin digital treatment solutions that are advancing dentistry through technology and innovation. ","Before we move on, let me comment on the agreement we recently signed to acquire a majority stake in Yu Han Hong Chen [ph], one of the largest independent dental distributors in China. The company has annual sales of approximately $40 million. China is an important market for dental services as the dental clinics, the private sector dental clinics, continue to experience rapid growth. In 2018, had approximately $60 million of dental sales in China, and expect us to grow significantly in 2019 and beyond as we continue to invest in growing our presence in developing markets. We believe there is significant opportunity to deliver our unique combination of solutions, service and support to the China region as well as other emerging markets. ","Now let's move on to Animal Health business. We are pleased to have closed on the spin-off of our global Animal Health business, which is now part of Covetrus. The company has an impressive board made up of 11 leaders in the industry. We are pleased that Phil Laskawy, the independently leader at -- for Henry Schein for many years, is the lead Director of Covetrus. Steven Paladino, our CFO, also serves on the Covetrus board, among the many distinguished colleagues. ","I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the former members of the Animal Health team. For many years, the Team Schein Members devoted to the Animal Health part of Henry Schein were very productive for the company. It creates a tremendous shareholder value, and the commitment over so many years of this team is most appreciated. The team has a strong passion and dedication to the Animal Health community and, therefore, the combination of Henry Schein Animal Health and Vets First Choice capabilities position this team and Covetrus as a company for a bright future. ","Now let's take a look at the Medical business. We are pleased with the robust growth in our Medical sales for the quarter at 7.5%. The North American Medical market continues to experience a rapid evolution as health care providers pursue the best way to deliver services at lower cost and with better outcomes, of course. We are benefiting from the shift in care from higher cost acute settings the lower cost subacute care sites such as physician offices, urgent care sites and ambulatory care centers that we serve. Our track record is serving large group networks with supply chain, education, technology and support services continues to be a solid competitive advantage. Our Medical business is thriving in this environment as we service these large entities. In January, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 93% of North American Rescue or NAR, as it is referred to in the marketplace, which is a leading provider of survivable and quality care Medical products to defense and Public Safety markets. NAR has an extensive line of proprietary product brands. The company has 105 employees and generate record sales for the 12 months ended October 2018 of approximately $184 million. We believe NAR will help expand our Medical group geographic footprint, customer base and product offering as well as margins in both the U.S. and as we advance NAR business across the globe. ","Let's move on to our Technology and Value-Added Services business. Henry Schein One has just completed its first two quarters as a combined platform and is now positioned to start offering unique software bundle solutions for improved communications between the practice and the patient while, of course, driving efficiency and good clinical outcomes in the practice as well. Henry Schein One is helping to advance practice efficiency and to build strong relationships between dental practices and patients. It is also creating new avenues for growth for practices with differentiated demand creation tools. We're offering our customers a host of new tools to engage with their patients while simultaneously increasing the recurring revenue. We also have the opportunity with this exciting platform to expand our dental software ability across the globe, particularly as we pair these tools with the growing practice management software presence abroad. We are pleased to announce that Dentrix Enterprise solutions, along with Cerner solutions, was selected for the contract with the Department of Veterinary Affairs as part of the project to modernize health care solutions for the military. Recently, Henry Schein One rolled out several key platform updates for patient engagement, patient financing and clinical decision support solutions. We also launched our OmniCore all-in-one dental office Medical solution, which includes hardware and dental office maintenance. Looking ahead, we are working on new product launches to attract new patients, so our customers as well as live check solutions aimed at improving conversation rates as patients search online for dentists. ","Henry Schein One has a lot of projects underway, and we serve as a platform for future technology acquisitions to expand our value-added solutions in other geographies and to target general practitioners as well as specialty practitioners, including the previously announced unconsolidated investment in Robo 2, a leading provider of Practice Management's software solutions for orthodontists in the United States and Canada. ","Before we open the call to questions, I would like to address some concerns that we've received from the investment community about growth and operating margin. I really think it's important to reiterate thoughts that we have conveyed for some time. First, we recognize that we have always have been and will continue to operate in a price competitive markets. The markets we have -- and have always been price competitive. Our strategy of delivering value-added solutions for our customers that help clinicians manage their practices efficiently is critical. This helps our customers operate more successful practices, both from the clinical point of view and an economic point of view. We also recognize that practices are changing. Consolidation will continue as we believe at different rates in dental and medical. I would like to point out our success in continuing to bring value to our large customers and to navigate consolidation in the medical market where today, the majority of smaller practices are owned by larger group networks. We continue to deliver consistent attractive sales and profit in this business. We believe our medical and dental customers continue to choose Henry Schein because we are partnered with practitioners and effectively serve as an extension to their practices. Our price levels fairly reflect the value we provide. It's a careful balance that we work on daily. We do not expect this to change materially over time even as our customers continue to consolidate. Rather, we expect practitioners will continue to compensate us for the value we provide. ","Second, we have discussed the priority of adding more high-margin products to our portfolio. The recent implant acquisitions in dental and agreements acquired in North American Rescue and Medical are excellent examples. We will also continue the invest in building scale in distribution in all our key markets as we positioned the company to grow in these important markets. Our capital structure and strong balance sheet position us well to continue to add more of these businesses in the future. ","Finally, we believe in our success in effectively managing gross margins and cost. And this has been a long-term history of ours, aided by our recent restructuring efforts, will help us achieve our long-term operating margin expansion goals. ","With that, operator, we will open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Jeffrey Johnson","Can you hear me okay?","Stanley Bergman","Yes, we can.","Jeffrey Johnson","So I just wanted to focus on guidance here for a second and kind of even your 2018 base number of $3.17. So Steve, I think we're all trying to circle around 3 different factors. There's stranded costs that are impacting. There's the TSA agreements with Covetrus that should help at least in 2019. And then there was the cash infusion from Covetrus, the $1.1 billion. So in that $3.17 number, I guess, my question is are there any impacts of any of those 3 factors? And then how are you thinking those 3 factors combined to impact then the 7% to 9% growth guidance for 2019?","Stanley Bergman","Okay. So the 2018 numbers, there are no real impact related to stranded cost because nothing is stranded during 2018. And there is no impact to TSAs and reimbursement in 2018. And last, since we didn't get the cash until first week of February 2019, the impact of the $1.1 billion is also not included in 2018. Let's address those issues in 2019 because I understand there is a little bit of confusion on that. First, on the cash infusion, it's 11 months worth of impact, but it's important to note a couple of things on our interest rate line. One is that we had temporary credit lines in place in anticipation of getting that billion dollar-plus cash infusion. Those temporary credit lines have low interest rates because they were floating in low interest rate credit lines. We'll also have assumed that there will be some rate increases in 2019. Who knows if that's going to happen or not, but for conservatism, we did assume in our guidance that there would be some rate increases in 2019 that will increase our overall interest expense.","Turning to stranded cost. We do expect to have a modest amount in 2019 of stranded cost. We expect that to be in the several million dollar range. That could change a little bit, but that's the expectation now that's built into our guidance. We also expect that when you look at the cost in 2018, it does not include certain variable cost that will increase in providing those services to Covetrus. So the 2019 expenses will be higher because there'll be more variable expenses that will be chargeable to Covetrus to perform their services. And the last thing maybe I'll point out is we're still expecting -- you see in Q4 that foreign exchange, currency translation negatively impacted our quarter by $0.02 per share. It's just for the quarter. So we're expecting to have a little bit of continued headwind in foreign exchange built into our guidance. And then the last thing I'll mention, sorry for such a long-winded answer, is that we saw in Q4 a soft market in a couple of markets. And we are also assuming that market conditions remain consistent. So we're assuming that, well, let me say the opposite. We are not assuming that market conditions improve. Now we're hopeful that, that can also be a conservative assumption. But right now, we think that's the best way of building our guidance, assuming the market conditions remain consistent with what we've seen in recent history.","Jeffrey Johnson","That's helpful, Steve. And just my very quick follow-up. On the amended 8-K that you filed on Friday and the restated pro forma numbers for 2018 year-to-date have come down in that filing, was that -- did those numbers come down because of stranded cost? Or did those numbers come down because you just allocated or reallocated and decided that there were more cost remaining on the business that forced you to do that or that required you to do the restatement of the 8-K?","Steven Paladino","Yes. So it was the latter. It was not because of stranded cost. It was because when we filed the initial 8-K, and it's a very complication -- complicated separation of cost between continued and discontinued operations, and we made estimates for what pertains to continued versus discontinued operations. And as we continue to refine those numbers, we realized that those estimates were not as accurate as we would've liked. And therefore, we filed that 8-K last week to adjust for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Maybe just sticking on guidance. You talked about EPS growth of 7% to 9% from continuing operations. That, I guess, is at the lower end of the longer-term target of high single to low double digits. So Steve, can you maybe just talk about what's unique to this year that's causing growth to be at the lower end of that range? And maybe within that, could you also comment specifically on your expectations for margins. They look like pro forma margin were roughly flat. I'll just be curious what you're expecting for 2019.","Steven Paladino","Sure. Some of the things I said on the earlier questions, I'll repeat. There is an impact of stranded cost in 2019. We are anticipating some foreign exchange headwind. Maybe another thing I'll mention is -- that talked about on the prepared comments. If you look at the flu season this year, it was the mildest flu season in many years. And while that did not impact our sales of the influenza vaccine, it did impact and we're seeing that continue in Q1. We're seeing that patient traffic for when patients have flu-like symptoms and they go to their doctor and there's the rapid in-office flu test that's used, those who flu test product sales are down in Q1 because again, such a mild season in the patient traffic. So using other products that you normally use when you have a patient flow is also down. It's a temporary thing because the flu season really is the winter months and it ends after Q1. But we are assuming softness related to that. It's a very unusual season, and we just have to build in the reality of that as part of our guidance.","Nathan Rich","Okay. And just really quickly on margins. Just your expectations. There are a number of moving pieces just with the restructuring savings. Do you expect -- in some of the stranded cost like you said. So just curious how we should be thinking about margins for the year.","Steven Paladino","Yes. Look, our long-term goal is to get back to operating margin expansion. I think that we may not get there in 2019 because of stranded cost and some of the other factors that we just discussed. But we do believe longer term, we can get there. So again, 2019 is a little bit of a transitional year with all the spin-off activities that we have to take into consideration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Stan, you mentioned a few minutes ago that the product is the third of your 3 main goals longer term. Can you just elaborate on that? How do you determine what products you want to own versus you want to partner for? And if we think about your sales, what percentage would you like to get into some sort of kind of a preferred formulary type of structure? And any additional details would be really helpful.","Stanley Bergman","It's a very, very good question. I'm glad you asked it. Look, the 3 legs of Henry Schein's strategy for 2018 and '20, the first is to continue to advance our distribution businesses. I can go into details, but that's not related to your question. The second is to continue to invest and expand our presence with value-added services. There are 2 kinds of services. Some are given free or virtually free to customers who give us consumables and equipment business. And others such as the programs of Henry Schein One are charged for. So there, obviously, we want to expand on that platform and we'll connect with suppliers and different partners that are interested in working with us to help us expanding that platform, the profitability of that platform and the connectivity to our customers so that we can be totally interoperable in a unique way. But I think your question is more directed to the third category, it's what we call internally brand equity. The cornerstone of that, of course, is our specialty businesses. ","We're particularly interested in advancing our oral surgery business that involves implants and bone regeneration materials and using that to be a one-stop shop for all products in oral surgeon or GP in the oral surgery field is -- are using. We are doing quite well in that field. We are gaining market share. We have made some good investments, and we expect to continue to make good investments in that field. The second area will be in the endodontic space. Similar goal. We, of course, will distribute all brand, but we also have our own brands from brushlets to edge and I'm sure others will be added over time. This is a high-margin business for us and presents us with a good opportunity. We will continue to collaborate with those branded manufacturers that will want to collaborate with us where other brands are offered to the Henry Schein channel. And the third is the orthodontic space where we will continue to invest. Again, we're making good progress. We have some good proprietary products in that field, and specifically related to our SLX Clear Aligner system and the whole system around that. And we believe that over time, that will continue to do well. We are receiving very good feedback from our KOLs and from customers in that regard. So the goal is specifically in those areas where we are not really competing with our manufacturers who work with us for distribution. We do not see ourselves being a manufacturer of equipment. And so for example, and so we will focus on areas where we believe the margins are great where we can provide good value to our customers and can combine our own brands with a complete offering of other products to present a one-stop shop.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jonathan Block","Steve, this one might be for you. I'm sorry, Stanley as well. But I just want to make on the trends if I circle back. And so on the North American trend that you called out that weakened a little bit in November and December, I mean, here we are almost at the end of February. Any color that you can give on how those trended in January and February as well? And then I guess, a quick add-on to that same question will just be also any difference that you saw in general consumables versus specialty? Because I do think specialty has been more resilient in the past. And then I just got a quick follow-up.","Steven Paladino","Sure. So let me answer the second part of your question first. Specialty sales were stronger than core GP sales. In fact, for us, we saw our implant business growth in the 7% range, organic growth in the 7% range, which was strong a number for us. And we also saw another specialties and some nice growth in excess of the recorded growth. What we saw specifically in the U.S. and North American market was that the softness really continued in January, but we did see a really nice pickup so far in February. So we're a little bit optimistic with that pickup because February so far has been very strong, and it's only, call it, 2 weeks into the February months. So that's the color I can provide, and that's both on consumables and equipment. Softness in January continued but a nice turnaround in February for an acceleration of that growth.","Stanley Bergman","Like me just add one other factor. And it's not directly related to Steven's answer per se and maybe your question. But the profitability of Henry Schein One and the profitability of our specialty businesses are significantly higher than distribution business. So although the impact of top line our growth in these businesses may not be that material or not be obvious, the bottom line increase is quite important. And in fact, even if we don't have much growth and we expect to have a lot of growth, the profitability increase in these businesses is very, very good. So the opportunity to have growth in operating margin and bottom line profitability or operating income profitability from Henry Schein One and the specialty businesses is, of course, therefore, disproportionate to the sales growth of the distribution businesses.","Jonathan Block","Okay, fantastic. And just as a follow-up question is it sort of built on maybe Nathan's from earlier. But just longer term, Steven, the up margin goal for the company, you talked about why it may be flat. This year, you've got some stranded costs, you've got some FX headwinds. But when we look at longer term, you used to talk about 20 bps of O&M expansion for the legacy co. Do you see you that as sort of recapture 20 bps longer term? Does it even work beyond that as Stanley, to your point, you made some acquisitions and bolt-ons in some of these higher-margin business such as specialty Henry Schein One, et cetera?","Steven Paladino","Sure, John. You're correct. We do feel confident longer term to get back to operating margin expansion. Again, this is a little bit of a transition year, 2019, because of the spin-off and other activities. That does not assume any major shift in sales next to higher margin. We're still targeting that longer-term margin expansion of 20 bps. But if the shift is greater through acquisitions, that could accelerate 20 bps to a higher number. So we still feel like that's a model that we can continue to achieve. We just have to get through 2019 in this transitional year.","Stanley Bergman","And of course, our guidance to add on, Steve, does not include any acquisitions. We cannot, of course, commit to any acquisitions until the paper is signed. But we will be investing quite heavily in these 2 legs of higher margin. One is Henry Schein One. It's a tremendous platform and a great way to add additional services, additional geographies to the Henry Schein One platform. Lots of opportunity there for margin expansion. And likewise, in the specialty areas where we can remain excited and think that we have opportunity to continue to grow market share in a market that is quite healthy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich","I guess, Steve, you gave us some nice color on the softness that you saw in the dental market in North America and kind of how it's balanced here in February. But were you ever able to pinpoint what caused the softness? I mean, is it really just kind of a resetting also, what market growth is for the market?","Steven Paladino","It's difficult to answer with precision. We did see the large corporate accounts grow faster than the independent customers. We didn't see anything specific geographically or regionally. And obviously, it was related to patient traffic and utilization. So again, we're trying to continue to do analytics on that, but it's difficult to understand with precision. So again, reflected in our guidance is a continued slightly softer market expectations that will continue. Again, we still feel we can grow. Assuming we achieve our guidance of high single digits, 7% to 9% growth in this environment, and the opportunity for that accelerate over time with acquisitions, other activities and maybe even a little bit of help from the end markets. And we feel that, that's something that will continue to deliver shareholder value for our shareholders.","Kevin Ellich","That's helpful. And then Stan, when we think about your growth strategy, and you guys give some color on higher-margin equipment in digital areas that you want to get into, can you talk geographically about the emerging markets? You mentioned China as a big opportunity. Kind of will you build that organically? Or do you think an acquisition is more of the right way to go about building in the emerging markets?","Stanley Bergman","It's a very good question, Kevin. Of course, the emerging markets are growing rapidly off a smaller base. The answer is slightly different per country. China now, we've been there for almost a decade and feel very comfortable now that we have the right infrastructure, financial and regulatory and legal to advance. We have a $60 million business. We will close shortly on another $14 million, and we will continue to grow organically. It's a great platform, by the way, to advance our implant businesses, which is doing quite well with us in China. So it's going to be, in China, a combination of organic growth and expanding the platform so that we have good distribution throughout China. Brazil, for example, which is now a nice business for us, we put together the #1 and #2 player. They went through last year the integration process. And I expect that we will continue to have good growth and profitability in Brazil. I expect that there will also be some acquisition opportunities and specifically in the specialty areas as well. We have a small operation in South Africa, which is an opportunity to expand north. Although it's not a huge market, it's a growing market. And in other parts of Asia, for example, Thailand, you may ask why we went to Thailand. We just found a good company. Those opportunities advance our business in the Southeast Asian region and specifically, we think in the digital area, where we have some good capability and combined with our oral surgery program. So I can talk about other countries as well, but those are the key areas that we're focused on today. And see, these are good markets growing. We see good opportunity to take our products that we have and know-how that we have and take advantage of markets that are healthy and growing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Larson with SVB Leerink.","David Larsen","Can you talk about Henry Schein One product? And you keep mentioning demand generation tools and being able to drive traffic to the dental offices. I think you also mentioned there is $400 million of sales. What exactly are those tools? And how permeated is the solution into like your dental base? Can you reach all of your dental clients now or not? And sort of how do you expect that penetration to progress over time?","Steven Paladino","Sure. So I'll give a little bit of color. One of the things that I would invite people, we have had some people, some investors go out to our technology center in Salt Lake City and the people would like to get a demo and -- of the technology and the software that drives this, we can set something up. But quickly in summary, we have a number of terrific products now with the creation of Henry Schein One that drive patient communications that are effectively smart communications to be able to go to patients and communicate with them and get them back into a dental office for treatment plans that have not been performed or to get them back in the office because they've been away for too long. We believe that the average dental office might have close to a year's worth of billings for treatment plants that were diagnosed when patients have not returned. We could also include in there, we have some certain products with Henry Schein One that can help with either patient financing as well as some insurance programs that could help those patients if it's partly a financial issue to get those services performed. ","So it's really detailed and smart patient communications to bring those customers, those patients back into the dental office. We've seen success. It's a service, it's a monthly service that dental practices will buy monthly and effectively outsource the patient communications to us. And it's been very effective. We also have recording that shows them the effectiveness of what we're doing. And I would say that if you ask any dental practice what the top 3 concerns are, patient traffic and demand is probably in those top 3. So this really addresses something very important to the dental practice and really addresses the value of Henry Schein that we're more than just, again, a rigid supply of products from point A to point B. Yes, we do that better than anyone else and we're very efficient at that. But we provide so many other services, and this is just one of those. So hopefully, that helps with a little bit of color. Again, if everyone likes to get detailed demos of those products, we can try to set something up. Maybe we can even do something remote where people can call into a webinar of sorts.","Stanley Bergman","In the general enterprise systems that we offer, for small practices, midsize practices, large practices, U.S. government, for example, military, the PA, these are all customized solutions that are very, very effective in managing the practice per se but helping with clinical outcomes.","David Larsen","Okay. And then just in terms of like traffic volume to dental offices, do you think the nature of the stock market and the S&P 500 has anything to do with that? Like if people see the market pulling in and late in the year, they're less inclined to have services performed, and if the market comes back and they see the value of their savings rising and they're more inclined to use sort of their savings to have services? Any correlation there in your mind or not? What do you think?","Stanley Bergman","There are so many discussions internally with our salespeople about customers. Everybody has a view. There are people that say that when Christmas and new year sales had caused lost days of activity. There are people and talk about the weather. There are people that do talk about the impact of the stock markets on the consumer and on the enthusiasm of the dentists invest in the practice. I think these things all have short-term impact. But I think in the end, we have to look at how the business performs over any year, 1, 2, 3 years. And I think we are as well positioned as we've ever been to continue to grow EPS. I think the number of 7% to 9% is on the low end, specifically because 2019 is a transition year. There's so much going on. I think we need to be a little cautious, including where is the world economy heading, where is foreign exchange going. But I think once things settle down in 2020 going forward, I think the goals that we set for ourselves at nine to low single digits -- high single digits to low double digits, 9%, 11%, 12% is something that we're comfortable with. I think we're investing in the right areas. We are returning cash that we have into investment. We heavily invest in the first year with expenses because you have a lot of you have a lot of acquisition cost, and some types of businesses, you have to write-down inventory. You have to take amortization charges. So overall, we take this into account. I think our three-pronged strategy is very, very exciting. We have a great theme in place in each one of our businesses really to execute, really to advance organic growth and, of course, ready to deploy capital on an internal competitive basis because we will go to where the returns are the best.","Operator","We have time for one last question coming from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays.","Steven Valiquette","Just really two quick clarification questions here. First, when you mentioned that for 2019 that the guidance assumes that the market trends will be in line with recent history, I just want to confirm whether or not you're referring to the softer trends in November or December in particular. And really without getting at it, if we think about just 2019 overall versus 2018 overall dental market, are you assuming similar trend year-over-year or down year-over-year? I just want to sort of clarify your exact comment around that.","Steven Paladino","Sure. So I would say it's a little bit down compared to full year 2018. It does reflect the most recent history of a little softness in Q4 that continued into January. Again, so hard to tell how -- whether that's an anomaly or whether that's going to stick around for a couple of few quarters. So we're trying to be a little bit conservative to assume that.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, great. And the other one quickly. You mentioned that the $1.1 billion dividend was used initially to pay down some debt. I don't know how current that 8-K was a few weeks ago, but could you give a number how much debt you paid down so far in calendar '19?","Steven Paladino","Yes. We used the entire $1.1 billion to pay down in short-term debt that was floating rate debt. It's not in the 8-K because the 8-K only covers 2018. So the proceeds weren't received until early February of 2019. So it's not in the 8-K.","Steven Valiquette","So you basically used all of it at this point in 1Q '19 to pay down debt? Okay, great.","Steven Paladino","Yes. Okay, good.","Stanley Bergman","So I think we need to end the call because we committed to an hour and we've gone over an hour. Sorry for the length of the initial introduction. But of course, we had to put things into perspective. Let me just close, and I really -- a lot of my remarks were included in the response to the second or the last question -- the second to the last question. We're very excited about the future of Henry Schein. We're in the right spot. Wellness and prevention is important and managing health care costs, managing the wellness of the world population. And so I think we are well positioned, and I think our focus on the human side of wellness and prevention is going to pay off nicely for our investors long term. We continue on our path of success. It's been many years, [indiscernible] as a private company and 24th year as a public company. We have great themes. ","We've got good disciplines within the business. And the Medical and dental customers understand us. Our brand is good. We will continue to provide innovative solutions. We do work on this. We dream about this, think about every day, every hour. And the team is really focused on, as I said, wellness and prevention and enabling our customers across the globe to focus and delivering quality clinical care while actually running a good business. Steven and Carolynne are heading to Chicago this afternoon for the midwinter dental tradeshow, which is one of our biggest dental conventions in North America. Unfortunately, I'm not joining them this year as I recently had a back surgery. It was most successful, but my doctor has advised me not to travel by plane for a month. Rest assured I'm going to be working very hard. And I will be at the IDS. There's a meeting in Chicago and Cologne next month. So I'm in good shape health-wise, and you're in good hands with Steven and Carolynne. Please feel free to visit our booth. I'd be happy to also arrange for a tour of certain software systems and other interesting areas of the Henry Schein story. Again, Steven and Carolynne are ready to answer any questions. If you have further questions specifically, try Carolynne Borders or hit up Investor Relations at 631-390-8105. And of course, if you want to get Steven, too, he's available. I look forward to reporting back to you our first quarter results. Be back in May and very, very excited, as I said, about the future of Henry Schein. Our team is enthusiastic. We've got good plans. And last year was a historical year. We made significant movements, and the team is excited about continuing in the direction as we describe. So thank you for your interest.","Operator","Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"10843":["Henry Schein, Inc.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and my thanks to each of you for joining us today to discuss Henry Schein's results for the third quarter of 2015. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking.

As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.

Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are so pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflected accelerated growth in adjusted diluted EPS, as well as in worldwide sales despite the continued negative impact of the strength of the United States dollar. As was also the case during the first quarter, the first half, actually, of the year, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations during the third quarter and particularly those in Europe.","For the quarter, changes in currency exchange reduced our total sales growth by nearly 6% and reduced EPS by $0.06, both compared with the previous year \u2013 with last year. Yet, overall, the global markets we serve continue to be stable.","Through our long-standing strategy of organic growth, complemented by strategic acquisitions, we believe we continued to gain market share on an overall basis during the quarter both in North America and internationally.","Today, we are pleased to introduce guidance for the 2016 adjusted diluted EPS that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared with the midpoint of our new adjusted 2015 guidance range. In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments, but first, Steve Paladino will review our quarterly financial results. Steve.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning. I am also pleased to report solid results for the third quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pre-tax or $0.08 per diluted shares. Our most recent estimate of restructuring costs to be recorded in 2015 has been reduced to $30 million to $35 million pre-tax or approximately $0.26 to $ 0.30 per diluted share. This is a reduction from our original estimate of $35 million to $40 million pre-tax. And this reduced estimate is the result of certain restructuring actions being deferred to 2016.","As such, we expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the first half of 2016. Our Q3 results also include a one-time income tax benefit, net of a non-controlling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share. And that's related to a favorable tax ruling that we received during the third quarter.","I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis which will exclude both the restructuring costs and the impact of the tax benefit since we believe that the latter is more useful for comparative purposes. You can refer to exhibit B of this morning's earnings news release, and that reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations.","Turning to our Q3 results, our net sales for the quarter ended September 26 of 2015, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 2.4% increase compared with the third quarter of 2014. This consisted of an 8.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 5.9% related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies or constant currencies, our internal generated sales growth was 4.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 3.5%. You can see the details of sales growth in exhibit A of today's earnings news release.","Our operating margin for the quarter was 7.0% and expanded by 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. However, on a non-GAAP basis, which would exclude the restructuring costs, our adjusted operating margin for the third quarter of 2015 improved by 71 basis points and was 7.4%. This expansion, which was very strong for the quarter, was a result of both higher gross margin as well as a reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of sales.","If you look to our effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 29.6% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, we're excluding the one-time tax benefit and the restructuring costs to show the non-GAAP effective tax rate and that compares to 30.0% last year. Again, the lower tax rate is due to ongoing tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rate.","We continue to expect that our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in this 30% range for the remainder of the year, as well as going forward into next year. Our net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the third quarter of 2015 was $127.7 million or $1.52 per diluted share. This represented growth of 11.3% and 13.4%, respectively, compared to the prior year.","However, again on a non-GAAP basis, net income attributable to Henry Schein was higher or $130.6 million or $1.55 per diluted share and that growth is 13.7% and 15.7% respectively, again compared to the prior year.","I think it's important to reiterate that the foreign currency exchange impact was not only negative $0.06 for the quarter on our EPS, but it's approximately $0.20 for the first nine months of the year, and that's just converting foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at today's average rate versus last year's average rate. So, it has been a big headwind for us in the current year.","Let me now turn to our sales results, and review some details there. Our dental sales for the third quarter of 2015 declined by 2.5% to $1.3 billion, but again, this is related to foreign currency. The 2.5% decline consisted of 4.6% growth in constant currency and 7.1% decline related to foreign currency.","In local currencies, our internally generated sales was 4.1% and acquisition growth contributed another 0.5%. Of that 4.1% internal growth in constant currencies, it consisted of two components, 4.4% growth in North America and 3.6% growth internationally.","Let's look at some additional detail on each of those figures. First, the North American internal growth of 4.4% consists of 3.8% growth in dental consumable merchandise sales and 6.4% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue.","Looking at the international business, the 3.6% constant currency internal growth included 2.9% growth in dental consumable merchandise and 5.3% growth in dental equipment sales revenue. So across the board on global dental, we showed solid sales growth both in consumables and equipment domestically and internationally.","Turning to Animal Health sales, they were $732.5 million in the third quarter, down 3.4%, but the components there is 4.5% local currency growth and a decline related to foreign currency exchange of 7.9%. Internal sales growth in constant currencies grew 0.5%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 4.0% to growth. That 0.5% internal growth in constant currencies included a 1.9% decline in North America and 2.7% growth internationally.","Again, as we've done for the first two quarters, we are normalizing our sales growth in international, and that 1.9% decline in internal sales in local currencies for North America actually reflects a 4.2% growth when you normalize both for the impact of product switching between agency and direct sales as well as excluding sales of diagnostic products both in the current period and in the prior period due to changes of veterinary diagnostic manufacturing relationships.","Again, we believe that this normalized growth rate is more meaningful and a better reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business and will continue to show this normalized basis through the end of the year.","Our Medical sales were $597.2 million for the third quarter, and that's an increase of 24.3%. It consists of 25.0% growth in local currencies and a small decline of 0.7% related to foreign currency exchange. Overall, internal sales growth in local currencies was 13.6% and acquisitions contributed an additional 11.4%.","As I think most people know, the bulk of our Medical business is in North America, and that 13.6% internal growth was led by North America, which was 14.1% and that, again, was driven by large group practices and IDNs as well as a 1.3% growth internationally. This 14.1% growth in the North American Medical business was the highest level it's been in approximately eight years.","If we look at a component of our Medical sales, sales of seasonal influenza vaccines was $68.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 and that's up just a little bit of favorable timing. It's up 12% over last year. We sold about 6.6 million doses of flu vaccine during the third quarter, and through yesterday, we sold a total of nearly 7.7 million doses. So we expect the sales for the whole year somewhere between 9 million and 10 million doses, and we're well on our way to achieving that. If you exclude the impact of flu vaccine sales in both periods, the overall Medical sales growth increased 26.2% and 27% in constant currency.","Turning to Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $89.7 million in the quarter which is a 3.0% increase. This included 5.8% growth in constant currency and a 2.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales increased by 5.2% and acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.6%. That global 5.2% internal growth in constant currencies includes 4.5% growth in North America and 8.4% growth internationally.","If we turn to stock repurchase, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market during the third quarter. Specifically, we purchased approximately 261,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $144.11 which is just under $38 million of cash. This impact \u2013 the impact of this during the quarter was not material to our EPS. At the close of the quarter, we still have about $149 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock, and we remain committed to our goal of buying between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year.","If we take a brief look at some highlights from our balance sheet and cash flow, we had operating cash flow for the quarter of $107.4 million. That compares to $174 million last year. If you look at the details, the decrease was primarily driven by working capital and increases in accounts receivable and inventory, although we continue to believe we'll have strong operating cash flow for the year.","The day sales outstanding was favorable, 40.6 days in the current quarter versus 41.2 days last year. And inventory turns was slightly down to 5.7 turns versus 6 turns last year.","Finally, I'll just conclude with going through guidance for 2015 and 2016. I think it's important to remember that over the last two quarters, we noted on our past two conference calls that we expected to be at the low end of EPS guidance for the current year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange, and as I said, for the first nine months of 2015, foreign currency exchange translation had a negative impact again of approximately $0.20 on our EPS for the first nine months. So, because of that, we are now adjusting our EPS for the year to be in the range of $5.90 to $5.96, and that represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to the actual 2014 results.","The 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs which are expected to be between $0.26 and $0.30 per diluted share for the year, as well as the one-time $0.05 tax benefit that occurred in the third quarter. Also again, we now expect that these restructuring activities that were expected at the beginning of 2015 to be completed at the year will now \u2013 a portion of them will roll over into 2016. And we now expect restructuring costs in 2016 to be $0.03 to $0.07 per diluted share and should continue through the first half of 2016. As always, our 2015 EPS guidance is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include any impact for potential future acquisitions should they occur.","Turning to 2016 financial guidance, we're pleased to report that we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein should be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted guidance range. Again, the guidance for 2016 is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not included the impact of any potential future acquisitions and also does not include the impact of the restructuring cost of, again, approximately $0.03 to $0.07. We also \u2013 our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates remain relatively consistent with current levels.","So with that, I'd like to now to turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our four business groups with Dental group. In North America, we believe that consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies was in the 3.8% range and indicates continued solid patient flow to dental offices. Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 6.4% and was the highest in more than a year. I noted during our last quarter call that we expect the North American Dental sales and services growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, and these numbers bear that out.","We saw particular strength during the quarter in sales of what we internally call traditional equipment. Within International Dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies grew at 2.9% during the third quarter. International equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 5.3%. And this follows double-digit gains in the preceding quarter which was bolstered by the IDS, the International Dental Show (19:20).","Before we move on to our Animal Health financial performance, I would like to highlight an expansion of our dental operations in Italy. We just announced an agreement to make an investment in Dental Trey, a distributor of dental consumable merchandise and equipment with sales for 12 months ended June 30, 2015 of approximately \u20ac41 million. Dental Trey offers more than 33,000 branded products and a line of private-label products to dental practices in the region through a team of sales agents and an e-commerce Web portal.","Dental Trey also sells a proprietary dental practice management software system with an installed base of more than 1,200 dental offices. Dental Trey will complement our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relations. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2015. The acquisition is anticipated to be neutral to our 2016 diluted earnings per share and slightly accretive by less than 1% in 2017 and beyond.","Now, let me spend a few minutes on our Animal Health group. North America internal growth in local currencies was 4.2% on a normalized basis. Growth in our Animal Health group continues to reflect the benefits of strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we closed on our purchase of a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse A\/S. Kruuse had sales in 2014 of approximately $90 million, and this expanded our direct presence to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.","We also expect, and this is very important to introduce the Kruuse brand of products to additional markets and particularly through the Henry Schein businesses in the next year. So, this business is, of course, strategic from a geographic presence point of view, but also important because of the unique Kruuse brand of products.","We are very, very excited to \u2013 about the agreement that we announced a couple days ago to acquire an 80.1% interest in another company named Vetstreet. Vetstreet is a leading provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics to veterinary clinics and animal health manufacturers. Vetstreet offers veterinary clinics a suite of products and services that address key issues including communicating with pet owners once they leave the clinic and the lack of compliance with wellness visits and prescription regimen.","When this transaction closes early next year, Vetstreet will be a meaningful complement to our U.S. animal health businesses, and in particular, our practice management software installed base, which is in about half the veterinarians of this country, and will expand our practice marketing and client communication solutions, provide tools for better enhancement of our supplier relations, and connect us to veterinary clinics that are not current customers of Henry Schein Animal Health. The transaction, which is expected to close in early 2016, is anticipated to be neutral to 2016 diluted earnings per share and add $0.01 to $0.02 of accretion in 2017 and beyond.","On the Medical side, we had also a very exciting quarter. Internal sales growth for our Medical group in North America was 14.1%, an eight-year high as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs, Integrated Delivery Networks. This internal growth was bolstered by sales from our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. We are delighted with the continued successful transition of customers to the Henry Schein platform.","The combination of internal growth, plus the contribution from the Cardinal Health agreement, resulted in 26% growth in North America for the quarter versus the prior year. The integration of the strategic agreement into Henry Schein is substantially complete with many components to be integrated during the current fourth quarter. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers with our strategic agreements with Cardinal Health by being uniquely positioned to directly serve the entire continuum of healthcare.","Let me conclude with a short overview of our Technology and Value-Added segments. Internal sales growth in North America was 4.5% in local currencies, and international internal growth was 8.4% in local currencies with particular strength during the quarter in the Electronic Services and Value-Added Services arena.","Henry Schein is committed to the efficient delivery of healthcare services (24:53) business successes of our customers. The advanced technology process and services we offer provide a platform for our sales opportunities across all of our businesses.","So before we open the call to questions, I'd like to highlight some recent recognitions and initiatives. As you may know, Henry Schein is committed to expanding access to care for the underserved throughout the world and to increasing diversity and cultural competency within healthcare profession, each of the professions we serve for that matter.","In August, we announced the creation of the Henry Schein Cares Medal, which will honor organizations whose work has been especially effective in bringing care to those in need. At a gala event next year, we will be awarding medals to organizations from the fields of oral health, animal health, and Medical health.","And also in August, Henry Schein was awarded the Corporate Award by the Hispanic Dental Association. We received this in recognition for our decades of supporting initiatives to increase diversity and cultural competency in the dental profession for the U.S. and global Hispanic communities, as well as for our commitment to promoting access to care, and of course, healthcare equity worldwide.","The Henry Schein Global Cares corporate responsibility program was active during the third quarter. We launched our 2015 Healthy Lifestyles, Healthy Communities program, which this year expects to serve approximately 8,700 children and their caregivers throughout the United States with free Medical and dental services at 14 health fair events.","We, again, partnered with Integral (sic) [Integrated] (26:39) Medical Foundation and the Large Urology Group Practice Association to help raise awareness nationwide about the importance of prostate cancer screenings, and we helped more than 5,000 children return to the classroom ready to succeed though our 18th Annual Back-to-School program.","We also launched our newest initiative with an organization called Canine Companions for Independence, under which our Puppy Raiser Care Package are being delivered to veterinarians for their customers who volunteer to raise assistance dogs for people with physical disabilities.","On the academic side, we recently announced the partnership with the American College of Prosthodontists Education Foundation along with other dental partners to develop a new CAD\/CAM technology curriculum for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral programs. This curriculum is expected to be piloted by several dental schools beginning in 2017. We believe that CAD\/CAM technology enhances dentistry, and we want to make sure that dental students are appropriately trained so they can improve practice efficiencies and ensure better patient outcomes.","We are excited to be part of ensuring that the coming generation of dental professionals has the training required to derive the benefits that digital technology has to offer their patients. So, you will see Henry Schein has been successful in advancing our strategies by advancing the needs of our suppliers, our customers, our team, our investors and society in general, and it's the interplay between these five constituents that at the end of the day has provided Henry Schein with the opportunity to provide consistent earnings as we enter our 21st year as a public company.","Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of Henry Schein's IPO, and I think it is fair to say that our shareholders should be pleased with the consistent delivery of results, both in terms of earnings per share and in terms of taking those earnings per share and turning them into cash. This was the direct result of the balancing of these five constituents.","So, with that overview of the quarterly financial operating performance, Steve and I are pleased to take questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions, Stan and Steve. Really impressive internal growth in Medical this quarter. Anything worth calling out as far as the drivers of that over 14% internal growth? I mean, looking back several years, I'm not sure we've seen this level of growth on the internal North American side. I just wanted to, I guess within that, also make sure that all of Cardinal would be accounted for in the acquisition-related growth.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, that's a very good question. And I think you've probably noticed that perhaps in the last five or six years, our Medical business has gained momentum. This has been the result of a strategic planning exercise we concluded about seven years ago, in which we determined that there were two areas we wanted to focus on. One is the larger practices in the networks and what has morphed into what many refer to as the IDNs, integrated delivery networks and at the same time, focusing on certain specialty areas that are important to our position. (30:29)","All eventually geared towards wellness and prevention, which falls in line with the healthcare reform plans. In other words, wellness, healthcare versus sick care, moving procedures from the hospital to the office, to the alternate care side.","Our strategies are solid. We believe they are solid for many years to come. And we believe our Medical group has been executing very well. Of course, the acquisition of the Cardinal physician business and the integration of those sales representatives, including adding the Cardinal product offering to our Henry Schein offering, have all contributed in one way or another to driving, first, the internal growth and, in addition, of course, the acquisition growth that came along with that acquisition.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","And, Bob, just the second part of your question, so clearly, we show all of the Cardinal sales that came over to the Schein platform, both sales that were processed through the Cardinal platform as well as the sales now being processed through the Henry Schein platform. All of that is shown as acquisition growth.","So you could see there's also a significant acquisition growth in Medical and virtually \u2013 I think it's all related to the Cardinal acquisition of the physician business. So, we're able to track customer by customer and have a good split on that.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Yeah. No, both sides were actually really strong. Thanks for that. And I guess just to follow up, Steve, you mentioned that you're working through the restructuring initiatives. I guess just in that context, how should we think about the operating margin expansion next year relative to your goal of 20 basis points of same-store margin expansion per year?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","So, I think the goal is to at least achieve that 20 basis points. There's potential maybe to be a little bit ahead of that, depending on sales growth. And obviously the more sales growth that we get, if the markets continue to be solid for us, that allows us to leverage expenses to a greater extent. So, we feel good about the continued ability to expand margins into next year and even beyond.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first off, I wanted to go to the Animal Health business. Steve, appreciated the comments on the normalizing for the agency direct sales switch. I guess how much did that affect the growth this quarter, and when do you think we'll see that come to an end?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","You're talking about just the agency because there's two components to normalization, Kevin. The first is the shift away from the IDEXX sales product line to Abaxis and Heska, and we take out both prior year the IDEXX sales as well as current year the Abaxis and Heska sales to really show, excluding all diagnostic product categories, what the growth is. That ends in Q4 of this year.","Separately, the agency sales switch was a negative impact of just under 3% for us in the current quarter. It's hard to tell if there's future switches between agencies and direct sales. We really can't predict that, but \u2013 so it's not something I could say is going to end or not because there seems to be every year a flip-flop from one manufacturer, from one to the other. But we'll continue to call it out because I do think the best way of looking at our real growth is adjusting the impact of agency sales conversions for ourselves.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Sure. And then, Steve, can you provide any color as to what products or what type of products were switched to agency this quarter?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","It's in the pharma category, but I don't know the exact products, quite frankly, off the top of my head.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Then lastly, on the diagnostic switch to Abaxis and Heska, any color as to how that's going and which manufacturer seems to be getting more traction with the customers?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Sure, I'll start and Stanley will jump in. So we continue to be very optimistic about the ability to drive sales for both product lines, Heska and Abaxis. And one thing \u2013 maybe I'll turn it to Stanley to talk a little bit about, we have launched the new software, Axis-Q, and maybe that's a good place, Stanley, for you to jump in.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steven. We are actually quite pleased with the progress we are making on our diagnostic portfolio offering, and in fact, training of our sales force to introduce these products. As you may recall, the switch from one manufacturer to this group of manufacturers came quite sudden. We will focus on a lot of other things at the time and reliance on that manufacturer.","So about a year ago, we had to put our plans into place. Our plans contemplated adding software, middleware, that would connect various manufacturers' systems to our software, our practice management software. And about half the physicians in this country use our practice management software and a fair number overseas use our practice management software.","So, we developed this middleware, Axis-Q which is pretty good. It's up and running, it's out of beta, and we're selling. Of course, our sales force needs to be trained and understand how the interface between the actual (36:29) and there was a wide variety of boxes and systems out there. There's no shortage of good technology out there. How we can connect that in the most effective way to our customers, practice management system, also tying in reference labs to our practice management system.","And all of these, together with our acquisition of scil, which is a leading provider of laboratory diagnostic equipment software, is working actually quite well. And we're pleased, given the short amount of time that we've had to focus on this, with the results.","Now if you add the acquisition of Vetstreet to that, you will see that we are in a pretty good position to provide very good information to our customers to help them go out into their customer base to ensure that they are attracting traffic into the practitioner's office and provide solid data to those manufacturers that wish to work with us on the pet food side and on the pharma side. So, we're all very pleased with where we are considering what happened about a year ago. And I'm quite sure as has been the case several times in Henry Schein's history where a similar situation has emerged that Henry Schein will thrive. And we will, in fact, be a significant provider of diagnostic equipment to veterinarians throughout the world.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks, Stan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. And good morning, guys. Maybe the first one in \u2013 I hope I have the numbers right. Steven, for you, just when I look at the updated 2015 guidance, obviously, relative to our numbers, 3Q was a big bee (38:24). I'm just having a hard time sort of tying out to the 4Q EPS number. In other words, I sort of have my out margins flattish year-over-year or adjusted out margins flattish year-over-year. After you experienced some really good expansion in the first three quarters of the year and you've got the restructuring going on. So, maybe you can help reconcile that, am I too high or internal? Do I have the numbers right? Any thoughts there would be very helpful.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I don't want to get in to that level of specificity with specific margins for a quarter. But let me try to help you in a different way. So, there were a number of items, and I'll go to a couple of them, that were timing impacts, that were favorable timing in Q3, that reversed obviously in Q4. They include things like flu vaccines year-over-year. Flu vaccine sales were much stronger, up 12% Q3 this year versus last year. And as you know, flu vaccine is a good margin product for us.","There's also timing of a number of expenses that we expected to hit and typically hit in Q3 that are now expected to hit in Q4. And if you add all those together, you may have $0.03, $0.04 or $0.05 of timing variances between Q3 and Q4. So while that reduces a little bit of the growth in Q3, obviously it has the opposite impact in Q4. And when you do that, I think you'll be able to understand really more of the flow of our second half of the year. So hopefully that's helpful.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. It certainly it was. And just one more question that may have two different parts. I guess the international dental results, Stanley, were very solid and it seems like consumables and equipment is both now moving in the right direction. Just on a high level, can you give us some commentary there? I know, you've had some ebbs and flows, but are you seeing the strengthening, I guess, broadening out in several countries? And how do feel just about the consistency going forward in international dental?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the international dental business is solid. Of course, you have to adjust for foreign exchange because our results are post (40:37) U.S. dollars are not reflective of the dynamics, the positive dynamics that we're experiencing.","I would say, the German market which is our biggest market is solid. In equipment, we're having a very good year. I don't see why we shouldn't continue with that trend for a while. Consumables are steady. The UK is a good market. I think we're doing okay there. France is a bit weak, but we are doing okay because we're really the only national full-service dealer distributor in the UK.","And then if you look at Italy and Spain, we're doing okay, but the comparables are pretty low. And then the only other big market is Australia where there are \u2013 we're doing okay, we're getting some market share, but the Australian economy is not doing as well as it was maybe because of commodities. But I think it seems to be bit of a lackluster economy at this moment. It could turn around quickly. The rest of the markets in aggregate are not that material. So, we remain quite positive about international in general. Also, I might add (41:46) and we'll continue to invest in the global dental market.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you provide me with a little bit more color around the growth in dental equipment sales in North America? It looked like a very healthy growth rate especially relative to last quarter.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's something that \u2013 if you recall last quarter, we did say that we did expect to see an acceleration of equipment sales growth. So we're pleased that that happened. If you look at overall, just to give you a little bit of color, traditional equipment sales growth for the quarter was a bit stronger than high tech equipment but not much, probably somewhere in total of about 1 percentage point differential. So really good growth both on the overall high tech equipment category as well as the overall traditional equipment category, so not major variance but slightly better traditional equipment growth than high tech growth.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up on IDEXX Labs, was that \u2013 how much of a headwind was that in 2015 in terms of revenue and have you sort of fully worked through that and filled that bucket? Thanks.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Yes. So, the IDEXX revenue in the prior year for 2014 was about $150 million of revenue. And we said we would not be back even on revenues in year one it would probably be at least a couple of years maybe into the third year for us to be even. It is a longer sales cycle to convert people.","Not all veterinarians are eligible for conversion in the same year because of long-term commitments. So, it is a multi-year project. So, we're still negative on overall diagnostic sales. But again, long term, we feel, as Stanley talked about it in the previous question, optimistic about being successful in that category.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. So, I mean, if you did $150 million in revenue in 2014, did that convert to, like, say, $50 million in 2015 and then will increase to, like, $100 million in 2016?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I don't want to make those type of projections at this time as to how much it is. I think it's too much specificity. We typically don't give that level of detail on a specific product line. But it's going to take two or three years really to get back to even on the sales line. By the way, on the profit line, depending on how things work, we may not need the same amount of sales to achieve the same level of profitability because there may be higher margin.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Congrats on a good quarter.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Evercore ISI.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys, and thanks for all the details so far. I just wanted to dive back in a little bit, to one of the earlier questions \u2013 I believe it was from Bob \u2013 on the Medical business. Stanley, you did a great job talking about the strategic plan you had put in place in terms of repositioning your sales structure.","That being said, the last five quarters, if my math is correctly on local currency, internally generated revenue has really started to see the inflection point. Is there anything else you can point to \u2013 is some of this related to ACH-driven utilization? Obviously, you talked about Cardinal and to the benefits there. (45:32) I'm just trying to get through the pieces, because the step-up has been pretty meaningful and especially against the backdrop of what I would say is less enthusiastic overall utilization metrics. And so I'm just trying to see how you guys are doing so much better than what the rest of the market appears to be doing.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a very good question, and obviously, there's no solid data out there. There are a couple of factors. First of all, there is definitely a movement from the acute care setting to the alternate care setting, both in terms of physician practices, and I'm talking about GPs, although in some areas, the specialists, too, and the ambulatory care centers. So that's a fact, specific data, hard to get, but I think it's fair to say.","I think as the Affordable Care Act kicks in, there'll be more people covered with the ability to go to a GP for a check-up or when they're feeling a flu or something rather than wait until they're really sick to go to the emergency center at a hospital where people who do not have insurance would have been treated.","I'm not dealing with the very low-end, which is Medicaid nor with the Medicare or those that are covered by insurance. But there're still, I don't know, 50 million, 60 million, 70 million people that in one way or another now will have some form of insurance, not fully kicked in, but GPs in general are seeing more patients.","They're not getting reimbursed by the way at the same rate per patient that they were before. But they need a glove and they need a mask, and they need cleansing solutions.","I would also add that there are not that many national distributors that can provide a complete solution to the alternate care setting. I happen to think we do it better than anyone else, but I'm sure others will say they do it well. So, we all gain name recognition with the GPOs. And the GPOs realize that if the contract is put through Schein, they're not going to look too bad because we're going to execute well.","And I think we execute extremely well to these large accounts, multiple locations under common management. So, it's a little bit of trend and it's a lot of execution. And I think we have good momentum in this marketplace. A lot of brand recognition that perhaps we didn't have six or seven years ago amongst these large providers because six or seven years ago, we were known to the doctors, the person that managed the practice rather than to the large group practice or the hospital or the IDN that is now our customer.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Stanley. And then just, Steve, one quick technical question for you. The euro has been all over the place over the last year. Obviously, you talked about the headwinds you had related to EPS over the course of the year. I believe you said, currency was roughly in line, at least the expectation for next year, call it, $1.10 or so. Do you pursue any hedging? Is there any thoughts, given the volatility over the last 12 months, 18 months, to do any hedging on the euro?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","We actually took another look at it, given the volatility, and we continue to elect not to hedge translation adjustments. Really, it's not an economic hedge. Really, if you want to hedge for a long-term period is expensive and you're just delaying the impact until when the hedge runs out.","We do hedge though transaction exposure. So, in countries where we're buying in currency A and selling in currency B, we're continuing to hedge. We actually increased the amount of hedges we do on transactions. We were typically hedging 70% plus of known activity. We're probably closer to 90% today. But we really feel that the translation exposure is something that we don't want to do. And quite frankly, I think that the volatility and being able to predict movements is difficult, if not impossible.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Understood. If I could sneak in one last question, I apologize for this. Is there an extra week next year included in the guidance?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, it's a good point. Yes, we have our 53rd week in 2016. I'm glad you asked the question. So, it's interesting because depending on the business unit, the level of incremental profitability in some cases is modest, in some cases is actually slightly negative. And that may sound odd, right, because you may say, how do you have an extra week and not have more profitability? But if you think it through, it's the last week of the year which is the holiday week.","So, when you look at sales on Consumables, sales tend be very light that week because a lot of offices are closed and there's not a lot of ordering going on that week. Equipment is a little different story. But at least on Consumables, it's a very light week. And a lot of expenses, and if you think of payroll and payroll-related that represents at least two-thirds of our expense structure, you have a full week's worth of payroll and a partial week's worth of sales. So, everyone thinks the extra week is very profitable for us. It really is marginally plus or minus depending on the business unit.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","No, that's perfect, and thanks for the color. I really appreciate it.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Can you (51:22-51:29) percent growth in U.S. and...","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","John, sorry to interrupt you, but you \u2013 the beginning of your question was not \u2013 we weren't able to hear, so maybe you could just repeat it again.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sure. Sorry about that. If you think about your U.S. dental consumable growth rate of 3.8%, just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on any trends you might be seeing underneath that, for example, growth in the sort of specialty procedures like implants versus the more GP-oriented procedures. And related to that, are you starting to see any increasing shift of some of the more specialty procedures into the general dentist office or not really?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, John, I don't think this quarter would be an indication of trends per se. Having said that, I do believe that more procedures are moving into the GP office, and that's why, by the way, we entered the endodontic space, the orthodontic space and the implant oral surgery space in such a heavy way several years ago because our GP customers are performing these procedures.","So, I think that is correct. I don't think any particular results that we may have may be indicative of the change. If we're growing faster in the specialty area, the reason is probably because we're underpenetrated.","So, I would say in our numbers, there's nothing that can indicate one way or the other, although, obviously, there's a movement from the small accounts to the midsized accounts and from the midsized accounts to the elite, the large ones although we are experiencing I think the heaviest growth in the midmarket accounts, those are practitioners that own a multiple of practices, three, four practices.","Yeah. And just on the pure metrics for the current quarter, our overall specialty product category did grow a little bit faster than the overall 3.8%, John. So that's part of our strategy and why we got into those product categories because we do expect them to grow at a faster clip. It wasn't a huge gap this quarter but again this is only one quarter and it was slightly faster.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And just one last one, Steve. Did the price component of the 3.8% change at all versus what you've seen in earlier quarters?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","No. I would say that pricing inflation for the year has been very stable. I don't think there's been any major movements.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","And we have time for one final question and your last question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Steve, I want to go back to one of your comments just on the dental equipment side. You talked about the strength in basic equipment. On the technology side, that side has been a little weaker this year. I know you've had some tough comps throughout the year from last year with PlanScan and what have you. But can you talk about maybe in the context of those tough comps, end markets, maybe some of the innovation where your suppliers are, maybe on Intraoral and that probably a little bit behind there? But just kind of what is it going to take to get some of the technology side of the equipment business on the dental side growing here again?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Well, you know, Jeff, mid-single-digit growth on technology is not a bad place for the current quarter. We are seeing on CAD\/CAM a bigger increase in people electing at this time to just buy the scan-only product and not the full system. I'm sure you know we sell a few different brands on scan-only and sometimes that makes sense. I think that's ultimately the practice, I think we'll go for the full end-to-end solution. But sometimes, they just want to get started. And so, we're seeing a lot more people doing scan-only than we've seen historically.","We did have a difficult comp with upgrades and very strong sales last year in the CAD\/CAM segment. But I still think if you look out a few quarters, this is going to be a very strong category. There's still very good technology. There's still very low penetration in the market. It's something that dentists really will adopt over a period of time. And again, we all know dentists are a little slower adopters of technology than other practitioners may be. But I think we should stay very bullish on this category.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. That's helpful.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would add, Jeff, that the rates of automation in the dental laboratories is accelerating a lot. And as the largest provider of products to dental labs, we're experiencing good growth in those three large business segments (56:40). So, the whole area of CAD\/CAM and automation of laboratories is very, very exciting for us. And the connection between those labs and our customers through our Commit (56:54) dental program is very, very exciting.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Understood. Thanks. And then, just maybe two very quick clarifying questions. Steve, repurchases in the quarter down under $40 million, second quarter in a row, you've been kind of trending in the mid-70s for a number of quarters, just why especially with the stock having pulled in in I guess during the quarter, why the repurchases may be lower two quarters in a row, and then any comments at all on timing of the dental consumables business throughout 3Q. One of your suppliers talked about maybe entering the quarter a little stronger than they exited, but just anything you were seeing from a timing standpoint would be helpful. Thank you.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","Sure. Yeah. In hindsight, I wish we were a little bit more aggressive in Q2 and Q3 in stock repurchase, but we'll still probably \u2013 will use the bulk of the $150 million that is approved before the year-end or slightly into next year. I'm not sure if there's any better answer to that, Jeff.","On Q3 on the dental side, I think I would concur that the quarter, but don't be too much into this. The quarter was stronger at the beginning of the quarter than the end of the quarter, but many, many times, you see those variations and they really are just the ebbs and flow of purchasing patterns of practices and of the timing things and they're not indicative of really any trend, but I do agree that it started stronger for Q3 than the final month of the quarter.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, everybody, for calling in. I'm very pleased with the progress of the business. In each of our businesses we're gaining market share, we are executing on our strategies and are very excited about the future of the business.","Thank you for calling in. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Carolynne Borders at 631-390-8105 or Steve Paladino at 631-843-5915, and look forward to speaking with you I think, in four months, right?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive Vice President","A little bit longer for the year-end, yes.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much and have a good holiday too everyone. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude Henry Schein's third quarter conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the second quarter of 2014. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking.

As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.

Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. (Operator Instructions)","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our sales for the second quarter was solid as we posted broad based gains on a global basis. In fact, internal sales growth in local currencies of 4.3% was the highest we have reported since the fourth quarter of 2012.","Our domestic sales rebounded from the effects of the severe winter weather in the preceding quarter. And also this is the quarter that should be compared to the IDS sales of 2013, which was a very good quarter from a Dental equipment and specifically an International Dental equipment growth point of view.","Having achieved year -to-date diluted EPS ahead of our expectations, we are also pleased to be raising the lower end of 2014 financial guidance range by $0.04. So overall we are pleased with our performance in the quarter, a steady growth in market share in all of our business units, and we'll provide further comments as the call goes on.","So, let me start by asking Steven to provide comments on the financial results, and then I'll come back with some comments on the business in general. Thank you.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2014. As we begin, I'd like to point out that in 2014 both Easter and Passover holidays occurred in the second quarter, whereas in 2013 they both fell in the first quarter.","The Easter holiday in particular has a more pronounced effect in certain international markets resulting in one less selling day because Good Friday is a national holiday in Canada and many European countries.","So, now turning to our Q2 results, our net sales for the quarter ended June 28, 2014, were $2.6 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared with the second quarter of 2013. This consisted of 7.9% growth in local currencies and 1.4% growth related to foreign currency exchange.","In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 4.3% and acquisition growth contributed 3.6%. You can see the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued this morning.","Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2014 was 6.9%, that's a decline of 45 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2013. When excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, our operating margin contracted by 27 basis points, and that 27-basis-point contraction includes an improvement in operating expenses as a percent of sales of 32 basis points, offset by a contraction in gross margin of 59 basis points. The gross margin decline is primarily related to changes in sales mix in our businesses across all of our four groups of businesses.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8%, which is down from 31.4% in the second quarter of 2013 and is in line with the guidance that we previously gave. The lower tax rate is due to continued implementation of tax planning strategies and also higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rate. We expect the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the 30% to 31% range.","Net income attributable to Henry Schein for the second quarter of 2014 was $116.2 million or $1.35 per diluted share. This represents growth of 7.2% and 9.8% respectively, compared with the second quarter of 2013.","Our foreign currency exchange did not have any material impact on our EPS for the quarter.","Let me provide some detail for our sales results for the second quarter. Dental sales for the second quarter of 2014 increased 8.6% to $1.4 billion. This 8.6% growth consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and 1.1% gain related to foreign currency exchange.","If you look at local currencies, internally generated locally currency sales growth was 2.6% and acquisition growth contributed 4.9%, and that's primarily related to both BioHorizons and Arseus acquisitions that were completed.","The 2.6% internal growth in local currencies consisted of 4.3% growth in North America, while international sales were flat. If you look at some detail behind each of North American International, the 4.3% internal growth in local currencies in North America included 2.5% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 10.8% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue.","The internal international growth in local currencies included 2.1% growth in consumable merchandize, but a decline in equipment sales and service revenue of 5.5%. That's again due to the timing of the biennial IDS trade show in Germany, which made for a difficult comparison in the prior year as well as some impact of the Easter and Passover holidays.","If we look at Animal Health sales, there were $754.5 million in the second quarter, an increase of 13.2%, that included growth of 10.7% in local currencies and 2.5% related to foreign currency.","Our internal sales growth and local currencies were 7.3% and acquisitions contributed an additional 3.4%. If we look at the component of that 7.3% internal growth in local currencies, it included 7.9% growth in North America and 6.8% growth internationally.","If you also normalize for the impact of business switching from agency sales to standard or normal sales, our North American sales growth was 5.6%.","Medical sales were $403.3 million in the second quarter, an increase of 4.0%, and that is represented by 3.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.3% growth related to foreign currency.","The 3.7% internal growth in local currencies included 3.9% in North America and a slight decline of 1.4% International. We remain confident that our strategy of focusing on large group practices continue to result in market share growth this quarter in the Medical segment.","Turning to Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $89.1 million in the quarter, an increase of 14.2%, and this included 13.2% growth in local currencies and an additional 1.0% growth related to foreign currency.","The local currency internally generated sales increased by 9.3% and acquisition growth was 3.9%. The 9.3% growth internally included 8.5% in North America growth and 14.4% growth in international.","If you again normalize for sales results to account for a switch to agency sales, our internal growth in local currencies was 14.4% in the technology business. We're really very pleased with that double-digit normalized sales growth in the Technology and Value-Added Services businesses, and we had strong growth also in financial services sub-segment of that category.","Related to stock repurchase, we continue to repurchase our common stock in the open market during the second quarter. Specifically, we repurchased 654,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $116.43, or about $76 million. The impact of this repurchase on the second quarter diluted EPS was not material. And we continue to have money authorized for future repurchases. At the close of the second quarter, we had $148 million authorized and available for future repurchases and we remain committed to our goal of continuing to repurchase and to repurchase somewhere between $200 and $300 million of our stock for the full year.","If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet, operating cash flow for the quarter was $199.2 million that compares to $274.8 million in 2013 second quarter. We believe our full year operating cash flow will continue to be strong.","Some components, accounts receivable days sales outstanding was about 40.2 days compared to 39.5 days last year and inventory returns was 6.0 turns compared to 6.2 turns last year.","I'll conclude my remarks by discussing our 2014 financial guidance. For 2014, we now expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $5.33 to $5.39, and as Stanley said earlier this represents a $0.04 increase in the low-end of our range and our guidance now reflects growth of 8% to 9% compared with 2013 results, when you exclude that onetime item in 2013 and that again compares with our previously issued guidance of 5.29 to 5.39.","As always our current year guidance is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any potential new acquisitions.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of business groups with the Dental group. We gained market share in our Dental group with total U.S. dollar growth in North America exceeding 8% and above 9% internationally.","North America internal merchandize sales growth was bolstered by strategic acquisitions and equipment sales of service revenue growth in local currency was quite good, was nearly 11%.","While sales of traditional equipment was strong, growth was even stronger in the high-tech equipment arena and was led by our PlanScan\/E4D CAD\/CAM product.","International Dental growth also reflects a strategic acquisitions while internal equipment sales and service revenue in local currency declined by few percentage point from a stronger play comparison that of course was driven by the biennial IDS show in Congress and Germany as Steven mentioned earlier on.","During the quarter, we entered into the Brazilian Dental market by a 50% ownership investment in Dental Speed Graph. This is our first operation in South America and bring a number of countries where Henry Schein has operations affiliates on the ground to 27%.","Dental Speed Graph is the largest direct marketing provider of Dental consumable merchandize in Brazil with a robust e-commerce platform, 2013 sales of approximately $28 million. Dental Speed Graph has 170 team members and approximately 55, 000 customers in Brazil.","We have long sort to establish a presence in Brazil which is Latin America's largest economy and the seventh largest economy in the world. Brazil has an estimate 150,000 [assistant] (ph) dentist who serve a market, whose growth is being filled by aging population and extending middle class. That is also a keen awareness in Brazil of the importance of ROK and we're very, very excited about our entry into the Brazilian market and a quite optimistic about opportunities in Brazil in general.","During the quarter we also completed a notable Dental transaction in Europe. In early June we acquired Sirona Direct which is the Dental distribution business of Serino Dental Systems in France. Sirona Direct is exclusive distributor of Dental equipment for Serino Dental Systems in Paris and Normandy, and has annual sales of approximately $14 million.","We also entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Serino for the promotion and distribution of the full line of Dental equipment to practitioners in most of France including of the CEREC CAD\/CAM system.","We finished it by thus other businesses in France with the exclusive regional distribution agreements of products manufacturing in Barcelona. Today, Henry Schein is established as Serino's exclusive distributor to practitioner across most of the France which is one of the largest European markets for Dental products, approximately 36,000 dentists serving a population of almost 66 million people.","We are committed to providing the French Dental community as we are throughout the world actually with the comprehensive offering to meet all of its practise needs. Serino's innovative products are an important part of our connected Dental platform which is designed to bring the latest digital Dental solutions to practitioners we serve in this quickly changing Dental marketplace.","Very pleased that we now have a rounded offering throughout the French market and this is a market that's been good for Henry Schein for well over a decade and half, very, very exciting.","Now on the Animal Health side. We also gained market share in this group in the quarter with internal sales growth in local currencies at its highest level in six quarters. There was a late start to the parasiticide season in the U.S. this year. Of course we know this was in winter but domestic sales growth returned to normal in the second quarter.","On the international front, internal Animal debt sales growth in local currencies was at a multi record high.","We also significantly strengthened our position in the U.S. acquiring products and market with the acquisitions of approximately 60% ownership in SmartPak which is completed early in the third quarter.","SmartPak is the leading domestic provided equine supplements and horse suppliers with sales of 2013 of approximately $105 million and 325 team members [indiscernible].","A really fantastic company, a lot of energy, a lot of sales activity and of course the market leader in its segment. The primary product is patented SmartPak supplement feeding system which provides equine supplements in customized ready dose packaging. The company offers more than 250 branded equine supplements including its proprietary smart supplements brand.","SmartPak also offers a broad range of equestrian supplies and accessories, like a power and lighting equipment, pharmaceutical and other equine and canine focused products.","We are fortunate to have acquired a majority ownership position in this fast growing company with a deep-deep commitment to equine health and a keen expertise in sales and unique expertise in the digital marketing arena too.","So that's the wholesales and digital marketing arena, plus the equine offering that makes us feel excited about those business which has a fantastic management team and organization in general.","In fact, SmartPak is a leading company in this e-commerce environment. SmartPak at Henry Schein share a strong commitment to supporting Animal nutrition and raising awareness of nutrition's, viral impact on overall horse health.","Let me now turn to our Medical business. North America as I think most of our shareholders know represents 95% of the total medical growth, - of total medical sales group \u2013 medical group sales.","Sales growth accelerated sharply from the preceding quarter as we have current impacted weather, and more importantly made progress with our strategic focus on large group practises and IDN, Integrated Delivery Networks.","Looking to the upcoming flu season, I'm pleased to report that pre-booking of seasonal influenza vaccines are running in-line with the prior year. We do expect to distribute 8 million to 9 million doses in the upcoming flu season.","During the second quarter we announced its strategic agreement with Athenahealth. Together our two companies will help physicians operate efficient, successful practises, as well as course at using technology and other consultative service to provide high quality care through the delivery and use of athenaOne suite of services.","These services include electronic health records, integrated revenue cycle management and patient communication. We will jointly market the services to Henry Schein's customers as part of our health connect offering, which helps physicians advance the digitalization of the practises.","We are extremely committed to being a trusted advisor to our medical customers. And to help its practitioners operate successful practices distinguished by improved patient outcomes and patient efficiency.","On a forward looking open, cloud-based platform is a great compliment \u2013 our platform is a great compliment to many technological driven solutions we currently offer. So, the arrangement with Athena in the end takes our Henry Schein know-how connections with our customers and compliments that with this arrangement we now have with Athena, we believe the leading provider of these kinds of services to the physician practice.","We are very pleased with the progress in our Medical business, specifically the progress we are making with large group practices and the regular gaining recognition we are experiencing amongst IDNs and very, very excited as we move as a company forward in this arena.","Now, let me conclude my business overview with the Technology and Value-Added Services. Sales growth accelerated in North America compared with the preceding quarter due to its highest level in more than a year, with particular strength in software sales and financial services.","Very pleased with this Group. Of course this is a very profitable Group but more importantly our Technology and Value-Added services group provides enormous stickiness to our customers and is the key way in which we provide consultative services supporting in related technology and so to provide a lot of advice and value-added services to compliment our trusted advisor status within the practice.","We continue also by the way to be very pleased with the performance of internationally group with double-digit internal in local currencies for the past six quarters.","So, we'll open the call to questions in a minute. Let me just share two recent corporate developments with you here today. First the 2014 Fortune 500 ranking of America's largest corporation has recently been issued.","Henry Schein is now number 292 on the list up from 296 in last year's ranking. To climb two spots on the Fortune 500 list in less than a decade, - 200 spots in the Fortune 500 list in less than a decade of course and remembering the markets that we serve are not the huge consumer markets et cetera but the office base practitioner market.","So to climb this 200 spots on the Fortune 500 list in less than a decade is testament to Henry Schein's and team Schein's hard work. And to our success implementing a strategic plan that focuses on many customer needs to value added products and services in new technology coupled with our terrific culture and values in the company, putting this all those together leading in the end creates the momentum that has resulted in Henry Schein having such a good track record.","By the way, this marks our 75th call as a public company and we are very pleased and proud of our track record. And let me take this opportunity to thank all of team Schein, and our Board for the tremendous support to our shareholders as well over the last 75 quarters.","So let me also now just give you an update on our Board. In early June, we announced Dr. Dianne Rekow was elected to the Henry Schein Board of Directors. We are truly fortunate to have Dianne Rekow joined us as Director. Of course she is a prominent Dean, quite active in the Dental academic and clinical environment.","But it was Dianne Rekow who played a key role in pioneering, key pioneering role in the field of Digital Dentistry. An expert in the development and performance of new materials and products were used in aesthetic and restorative dentistry and a global sought leader in Dental education.","Dianne Rekow is Dean of Kings College London Dental Institute and a Professor of Orthodontics. She previously was the professor of Orthodontics at NYU, - who was previously an Professor of Orthodontics NYU.","For more than a decade has experience in Management of Dental of educational institutes in general, commercial experience in previous position, so clearly Dr. Rekow brings a wealth of not only Dental experience but global Dental experience and general business experience to Henry Schein. Let me also take this opportunity to thank [indiscernible] for her service on the Henry Schein Board.","So, with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. And Steven and I are now ready to answer any questions which you may have.","Carolynne Borders","And [Julie], we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group","Hi, good morning, guys.","Stanley Bergman","Good morning.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group","So, I wanted to dig in a little bit -- obviously there was a release out last week from IDEX related to -- or the week before -- I guess their distribution agreement designed to go direct. You did quantify what you thought the impact would be from a -- specifically pulling that out of your arrangements, but as you think about planning to offset some of that with other items, how far in advance do you start to plan -- do you start the process of identifying partners you want to work with? And how far in advance can you start to actually move some of those additional products or replacement products through your channel?","Stanley Bergman","Thanks for your question. It's a very good question, and Henry Schein is committed and has been committed to providing a full array of products and related services to our customers in all three groups. This is not the first time at all where the manufacturer has decided to change distribution arrangements with us. We are extremely confident that we will not lose our market share in Animal Health globally.","We remain confident that we will provide an outstanding offering of products, in this case products means equipment and consumables and related software to our customers. And I think in the end, Henry Schein will be a much stronger company in the Animal Health space, and I'm quite sure that our customers will be pleased with the offering.","Obviously, I can't discuss today the exact plans we have, but you can remain sure we are comfortable that Henry Schein will have an outstanding offering of products for our Animal Health customers in this country and abroad.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group","Great. And then just one quick question on the CAD\/CAM development. As you think about the E4D rollout, obviously you had a very big launch with that product back at the New York Dental Show, at least in December. How -- when you go into these products, are they more replacements for offices that are already doing in-office CAD\/CAM, or is this you penetrating what would be more of a greenfield market?","Stanley Bergman","The market for digitalized industry is relatively underpenetrated. On a global basis, it's hard to get an exact number, but it's someway around the higher-single digits, maybe low-double digits, and it is our view and if one speaks to the experts in Dentistry that at some point within the next decade or so, this digital dentistry for prosthetics and the connection of the Dental office digitally to the Dental laboratory, this whole area will become standard of care.","There's a huge amount of activity going on here from software to different forms of devices, the scanner, various kinds of software, different milling solutions, both in-office, in the lab, as well as all sorts of materials.","So, this is a huge market, and one needs to look at the market not in terms of one device, one product, or a couple of devices put together or maybe even the case of chair side CAD\/CAM scanner, the software, the mold, but in a much broader sense.","And in that regard, we really are at the beginning of this digitalization of prosthetics. And so, we're very excited. We see a huge opportunity here, and I think you can expect to see lots of developments with many companies coming into this field on the chair side, but more importantly on the connectivity side, the implant side, the lab side, the milling of different kinds of prosthetics, customized prosthetics, it's a whole reinvention of Dentistry. Very excited. Henry Schein has been investing in this space for almost five to six years, and I'm not talking about just the chair side, but I'm talking about the whole reinvention of Dentistry through our global prosthetics group.","And so, the launch of one particular product, maybe the one you referred to, is not as important. It is important as a product but not as important as the overall trends, and we believe we are very well positioned across Dentistry to help Dentists understand the opportunities that are emerging in the digitalization of prosthetics and help them to find solution.","I think our role will be very, very similar to the role we played introducing the PC to Dentistry almost 18 years ago when we went to Dentists and suggested them that they put a PC in their office as there were at that time I think 800 different software companies, and together with the Dental community, the profession, we were able to create the leading brands in practice management software.","So, it's no different to that or the role that Henry Schein played in bringing infection control, reports of infection control to the Dentists in the late 80s.","Henry Schein, I think has a track record of helping Dentists' advance with the most important trends in Dentistry and [oral care] (ph). And I think, digitalization of prosthetics is no different. It's not a product situation, it's a whole solution and I think we are ideally positioned with our various businesses that we earn but more importantly with our talents of management in this arena to help practitioners understand the importance of digitalization of prosthetics and the way Henry Schein can help them.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group","Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","In fact, we have later this week, I think it's on Thursday or Friday, - Friday, we have the start of our Business of Dentistry conference in Vegas, which addresses just this point. And actually, tomorrow we have the opening of our new technology center in Utah, which is significantly devoted to helping practitioners understand the trends in Dentistry and helping them advance their practices taking advantage of these trends.","This is a whole exciting area and Henry Schein is investing heavily in terms of talent and businesses and stringing these businesses together in a very logical way.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Just wanted to transition over to the consumables business. It looks like it was soft in, particularly in North America. I was wondering if you guys could just give us a sense of how that business trended throughout the quarter, so April versus May versus June? And then just your thoughts on the health of dental demand in the back half of the year.","Stanley Bergman","I am not sure if one would view it soft per se , because there are lots of puts and takes. You see one number and overall I think we're gaining market share in the market. I'm not saying the market is robust, but as we have mentioned in several calls now over the last, four, five, six calls, the Dental market is leading in a positive direction, there is some deflation over the few products on the commodity side. There is production of new products.","And overall I think the industry is okay. It's not the best it has been, but I would say it's leading in the positive direction and we believe we're gaining market share.","Remember, sales are not that you see are, not the traditional consumable number that a distributor maybe reporting on but it's a composite of our consumables, our equipment, our specialty product. So, it's a little bit more complex and I would say again that we believe that the market is leaning towards the positive growth on balance and that we're gaining market share.","As to the future, I can't really tell you exactly but we are contemplating that at this point in any event, that the GDP continuous to grow in a slightly positive way. And that Dentistry will follow the GDP in general and that Henry Schein will continue to gain market share and that's our view and that's the way we planned this year and for many years.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful.","Steven Paladino","Hey Bob, let me just add one other things if I could please, so. We did talk a little bit about sales rebounding in Q2 and just to quote some numbers for you because we really didn't see it.","If you look at the North American Dental consumable merchandise, Q1 was 0.8% growth and this is constant currency, local internal growth.","But Q2 rebounded to 2.5% and similarly in Animal Health where constant currency growth in Q1 was slightly negative, it rebounded to 7.9% in Q2 of which 5.6% is the normalized number and even in medical it rebounded from 2% in Q1 to 3.9%.","So, we really think that the overall market has normalized. We do think that sales growth trends as Stanley said, given the economy is continuing to improve. We're a bit optimistic that growth trends will continue but at a very gradual pace.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","No, that's actually helpful. And then Steve, actually if I could just ask you on the organic operating margin performance in the quarter, it looks like it was down about 60 basis points year-over-year. The trend hasn't been great there for a couple of quarters. Just was wondering if you could maybe share with us any sense by segment of where that margin pressures are actually coming from?","Steven Paladino","Sure. And I wouldn't really characterize it as margin pressure, but if you look at our report \u2013 I'm going to peel the onion, so starting with the reported. The reported operating margin was down 45 basis points year-over-year basis. The biggest contributor to that was acquisitions, which includes amortization and deal cost.","So, if your pull-out the acquisitions as well by the way to inventory step up at the BioHorizons. If you pull all of that out, that was the biggest contributor and contributed almost half of that margin decline.","The other components really are two things. One is, fastest growing businesses, the Animal Health business which was a fast growing also, is leaning as well as some other businesses leaning more towards corporate accounts. And as you know, they carry a little bit lower gross and operating margin. But still very nice profitability and returns on investment. That's a second contributor.","And the third is really in our Dental equipment business. Dental equipment sales carry a little bit lower gross margin than our core dental business. We had very strong E4D\/PlanScan sales growth. There was also some upgrades that occurred in that product category. But it's important to note, that even excluding the upgrades, PlanScan E4D was our fastest growing sub-category within Dental equipment.","So, there's a lot of moving parts but overall it's really \u2013 I wouldn't characterize it as pressure, it is more as sales mix within business units.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffrey","","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Steve, just wanted to follow up on that point. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the gross margin being affected by a change in sales mix. Was that really just the dental equipment and that mix shift in animal health growth or was there anything else that you guys saw this quarter affecting the gross margin?","Steven Paladino","No, there's a lot of moving parts but those are the only real significant ones, the rest were really smaller movements within our organic margin. So, the big ones were the two I just called out, yes.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffrey","","Okay, great. And then in the medical segment, just wondering if you guys have noticed any uptick in order growth or utilization from your customers. Are they seeing any volume increases from Medicaid expansion and healthcare reform yet?","Stanley Bergman","I don't think any major trends can be noticed. There are some accounts that are experiencing some additional traffic. Of course do believe and I've been saying this for a while now, that this is a longer trend and I think healthcare reform will in the long run have a positive impact on oral care.","But, I don't think we can say that, we experience significant across the Board increase in business because our customers are seeing more younger people at this stage. So, I don't think the public is aware of this, I don't think companies are fully aware of all the provisions which are just been made clear about the administration.","So, I do think this goes well for Dentistry in general and over time we will see more younger people going to see dentists. Of course dentist would experience some pressure on pricing per procedure, but that I think in the end will result in price pressure but more units.","And we, I think are well-positioned to help those customers deal with practicing, practice management, most dental practitioners can take advantage of Dentrix and Easy Dental and some of other consulting services to really operate more efficient practice. And at the same time increase the quality of care.","So, I think this gives us much more value to consulting one of our consultants in practice management and inevitably good for business model. But I don't think we can point to any specific immediate trends at this point other than there's a lot of buzz, I know that I'll be talking about it my address to the uses at our Business of Dentistry conference in Vegas and so this is something that is more and more important but it's not shifting any numbers in a material way at this point.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","","Great. And then just going back to Animal Health, other than the diagnostic change you will face in 2015, are you seeing any positive impact from the new products that have been launched this year, like Apoquel, the anti-itch medication for dogs? And then there were a couple of new oral flea and tick medications that had pretty strong demand.","Stanley Bergman","","There are so many products that are puts and takes in this Animal Health business. And for us to start commenting on any one item, I think the one of the products you mentioned, we don't see [added] (ph). But suffice this to say, the market in the parasiticide will start a little bit later this year. And we believe that we continue to gain market share. It's a good market for us.","Some of the high volume products are not necessarily the biggest money makers. Some of the slow moving, - some of the smaller products are very profitable. We have very good strategies in place to advance the profitability this market. The overall sales as well and gaining market share.","So, we remain very, very optimistic about our Animal Health business. We have a great global management team. I just actually on Thursday spent time with our team in Poland and our European management team, are more convinced than ever that we have a great, great team that will of course gain sales, market share and profitability for Henry Schein and some very good cash flow.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Glen Santangelo of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jeff Bailin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Morning. Thanks for the question. It's actually Jeff Bailin in for Glen. There has been a lot of discussion in the marketplace around one of the leading premium implant players potentially being for sale. I understand you are probably limited in your ability to discuss any specific properties, but given Henry Schein's investments in the lower and middle end of the implant market, could you just talk about whether a presence on the premium side of the implant market could ever make sense for you?","Stanley Bergman","Obviously we can't comment on this deal that's being touted around Wall Street or any other deal because if we do, that mean we'll have to comment on all sorts of things. So, our policy is generally not to comment on deals that have not been concluded. And so that there can be no inference, as to whether we're interested or not interested.","But, inline with the question that was previously asked, we are most committed to the, the future of Dentistry and particularly the digitalization of Dentistry. And in that connection the implant is important, both the device itself and the prosthetic. And we need to be bigger players in the device and the prosthetics in all its forms, whether the prosthetics are custom milled or they're prefabricated.","And there's a lot of software that's involved in this. So, one must be careful not to look at any particular part of our oral care equation ,the whole area of practice management, clinical and otherwise and pick one piece over the other. It's a whole continuum of care and we are very, very much understanding of the market today and where it's heading. And Henry Schein is committed as the largest provider of Dental products and services in the world to continue to be a place where Dentist look for guidance and the place where the Dentist can find the one stop solution.","So, they will be roomed in the implant market for the high-end as people refer to more expensive implants. The middle high quality and I believe that both BioHorizons and Camlog has the best in implant systems in the marketplace that maybe less expensive.","But if you look at Germany for example, we're selling more implants and may even have more dollars than anyone else in the marketplace. It is debatable how close we are to the number or whether we are the number one but the bottom-line our solution in Germany for example and some other countries is working well. BioHorizons is working well and we will add to that both in terms of the implant, the prosthetic, the software, the biologics, et cetera, so, we are interested in growing our position in the whole prosthetics field and on multiple upfront.","And we believe we are well-positioned through our global prosthetics group to understand the dynamics and have excellent solutions. So, we are committed to the whole area of digital and prosthetics in general.","Jeff Bailin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","I appreciate all of that color. Maybe just one follow-up again on the dental market. Appreciate your commentary from earlier. As we look at the international performance, is there anything worth calling out in any specific geographies in terms of either accelerating or decelerating growth that are areas to watch?","Stanley Bergman","Yeah. I would say Europe in general is leaning towards a positive. You have to be very careful in shifting through what was a terrific IDS last year. I would say the market is leaning positive. There are few markets that are not so positive, few there a little bit more positive, but generally the market is positive.","I would point out the one market that is doing exceptionally well at this point and that's Australia. I am not sure, yes, I think that there are probably people on this call that would recall, for sure that last year we spoke about very negative market.","This previous government had withdrawn funding for oral care and that sucked out a lot of sales from the market. This government has reinstituted the support for oral care and providing excess to oral care general, to the underserved, and the mood in the Australian Dental market is exceptional.","I just came back from the international sales meeting and the mood amongst our sales people, amongst our suppliers is excellent. Again, I think we are well-positioned to provide solutions. We have an outstanding consultative salesforce down there. We are the leader in software, and our well-positioned in CAD\/CAM and had a number of very exciting products and exclusives that we offer them.","So, I would have to say that if I think through and look around the world that is a very good market outside of Untied States and Canada.","Jeff Bailin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Great. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Block of Stifel.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus","Great. Thanks, good morning. Maybe just to start -it was another solid quarter with North American dental equipment results. And, Steve, you mentioned a couple things before, but any color you can give specific to high-tech growth versus traditional? Then maybe if you could provide an update with where you are with the PlanScan rollout at Aspen practices? Thank you.","Steven Paladino","Sure. I'll give you some detail, the North American equipment growth, the total growth was 10.8%. Again it was across the board in both traditional and high-tech equipments, specifically traditional equipment was about 6.8% growth and high-tech was little over 17% growth.","And within high-tech again, our PlanScan E4D product was the fastest growing category of all equipment traditional or otherwise. So, we're very happy with the performance there. I'll also say that equipment, the backlog continues to be strong. So, we have that strong equipment growth but we continue to have a good backlog at the end of the quarter both domestically and internationally.","With related to, I don't know the particulars on the Aspen roll-out, to be honest with you. But I would say that that was not a major driver in our overall sales growth but I don't really know the particulars on that.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus","Okay, perfect. Fair enough. Then, secondly, just to shift gears, you started the Q&A off talking about Animal Health and specific to IDEX and you have mentioned you have seen other manufacturers go exclusive before. But can you talk to us specifically about your salesforce and your salesforce's ability to move market share and maybe what you've seen in the past when other manufacturers have gone ahead and opted to go down the direct road? Thank you.","Stanley Bergman","I want to be careful not to turn these things, but very good question, and if I were you, I'd be asking or trying to figure this out as well. But I want to be careful not to make this a negative comment.","So, let me just begin with, I think you've seen in the Dental market in the past, that's one manufacturer to deciding to limit distribution, to one distributor or two. And I think you've seen our track record and our ability to respond in a professional way and in fact gain market share.","I think you could see similar trends in the Animal Health space around pet food, nutritional food and I think you've seen that, we've also done okay in that regard.","We've also done very well in explaining to manufacturers that broad distribution is in the interest of the customer as was the case when we made our investment in Butler Schein at the time, now Henry Schein Animal Health.","With that time, Henry Schein was representing five or six manufacturers and Butler at that time was representing one because of market, the market issues, the manufacturers wouldn't allow us to, one manufacturer wouldn't allow us to carry the competitors line or all of the stuff in the end when you open up the market is better for consumer and what's better for the consumer is better for Henry Schein.","So, if you look at all that history, you will see that anytime there's been a strength, generally it's inhibited the market. Any time it has opened up, it is much better for a market, any time you have competition, it's better, I'm a big fan of the free markets and this restriction business in the end doesn't pay off, I think Henry Schein has a long tradition \u2013 there are examples where it works better because you may need more resources in one way or other to advance the product.","But I think Henry Schein's history as a outstanding value added distributor has shown that we've always been able to find the right balance of products with. There were restrictions on limiting us to sell dental chairs or there were restrictions at one point to limit us from selling anesthetic, because the leading anesthetic company at the time, with 70% or 80% market share decided to go direct.","In the end we are the largest provider of anesthetic in the world today, with sensors at one point or another. We were restricted us from the leading brand. Today we are the largest provider in sensors. The largest provider of dental chairs. The largest provider of 3D X-ray and all of these things, they're in the end are not good for the customer.","So, I would say they are always exceptions and I am quite sure that our track record if examined carefully, - Steven would be happy to take you through specifics. I don't this is the time today to name particular companies. But this is all public information and you could see that generally Henry Schein has done, okay.","And these thing are sometimes a waste of time but at the end invariably Henry Schein turns out to be a better company.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus","Perfect. Thanks so much for the comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird.","Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird","","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a couple quick follow-ups here. Steve, was hoping I could go back to maybe Bob's question on the North American dental consumables market. And I hear your answer, things getting better sequentially and obviously you can see that in the numbers, so that's good.","If I adjust for selling days, it seems like you maybe even were up closer to the low end of that, the normalized historical range we think about at 4% to 6% or so. Is it fair to think then as we go through the rest of the year? I know you don't guide by segment and don't guide growth in that, but it feels like if we adjust we get back up to that kind of number. Is it fair to think about that being a reasonable target for the back half of the year?","Steven Paladino","So, again, I don't want to give specifics but I do think that the potential for our sales growth to accelerate on the merchandise, we feel like there is potential for that to occur. If you look it within the quarter, both May and June were stronger than April, so, it did accelerate within the quarter.","July was also a good month for consumable merchandise, for us now one month does not make a quarter, so don't be too much into that. But it's still good directionally.","So we do feel like there is potential for some slight acceleration going forward. But again Jeff, since we don't give specifics, I'd rather not be specific on that.","Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird","The May, June, July comments are helpful there, so I appreciate that. Then my only other question really is on the cash flow side; a nice rebound here this quarter, at least relative to last quarter. Year-over-year still down. I think that is a comparison issue, if I remember right, from early 2013 where there are some reversals from late 2012.","But bottom line, are you still thinking cash flow both operating cash flow and even it looks like free cash flow here can grow nicely above net income this year and kind of over the next few years? Is that still a reasonable target? One. And, two, CapEx may be a little bit higher than we are thinking so far through this year. Just what should the CapEx target be this year? Thanks.","Steven Paladino","Okay. So, we do feel like if we look forward on operating cash flow, it should grow at similar rates as our bottom line net income growth. So, we do believe that that is very achievable growth for us.","Remember, there's a little bit of a more difficult comparison both in Q1 and Q2 because last year on cash flow we got the reversal of the medical device excise tax, the buy-in that we did in the prior year.","So, it's a little bit of a more difficult comparable related to that. And I'm just trying to remember, your second question on CapEx, yeah, this year the CapEx is a little bit higher than normal. We'll probably be something just north of $60 million of CapEx, maybe in the mid 60 something like that.","So it is a little bit higher than typical this year because of some investments. But we do feel good about organic cash flow overall.","Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird","","Okay. It just sounds like the CapEx run rate can slow down then a little bit from what we have seen in the first half. That's fair?","Steven Paladino","Yeah, like I said, we should be in the mid 60s for the full year.","Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird","","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Steven Paladino","Okay.","Operator","Your final question is from John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair","","Hi. Thanks very much. Stan, you've talked about digital restorative dentistry being a very big trend. Can you just contrast what you are seeing in the North American versus the European markets? Which region are you seeing embrace this trend more aggressively based upon the kind of order flow you are getting?","Stanley Bergman","That's a good question. Look, digital dentistry, digital prosthetic dentistry is much more than chair side, right. I think chair side gets a lot of attention because some owners of public company and Patterson and Schein are public company.","But there's lot more to this. The whole digital prosthetic arena, many of the companies in that space and I forgot to mention, Dentsply and to some extent 3M as well. But for Dentsply and 3M, and particularly 3M, it is not \u2013 doesn't come out in the numbers.","So, Wall Street is focused truly I think on the public sector and there's much more behind this, as the whole area of prosthetics is largely, to a very large extent in the hands of small private companies, and some actually larger companies but in the private sector.","So, the area of prosthetics and if you go even further, you'll see that you have the implants. And some of those companies do have, the public companies do have an element of digital prosthetics as well. So, we have to understand this market in a very broad sense and where it's headed.","As far as the chair side, I think Europe of course is little bit more advanced because CEREC was introduced in Europe over a quarter century ago, and particularly in Germany.","So, the goal is of course to find new customers. And then each new customer presents an opportunity for the digital materials et cetera, et cetera.","So, Europe is more advanced than the U.S. it's relatively new in the U.S. I would say primarily because it is only offered through one distributor. Now the market is being serviced by us as well. So, now you have about two-thirds of the dental distributors with digital solutions. There's another, one or two other solutions that are offered by some of our smaller competitors, but the whole awareness of digital dentistry prosthetics is going.","So, I speak to you as the pick-up in this regard off, I think a smaller base per capita, per dentist than Europe. So, I think the opportunities are good in both sides, on both sides of the Atlantic and also in other markets, Australia as well.","I don't want to comment on Japan because we're not in that market yet, so, but I believe that so, the whole area of digital materials is getting very, very exciting. And there are a lot of players that will enter this market and I think you'll see all sorts of exciting tools coming from different players and through Henry Schein.","And I am not only, again, referring to the chair side but the whole laboratory side as well where there is a lot of activity going on. Smaller companies, lot of innovations and the labs are automating in a rather rapid way. There are going to be fewer labs, bigger labs, more capital intensive and so this whole market is very, very exciting.","But I caution, Wall Street not to view this through the lands of just a few companies but to take a look at the whole market and I think for all the dental players this is going to be exciting.","I think, Danaher also just announced their entry into the space. So, this whole world is getting exciting and it's far more complex then just looking at through the lanes of one or two companies.","John Kreger - William Blair","","Very helpful, thanks. Maybe just one more. Steve, would you be able to give us your organic growth rates in some of those -- your dental specialty categories? I am curious of those are growing faster or slower than your general consumable trend?","Steven Paladino","The answer is generally yes. This quarter though because of again Camlog is probably the biggest of our specialty group and because of one less selling day in Germany and that's the strongest market, you have to adjust for that. And if you adjust for that, the specialty numbers are growing at a faster rate than the basic dental consumable numbers. Again but you have to adjust for Germany because of that one less selling day.","John Kreger - William Blair","Great. Thank you.","Steven Paladino","Okay.","Stanley Bergman","Okay. So, thank you everybody for calling in. Appreciate your interest. I think we at Henry Schein are in three very, very exciting markets that are going through transformation, where they are ready to provide value added services, where they, - not only on technology offering but a whole host of value-added services.","The dental market is exciting, going through transformation and we are very well-positioned, the largest provider of dental products and services in the world. Likewise on the Animal Health side, a lot of exciting developments there. I believe, strategically we're well placed. We've made some good decisions along the way and are well-positioned now to execute on those decisions. It's a global positioning. The largest distributor of Animal Health products, very, very exciting.","And then the Medical business, we have been waiting for this transformation now for six, seven, eight years. We created a health care services group almost six years ago, they are doing well, they are doing well with these large accounts of the IDNs.","Of course, this is all a trend and nothing materials is going to happen in one quarter or two but directionally Henry Schein is well placed. And I believe our strategies are good, the morale in the company is good and we're generating good cash flow as a company.","And so, I thank you for your interest. And have a great rest of the summer. And we'll be back again in about 90 days. Thanks.","Operator","This does conclude the conference. You may all disconnect."],"11003":["Henry Schein, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, Holly and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2019 fourth quarter and full year. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.","Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business.","These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the supplemental info section of our Investor Relations website and in Exhibit B of today's press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, February 20th, 2020. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up during Q&A to allow as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour we have allotted for this call.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you very much Carolynne. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. 2019 was a historic year for Henry Schein, with a spin-off of our global Animal Health business as well as the continued integration of Henry Schein One, which offers an extraordinary array of best-in-class dental software solutions to help dentists optimize the management of their practices, provide better communications to patients and drive greater traffic to the practice.","Our global dental and medical businesses continued to demonstrate solid growth. As our end markets evolve, we are aligning our business with the segments that we believe offer the best opportunities for our long-term growth in sales and in profits. We are excited about the future of Henry Schein and believe we have strategically positioned our business for continued success in the healthcare markets we serve.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered internal sales growth from continuing operations at 4.9% in local currency, which excludes sales of Covetrus -- exclude sales to Covetrus. This was highlighted by strong revenue growth in our medical and technology and value-added services businesses, along with North American dental equipment and international consumable merchandise.","These sales results contributed to an increase in diluted EPS from continuing operations of 192.2% on a GAAP basis, impacted by net gain on the sales of equity -- of the sale of an equity investment and EPS growth of 9% on a non-GAAP basis.","Overall, we believe our performance was an excellent conclusion to this transformative year. Today, we are affirming our guidance range from -- for 2020, non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $3.65 to $3.75. Steven will discuss this in greater detail in a moment.","So, the overall conclusion to the quarter, to the year, to the state of the company is that we continue to make, in our belief, solid progress in growing our business organically, 4.9% growth organically in the fourth quarter, with a focus on gaining market share, advancing sales of high-margin products and driving efficiencies throughout the business, while at the same time, making investments in strategic businesses that advance the Henry Schein footprint of products and value-added services.","We expect to continue to generate significant cash flow each year and plan to put this to work with strategic transactions, investing in our infrastructure, R&D and our specialty and software businesses, while at the same time, returning cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.","In addition, we are working very well with a number of strategic suppliers to advance our goals. And overall, we believe we are moving in a direction that will continue to advance EPS growth and so the cash flow and so shareholder value. More information a little bit further down the call.","At this time, I'll hand the call over to Steven to review our financial results and guidance and then provide some commentary on recent business performance and accomplishments. Thank you. Steven?","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stanley and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis, and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q4 2019 and Q4 2018 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and also in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website.","Please note, as we mentioned on our last earnings call, Q4 2019 non-GAAP results also exclude a net gain on the sale of equity investments primarily related to Hu-Friedy, a manufacturer of dental instruments and infection prevention solutions.","Please note that we have again included a corporate sales category for Q4 that represents sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreements and we expect that to continue through August of 2020.","Turning now to our Q4 results, net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 28th, 2019, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 7.9% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 5.8%.","When excluding the sales to Covetrus under the TSA agreements, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.9%. And I'll note that, that was the highest quarterly growth rate that we've seen in the past year and a half. Details of our sales growth are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings press release that was issued earlier this morning.","On a GAAP basis, operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 7.4% and increased 97 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin of 7.3% contracted by 47 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This margin contraction was primarily due to certain increases in certain employee-related costs. For the full year 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin of 7.3% was essentially flat compared with 2018.","Our long-term annual operating margin growth of 20 -- growth goal of 20 basis points per year expansion continues to remain intact. However, in 2020, we expect to achieve less than that 20 basis points of expansion due to stranded costs associated with the Animal Health spin-off as well as certain additional technology investments. You will find a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin also in the supplemental information page on our investor page of our website.","Turning to taxes, our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 22.3%. This compares with 14.9% GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of last year. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was also similar at 22.2% and compares with the prior year non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21.2%.","Our full year 2019 effective tax rate was 23.4% on a GAAP basis, which compares with the full year 2018 effective tax rate on a GAAP basis of 20.0%. Our non-GAAP -- based -- on a non-GAAP basis, our 2019 effective tax rate was 23.7% compared with 22.9% in 2018.","For 2020, we estimate that our effective tax rate will continue to be in the 23% range on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Again, look at the supplemental information page on our Investor Relations website for a reconciliation of GAAP taxes to non-GAAP taxes.","Moving on, net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for Q4 of 2019 was $330.6 million or $2.25 per diluted share. And this compares with the prior year GAAP net income from continuing operations of $117.8 million or $0.77 per diluted share.","Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $143.0 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, and this compares with non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $136.2 million or $0.89 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018. This represents growth of 5% and 9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.","Providing some additional detail on our results, on a continuing operations basis, amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q4 2019 was $26.9 million pretax, or $0.14 per diluted share compared with $19.1 million pretax or $0.09 per diluted share for the same period last year.","For the full year 2019, amortization was $105.9 million pretax or $0.53 per diluted share, and that compares to $75.3 million pretax or $0.37 per diluted share in 2018. I'll also note that for Q4 of 2019, foreign currency exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share.","Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the fourth quarter. Our dental sales were $1.7 billion and increased 2.9% compared with the prior year, with internal growth in local currencies of 2.5%. North American internal sales in local currencies grew 2.2% and included a decline of 0.1% in sales of dental consumable merchandise. And that's really reflecting a soft end market demand primarily for independent dental practices.","Internal sales growth in local currencies in North America -- for North American dental equipment and services increased 7.2% year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by double-digit high-tech equipment sales, which were bolstered by a key supplier of sales event held early in October.","Sales in our CAD\/CAM business were particularly strong and Stanley will have more comments in this area later on in the call. Our current dental equipment backlog in North America also suggests continued growth in Q1.","International dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 3.0%. This included 4.4% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and growth in international consumable merchandise was driven by really broad-based gains across most of our international businesses.","Internal sales growth in local currencies and international dental equipment sales and services declined 0.8% as we faced a difficult year-over-year comparison with internal sales growth in the prior year of 7.5%. The sales decrease was also due in part to soft macroeconomic conditions in Australia.","Our current international dental equipment backlog also suggests a return to growth in Q1 2020. We also reported mid to high single-digit sales growth in our various dental specialty businesses in North America, and internationally and Stan will discuss that in further detail also later in the call.","Our medical sales were $788.7 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 15.2%, with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 10.2%. The 10.2% internal growth in local currencies really consisted of 10.3% growth in North America and 5.5% growth internationally. Medical sales growth results were again driven by both solid organic growth and a strong contribution from North American rescue, a recent acquisition.","Technology and value-added services sales from continuing operations were $137.1 million in the quarter, an increase of 20%, with internally generated sales growth in local currencies' growth of 9.4%. In North America, the technology and value-added services internal sales growth in local currencies was 8.7%. These sales benefited from customers upgrading their Microsoft Windows operating system to remain software compliant as well as strong financial services revenue. Internationally, technology and value-added services internal sales increased by 13.4% in local currencies. These sales were also fueled by strong financial services revenues.","During the quarter, we continued to repurchase common stock in the open market by buying approximately 2.9 million shares at an average price of $69.05 per share for a total of approximately $200 million of purchases. The impact of these repurchases of shares in the fourth quarter EPS was immaterial.","For the full year, we did spend $525 million to repurchase approximately 8.2 million shares. Also, it's important to note that at year-end, Henry Schein had approximately $275 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock.","If we take now a brief look at some of the highlights of our cash flow. We had very strong operating cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter at $295.3 million, and that's compared to $181.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","For the year, the operating cash flow from continuing operations was also very strong at $820.5 million, and that compares to $450 million in 2018. Our CapEx for the year was $76.2 million, and that results in free cash flow from continuing operations of $744.3 million.","As we have previously discussed, we plan on implementing a new restructuring initiative in 2020 to help mitigate stranded costs from expiring services under the TSA related to the Animal Health spin-off, as well as to look for additional opportunities to reduce expenses and drive operating efficiencies. We will provide additional details as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year.","So, I'll conclude my remarks by noting that we are reaffirming our 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS. At this time, we will not be providing GAAP diluted EPS guidance as we are unable to provide an accurate estimate of expenses related to the restructuring that I just mentioned.","2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $3.65 to $3.75, reflecting a growth of 4% to 7% compared with its 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was $3.51. I think it's important to note that our guidance assumes that there is no significant supply chain disruption related to the novel coronavirus for certain infection control products.","Our guidance for 2020, non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to shine from continuing operations also includes any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions as well as restructuring expenses. Our guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates that are generally consistent with current levels, and this guidance also assumes that the end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions.","Before I turn the call over to Stanley, I would like to make a further comment about the current impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which Stan will also address. Our sales in China as a proportion of total global dental sales are relatively small today. That said, we are monitoring the situation carefully as the spike in demand and corresponding limited supply for personal protective equipment such as masks and gowns is having a global impact.","As Stan will describe, we are closely working with our manufacturing and supply chain partners as well as the pandemic supply chain network, the World Health Organization, the Chinese Ministry of Health, and the CDC to address product shortages as they may occur. At this time, it's difficult, if not impossible, to estimate a potential impact to our business related to supply -- related to potential supply constraints.","So, with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Before turning to the 2019 fourth quarter, I'd like to review a few highlights for the year. We achieved net sales from continuing operations of approximately $10 billion, with internal sales up 4% from 2018 in local currencies, which excludes sales to Covetrus.","GAAP diluted EPS increased 67.5%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS growth was 10.7%, both on continuing operations basis. We were pleased with very strong operating cash flow of $820 million, which increased by $369 million versus 2018.","In addition, in 2019, we completed 10 major majority-owned strategic transactions as we continue to expand our geographic presence and enhance our product offerings. Together, these acquisitions have trailing 12 months revenue at the time of purchase of approximately $350 million.","We also continue to commercialize -- we also continue the commercialization of Henry Schein One, a significant development in support of our long-term growth plans. Our value-added solutions such as dental software leads stickiness in our base business, as our customers look to Henry Schein for much more than just merchandise and equipment.","Value-added services is a key part of our growth strategy, both as it relates to the stickiness of customers and actually driving earnings per share. This often translates into recurring sales of these value-added services, with a higher margin profiles and accordingly, as I just noted, earnings accretion. Some acquisition highlights for -- in 2019 included our entry into the Nordic dental market, a market we had not have presence up to now; and the expansion of our dental business in China.","In the medical market, we broadened our solutions offering, serving the defense and public safety markets. And on the technology side, we enhanced our offering with patient communication software and established a dental software presence in Italy as well as in Austria.","Going forward, we have significant opportunities to allocate capital in support of our 2018 to 2020 strategic bet and beyond this, actually into our 2021, 2022 and 2023 plans. These opportunities are focused on three main areas. First, in distribution, with the expansion of our core dental and medical businesses as we continue to build scale and expand our new -- into new geographies as well as drive efficiencies in the businesses on the distribution side.","Second, we will continue to invest in value-added services, advancing our solutions, services and support for customers; and third, partnering with a broad set of manufacturers as well as building the Henry Schein brand with the key goal of expanding gross margins. This will, of course, advance business for manufacturers that we work closely with, while at the same time, advancing our own brands specifically in the specialty markets.","So, fourth quarter 2019, some highlights. On the dental side, North American dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies was essentially flat. This reflects soft end market demand from independent dental practices. I would note that for the fiscal 2019, North American dental consumable merchandise internal sales growth was 1.2% in local currencies.","North American dental equipment had a healthy increase in internal sales of approximately 7% in local currencies, primarily driven by high-tech equipment sales across multiple manufacturers, but also as it relates to traditional -- the contribution of sales of traditional products.","Also, our sales were positively impacted by our participation in a key supplier sales event in early part of the quarter, particularly for CAD\/CAM and dental laser products. In the fourth quarter, internal sales in local currencies for high-tech equipment increased approximately 11%, including CAD\/CAM equipment growth of more than 50% and traditional equipment growth of nearly 5%. Our current dental equipment backlog in North America suggests continued sales growth in the first quarter of 2020. We believe we have a healthy backlog in the North American equipment market.","Internationally, dental consumables, internal sales growth in local currencies were solid with more than 4% increase, driven by broad-based strength across most of our businesses on the international side. International dental equipment internal growth declined by approximately 1% in local currencies, reflecting a difficult prior year comparison as well as a slower economy in Australia, although we believe that the backlog in Australia will also result in decent comeback in that market.","In the fourth quarter, internal sales of global dental specialty products increased approximately 6% in local currencies. For 2020, we believe the run rate for sales of our differentiated dental specialty product portfolio will be in the range of $650 million.","Dental specialty sales was approximately 12% of our total dental consumable merchandise sales in 2018 -- sorry, 2019. We believe our focus on this high-growth and higher-margin specialty areas offer significant growth opportunities over the long term.","Our dental strategy is focused on promoting customer success through several key initiatives that help enable customer business efficiency and better clinical outcomes. Our key is to help our customers operate a more efficient practice so that our customers can provide better clinical care. This includes enhanced mechanisms of collecting customer feedback and the launch of our common CRM platform, bringing us closer to our customers by helping to improve sales and support capabilities. The internal changes that we have introduced successfully will help us help our customers succeed.","We are also focused on supporting long-term gains in sales and profitability with additional key talent that we've added over the years, last few years, bringing additional capabilities that are contemporary in nature as well as we have expanded our product and service offerings. This all, we believe, bodes well for our global dental business.","Now, let's move to our medical business, where we delivered strong internal sales growth, up 4% in the fourth quarter of more than 10% in local currencies, with the highest growth coming from our large enterprise customers. We also recorded solid sales increases from our mid-market and our general practitioners customers.","So, across the Board, we generated decent and actually very good internal growth from all the customer categories in the medical business. We believe we continue to gain market share in the medical business as we deliver on a robust segmentation strategy inclusive of health systems, ambulatory surgical centers, large group practices, and independent offices.","In 2019, we highlighted our focus on the university health and workplace safety, workplace health settings, both areas further diversifying Henry Schein's footprint and reflect meaningful long-term opportunity. Going forward, we will continue to cultivate our capabilities in each end market segment and offer our providers relevant products and solutions to drive outcomes.","Our procedures and care continue to migrate -- as procedures and care continue to migrate out of the hospital, specialization remains very important to our medical business strategy. Gastroenterology, orthopedics and dermatology are just a few of the areas of focus. And Henry Schein has robust plans to deliver value in these growth segments.","We are also committed to supporting providers with highly focused specialist solutions to help support clinical outcomes in the medical environment. One example is point-of-care diagnostics, which is undergoing a shift from lateral flow devices to molecular diagnostics. Our dedicated point-of-care specialists can help providers navigate the shift. Our credibility, in fact, has resulted in significant growth in business in the diagnostic area and specifically the point-of-care diagnostic area.","During the quarter, our team also continued to focus on delivering core services that bring exceptional value to our customers, such as telemedicine, the telemedicine platform to help optimize healthcare delivery and maximize patient engagement. In addition, the digital marketing solutions we offer are helping our customers, prospect and secure new patients. Value-added services in the medical sector are also a key part of our growth strategy from a customer stickiness point of view and from a profit generation point of view.","Looking ahead, we plan to continue to invest in expanding these solutions platforms to address customer clinical, financial and operational needs, whether in the general practitioner, subacute, care or large enterprise settings.","Let's move to our technology and value-added services businesses. On a global basis, technology and value-added services internal growth grew in excess of 9% in local currencies in the fourth quarter. 2019 was an important year in the positioning of Henry Schein One as we undertook important initiatives to further operationalize the integration of the two business units that came together to create Henry Schein One.","We see many opportunities to our customers across the spectrum with the general practitioners, mid-market practitioners, large-scale DSOs, helping them to adopt these innovative software solutions to help drive practice outreach. That's new business and efficiency.","We have a significant domestic installed base of practice management solutions and a growing international base that represents prime customers for our practice, engagement and demand generation tools. Lots of opportunities to take our installed base and add additional software capabilities to that base.","We are also enhancing our cloud-based software business with Dentrix Ascend, particularly with DSOs, but this also has significant benefit for mid-market practices that wish to centralize patient data. During the fourth quarter, we had several exciting new product introductions at Henry Schein One. We launched the beta version of our Tech [ph] Dentrix, quick goal e-statements with online bill pay. This solution will offices streamline collection processes and reduce mailing cost and accelerate cash flow. We launched Dentrix G7.3, offering ledger improvements to help customers track and identify adjustments as well as improve insurance payment processes.","During the fourth quarter, we released a new chairside dashboard for Dentrix Ascend in the Symbian cloud-based system, enhancing clinical patient data for the dentists. Also, we completed development work on demand for steady intervention with Dentrix Ascend, allowing the two platforms to sync data and function better together.","There is a lot of exciting development work going on at Henry Schein One as we continue to evolve as a service provider and trusted resource for a broad selection of products and services to, as we noted earlier on, to the various sectors of the dental market, small, mid-sized, and very large practices.","Before I turn the call over to general questions, I would like to add to Steven's comments on the novel coronavirus. Henry Schein has a long history as a pioneer in our industry as a thought leader, problem solver and catalysts of public-private partnerships to address pressing complex health issues, specifically in the infection control area. One example of this is our deep engagement in pandemic preparedness and disaster relief for more than 25 years.","As we saw from SARS, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, and now with the novel coronavirus outbreak, the risk of infectious diseases outbreaks is ever-present and possesses critical risks to the global health supply chain. Out of desire to learn the lessons of the past and save lives in the future, we leveraged Henry Schein's expertise, supply chain leadership and extensive network of relationships with our supplier partners, health professionals and international organizations to catalyze the public-private collaboration called the pandemic supply chain network and that was in 2015 when we established this network.","The pandemic supply chain network works to accelerate the delivery of critical supplies to frontline health professionals by providing market visibility, needs planning, production capabilities and risk forecasting for healthcare supplies.","Henry Schein serves as co-founder and private sector lead for the pandemic supply chain network along with the World Health Organization, the U.N. World Food program, the World Bank, UNICEF, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Economic Forum. In this capacity, Henry Schein service as the main liaison between more than 40 members of the private sector, including UPS, and J&J, with 10 multilateral organizations in helping to advance this work.","In addition, our innovative strategy of prepositioning donations of critical healthcare products with our strategic NGL partners to enable these organizations to swiftly respond to emergencies has enabled us to donate needed supplies to frontline health workers.","A prepositioned donation of masks that Henry Schein had made back in September 2019 to MedShare International, MAP International, and Project HOPE was quickly deployed in China via the appropriate channels working with local Chinese authorities to help address the outbreak. Those donation at the time was valued at nearly $1 million.","We see our leadership in developing innovative approaches to pandemic preparedness, and response is an important pathway for us to most effectively serve our customers make a critical contribution to society and as a key differentiator of Henry Schein as a global area in this -- a global leader in this area, all contributing to the important value of Henry Schein as an entity.","So, with that overview, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator, please open the line. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is going to come from the line of Jon Block, Stifel.","Jon Block","Thanks guys. Good morning. First one, Stanley, just the slight North American consumable number, I mean, it can always move around quarter-to-quarter. But this time, you called out particular weakness with the independents. And so just wondering if there's anything to elaborate on? Are there increasing pressures from this cohort from DSOs? I'd love more color there. Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Yes, I don't think it's a pressure from DSOs per se. I think that there is an element of steady demand for services. I don't think it's decreasing. But also, there is, I would think, a searching for products that are perhaps lower priced that achieve the same outcomes.","But overall, we believe the market is steady, the -- and up significantly growing. It is very hard to define exactly what an independent is and what a midsized practice is. The midsized practices are growing faster than the independents, but it's hard to tell exactly.","We try to provide general guidance, but there's no scientific methodology for determining the one versus the other. But we believe that the market, from a procedure point, is relatively stable, with significant growth in some of the specialty areas. You cannot tell that from our numbers because our specialty products, as a percent of the total products, are relatively small, but as a percent of the profits are a little bit greater. So, we try to give some sense, but there's no scientific way of delineating between small practices and midsized practices.","Jon Block","Okay, got it. And Steven, the second one, I sort of use this as a clarification. So the specialty consumable number, Stanley, as you mentioned, again, solid growth, 6% plus. I think you mentioned the total bucket for the year around $650 million. I might be mistaken, but I thought in the past, that number was higher, like $750 million, maybe even $800 million plus. It obviously been growing. So, is that a refined number or refined definition of specialty consumables? And if so, what were some of the tweaks there. I'll follow-up offline with others. Thanks guys.","Steven Paladino","Sure. Yes, Jon. There was a refinement of the number. Historically, we were looking at all specialty products, which included a small portion of medical specialty products. And we thought it was more appropriate, really, to delineate just in dental specialty products. So, the total number is still correct, but the dental piece of it is at $650 million number.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Steve Valiquette, Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Jonathan on for Steve today. Just going back to your comment that independents are looking for lower-priced products. If we couple that with procedures are essentially stable, does that mean that the independents are shifting from you guys and just going to competitors and some of the online discounters, et cetera?","Stanley Bergman","I don't believe that is the case per se. I believe the alternate channels to the full service, whether it's online or short line discount providers, is relatively stable. We know this from having a bit of access to this market data through some of our investments. I don't think that is the case necessarily, but I do believe they are shopping for lower-priced units of product that are similar. And so I think there is somewhat of a downward drift in the unit price per product.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, fair enough. And then just on the DSO market, can you tell us kind of what you're seeing in the market there? Is there -- are compares being a little bit more aggressive in trying to take market share, et cetera? And I guess was there any softness similar to what you saw in the independent market? Or is it relatively stable there? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","I think that market is relatively stable. We've always had significant competition in that market from time to time, one distributor or another may be super aggressive. Our posture is that we provide significant value-added services to DSOs, in particular, in the area of data and in the area of practice management software. And we feel that for that, our pricing needs to be fair so that we can afford to pay for the resources we provide, including human capital and make a decent margin.","So, I would say that this market has always been competitive. We win some accounts, we lose some accounts. We do not report every transaction that goes on in that market. I think that will be too onerous. Having said that, I believe that market is relatively stable.","Steven Paladino","I would just add one other thing on the DSOs. It's more difficult to quantify what the unit growth there is because DSOs, by their nature, not only do they acquire certain products, but practices. But even if they start a new practice, it's difficult to determine how much of that new practice revenues is cannibalizing other practices and how much of it is real market growth.","So, that's why it's harder to really quantify what's going on in the DSOs as far as market growth perspective. Yes, they're growing, but some of it is really, again, cannibalization. And it's cleaner on the independents and that's why we cited the independents because you don't have that dynamic.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Jeff Johnson, Baird.","Carolynne Borders","Jeff, are you there?","Operator","Hi, Jeff, go ahead with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi sorry, I was on mute. This is Corin [ph] on for Jeff. I know China is a very small part of your overall business, but especially with the recent acquisition of a Chinese distributorship located in Wuhan, we'd love to hear your perspective in general about the recent dental demand in China and how widespread the slowdown in dental demand is across China?","Stanley Bergman","Yes. First of all, our percentage of sales in China versus our international sales in dental or even our global sale -- or our global sales is immaterial. We do own an interest in one of the largest -- maybe is the largest distributor of dental products in Wuhan, but the impact to both the sales and bottom line is not material.","As it relates to dental sales in China, I think the best is to do some research on your own relative to healthcare services being provided in China. By and large, the only services that are being provided in big parts of China are essential healthcare services. There are some parts of China where dental services continue to be provided, but a huge part of China, dental services are not being provided. So, this, of course, only kicked in, in the third week of January or so, maybe early February.","We don't know when the government will restore general dental -- general medical services, and in fact, dental services. This is what creates a question mark in our mind. I don't think we're unique. I believe this is the case in all healthcare. But we believe that the Chinese government will restore healthcare services in the near future because it is important to the population. But of course, none of us know the exact date when that is going to happen in any specific region. ","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you. And one other question. We know you don't really guide to revenue growth, but can you provide any high-level thoughts on the North American dental consumables and equipment growth for 2020.","Steven Paladino","Yes. Again, let me just mention that related to coronavirus, one of the issues separate from our Chinese business, which again, as Stanley said, is small and not material, there is a question on availability of product from manufacturers on certain products, specifically things like masks and gowns and disinfectants. We saw a little bit of an accelerated demand early in Q1, but we do have limited supply, and we are really not sure when we will be able to get additional supply if there will be no disruption or if there'll be some or significant disruption, it's impossible to tell right now.","So, demand really caveats that whole area because if we don't have supply, that will negatively impact the demand in consumables. So excluding any significant impact related to that, we still think that the market, while it's soft, really isn't dramatically changed. It is stable. So, we're expecting that to continue. We continue to have stable demand and products for consumables.","The other thing that we're looking to do, Stanley highlighted it in his prepared remarks is, again, continue to grow in faster subcategories of the market like dental specialties to help offset that, the slower growth in general consumable products. So, I think we're really expecting stability in the consumable market going forward in our guidance.","Unidentified Analyst","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson","HI, good morning guys. Could you just -- I'm sorry, I apologize if I missed it, but could you talk about the impact of flu on medical in the quarter?","Steven Paladino","Sure. We didn't specifically mention flu as -- I guess, there's two components of influenza. One is the actual flu vaccine that we sell to our customers. That was strong, but it's not a big driver of the overall growth, really, because it was a more severe flu and virus season. We saw patient traffic to the physician offices accelerate a bit. It's unfortunate that it's the severe season this year, but it is, and that does drive overall patient traffic and overall demand in products other than influenza per se -- influenza vaccine per se.","Elizabeth Anderson","Got it. And could you just comment broadly on where you are in terms of DSO renewals for the year?","Steven Paladino","Yes. So, we feel -- we don't like to talk about specific entities and specific situations. We think from a competitive point of view, we're better off really not talking about that. But I will say that we feel very good with our large DSO customers. We feel like we have very strong relationships of providing exceptional service and feel good about our ability to continue to serve that customer base.","And although there are some of our competitors who are looking to grow in that space, it is a little bit different than non-DSO business. And the requirements that these customers have is a little bit different. And we feel like we are uniquely positioned to be able to serve them really well. So, on average, we feel good about this customer base.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Nathan Rich, Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow-up on your commentary about kind of changing purchasing pattern from the independent practices. I mean, do you feel like this is a more permanent shift in how they think about purchasing supplies? And I'd be curious to kind of know the nature of the changes that you're seeing? Is it more lower-priced brands, more private label? And do you think that it ultimately has an impact on how they're thinking about purchasing equipment as well? ","Stanley Bergman","So, there are two questions in that. The one, Nathan, is related to consumables. I think that small practices, midsized and large practices will spend more money per unit of product if there is some innovation in that product. We feel quite comfortable that with many of our key suppliers, there are innovative products coming out, that come out and are coming out, and that will drive products, that will drive pricing up, I think, of certain units.","I don't think this is a permanent change unless there's no innovation. But we understand from our key suppliers that they are current new -- current products, good products that have been launched, innovative products that have been launched and that the pipeline continues to have products going forward, new products. As it relates to equipment, there have been competitive pricing challenges in certain imaging products. I don't believe that is the case any longer.","And we know for sure, at least amongst our customer base, that they are investing in their practices, whether it's in CAD\/CAM, laser or for that matter, quite frankly, traditional sales, where we reported in the North America a 5% increase.","So, we believe that the equipment market is quite robust. We believe our backlog is solid. And so we are optimistic about the equipment market in general in North America, and for that matter, globally. And we believe that the consumable market is stable, and I think, should be judged over a few quarters and not necessarily one quarter.","Nathan Rich","That's helpful. And Steve, maybe just going back to a previous question. As we think about the outlook versus the North America market, I think that you guys typically try to grow above the market each year. It seems like you kind of expect a continuation of the end market trends that we've been seeing.","How should we think about the loss of the large DSO customers that you called out late last year impacting the growth in that business? And kind of when we put it all together, can you kind of help kind of frame how you're thinking about growth in the North American market for 2020?","Steven Paladino","Yes, I think when we report, we'll probably give more detail on that because I think it would be difficult for us, although not impossible, but difficult to say we're going to gain market share, including the loss of that one customer. I think, really, our goal would be -- that may be too optimistic and that the market share gains would be excluding the impact of that one particular customer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sarah James, Piper Sandler.","Sarah James","Thank you. So, you guys have talked about this being a big couple of years coming up for equipment innovation, I think, from multiple manufacturers. Can you provide any more details on that? And how do you think about incorporating that into your sales guidance? Thanks.","Steven Paladino","Sure. So, we're hopeful that there's some upside because of new products coming into the market. We don't specifically have that built into our guidance because it's difficult to estimate the timing of when those products come into the market and what traction -- how quickly they'll get traction. But for example, one of the product categories that we saw some nice growth in Q4 in was lasers.","Lasers are still a relatively new technology even though lasers have been out for a long time. The adoption of lasers in the dental market is still relatively low. So, from that perspective, it's a newer product. And it does have merit; it can do certain procedures quicker as well as less pain to the patient. So, that's one good example, but it does take time.","The dental market does tend to be slow in adopting new technologies and slow in adopting new equipment. Our equipment sales growth was not just CAD\/CAM in Q4. Yes, it was led by CAD\/CAM, but we also had traditional equipment growth, we also had the laser growth, we had some other high-tech equipment growth.","So, the short answer again is we don't have anything specific built into our guidance because it's difficult to do so around timing.","Sarah James","That's helpful. And just a bigger picture question on the renewal cycle of DSO contracts. Can you give us an idea of pacing? Is 2020 a larger, small year? How do you think about the big renewal years coming up for your DSO contracting? Thanks.","Steven Paladino","Well, one of the things that we made a concerted effort we were successful in doing is rather than having, as we had several years ago, a lot of the renewals all coming up in 1 year, we really don't have that. We were able to spread out some of the renewals so that they're not all bunched up in one particular year.","So, we feel good that, that's helpful because even to focus on the renewals and to provide responses to RFPs, if you have them all coming up at one-time, it's more difficult than to focus on a few at a time. So it's also good because the impact of any one -- or any one year is not as significant as it was two or three years ago when that happens.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Michael Cherny, Bank of America.","Michael Cherny","Stan, earlier, you talked about the 10 deals completed in the course of the year. You also mentioned on another part of the call your focus on the portfolio and continuing to utilize capital to deploy, to add on to your existing capabilities. Can you maybe give us a sense as you look out over the next one, three, maybe even five years, how you think of that M&A strategy evolving in terms of consistently adding new geographic territories on -- for distribution side versus other value-add services versus other potential private label products that you can push through your channel? ","Stanley Bergman","Yes, a good question. We actually see opportunity in all of our businesses. If you look at our capital distribution business, there's a geographic footprint expansion but also there is opportunity to add to our portfolio in practically every market throughout the world. There are no massive dental distribution businesses, really, in our site in, say, North America, but there are opportunities throughout the world on the consumable and equipment side. And there are specific markets where we're relatively underpenetrated.","Having said this, we have a relatively smaller market share in specialty areas. Our market is growing. Our business is growing very nicely in the ortho, endo and oral surgery implants and bone regeneration businesses in many parts of the world. But there are many parts of the world where we either are not present or have a very small presence, so there is significant opportunity to invest in the specialty areas. Henry Schein One has huge opportunities in many, many areas for investment.","And our medical business has opportunity on the distribution side in North America, but globally, there is a lot of opportunity. And on the medical side, there is a significant opportunity in investing in specialty products and businesses, including some vertical integration, specialty opportunities as we've seen on the dental side. So, we see many opportunities across the Board.","We're very comfortable doing these mid-sized deals that we've been doing for years, and every now and again, do something involving putting hundreds of millions of dollars to work. But the $350 plus million of acquisitions each year is something we're quite comfortable with. We can integrate them well. And again, we see lots of opportunity for that kind of investment, and every now and again, a significant investment above number. All of these adding to our geographic presence, our product offering, and in certain areas, improving on our margins.","Michael Cherny","And then just, Steve, you mentioned the initiation of a new restructuring program on the -- coming up. Can you maybe give a little sense in terms of what are some of the areas you're targeting as you put forward in that restructuring program? And where are some of the efficiencies that you think Henry Schein, who's always been pretty efficient, can get more efficient in?","Steven Paladino","Well, I would say that a lot of it comes from -- every year, we do 10, 12 acquisitions, and sometimes, you can't fully integrate without restructuring. So, it's not really -- it's -- there's also a lot of new technologies that are out there to help operating more efficiently that we want to implement and that will save money. It will not be focused on any of the sales activities; we feel there's no need to do anything in that area. So, we're really more on non-sales activities that we will focus on.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one last question. That question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. ","Brett Gasaway","Hey guys. This is Brett on for Kevin Caliendo. I appreciate you squeezing me at the end. I just want to go back to the DSO RFP strategy. I mean is there any insight you can give around pricing and possibly bundling value-added services going forward that may have shifted after the contract loss in 2019? Just trying to get more clarity around there. Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Steven can provide further specific thoughts, but we have not changed our strategy per se in dealing with DSOs. It's always been a competitive market. As it relates to particular bundling opportunities, we've always bundled in one way or another. And to be specific, I think, would not be a good idea from a competitor point of view.","Suffice to say is our offering of general consumables is most competitive, whether it's branded or our own brand and our offering of specialty products is quite unique amongst the distribution community. And certainly, we have a unique offering opportunity in the practice management Henry Schein One arena.","So, I think we remain highly competitive in the space and where we have had a very good market share in the United States as well as in Europe. And by the way, in Europe, this DSO movement, to some extent, is growing in certain markets and we remain well-positioned to capitalize on that business as we have in the United States. It has always been a competitive market.","Steven Paladino","Yes. The only thing I would add to that is our DSO customers are looking for not only very good supply chain, pricing and logistics but also helping them run more efficient practices, helping them with patient demand generation and really doing a lot more solutions for them than just supply chain solutions.","And I think that's where we excel through Henry Schein One, especially on patient demand. I think we have unparalleled expertise in that area and some of the other value-added solutions that we have. So, I think that, that whole package really will be the winning package for customers. And again, we're uniquely positioned to be able to do that.","Brett Gasaway","Yes, that's helpful. And if I could squeeze in one more. Just going to the reveal aligner that was introduced today at Chicago Midwinter, should we be thinking about any contribution from that in 2020 and any potential cannibalization of the XLS base going forward?","Stanley Bergman","I don't think you should draw any major conclusions. First of all, the two products have been introduced for about a year on mostly a beta site basis. As we did mention on the last call, we have a number of DSOs for the reveal product that have signed up. I do believe that over time, we will generate a good business in this line of field. We have a good product. We have good offering. We have some very good sales case -- marketing sales capacity behind it.","But as we've said in the past, this is one additional product line to Henry Schein, and we should not draw specific conclusions on the overall impact as it relates to the business of Henry Schein in general. But we remain quite optimistic that we have a good product and a good offering, and we will slowly introduce it to ensure that our sales match the capacity to deliver.","But again, we believe we have a very good product offering in both -- for both the specialist and GP and position our GP customers to compete very well with the direct players in this market. We have met a lot of positive comments. We've gotten some sales, but I think it is too early to add too much to our earnings related to this product offering, especially in light of the fact that we will be investing in sales and marketing in this area.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Stanley for closing comments.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you very much operator. As we close today's call, I'd like to leave the investors with a thought about our business model and go-to-market strategy. We have spent decades diversifying and differentiating our dental and medical businesses by adding new products and solutions, particularly for dental, expanding our geographic footprint, and specialty offering.","Our success is not bound by the growth profile of any one particular market or customer segment. We really have a diverse product offering. We are confident that we will continue to grow our sales, our gross margin, manage our expenses better, and therefore, increase operating income with the result of increase in EPS, all while turning these increased profits into cash.","Growth rates will vary quarter-to-quarter in each category, but we view the fundamentals of each market we serve as solid and some as being markets that we're extremely optimistic about, whether it's the specialty markets; the practice management solutions markets; Henry Schein One; the medical markets, or for that matter, the dental and medical equipment market; and in certain sectors of the world, the consumable market, the dental consumable market. It is our goal to provide continuous growth in sales and profitability, resulting in an attractive long-term return on investment for our shareholders as we have done in the 25 years as a public company.","I remain extremely optimistic about the future of Henry Schein. I can comfortably say that from a management point of view, we are better positioned today than ever before to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead of us. It is still the first quarter, and it is not the right time to be increasing guidance, but we do remain optimistic about Henry Schein's future.","Having said that, there are a lot of variables in the world beyond anyone's control, including the Chinese situation relative to the local market. Again, not material to Henry Schein from a sales and profit point of view and availability of infection control products. We cannot be certain about that.","Having said that, I believe we're very well-positioned, in fact, almost as good as anyone else to deal with the supply challenges. It's just that we cannot be 100% certain about anything. We have been working on supply chain in the infection control arena for decades and have always, in the past, been able to supply our customers with product as needed.","But having said that, it is -- it would be foolhardy to make predictions in the first quarter of 2020 about the full year. Having said that, we stick with our guidance, and hopefully, we'll be in a position to present better news as the year unfolds.","We look forward to speaking to you again in May, we -- when we report our next earnings, and of course, at one of the next conferences. And in fact, we'll be meeting investors here in Chicago in multiple meetings. We're very, very pleased with the progress we're making in all of our business sectors and are very excited about the future of Henry Schein.","Our customers, I believe, appreciate what we're doing. And as I said, we have an outstanding team in place, with each of the key areas of focus being well-positioned for the future. So, as we go into preparing for our 2021, 2022, 2023 strategic plan, I remain extremely enthusiastic and excited about the future of Henry Schein.","Thank you very much for listening to us today. We look forward again to future calls and meetings. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Carolynne Borders in Investor Relations at 631-390-8105, 631-390-8105 and thank you again for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. In addition, all commentary about the markets we serve, including growth rates and market share, is based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.","The contents of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, February 11, 2014. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Carolynne, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call today. The management team at Henry Schein and the entire organization are very pleased that we completed yet another successful year. 2013 was a year in which we made a lot of progress in all 3 of our verticals and as well as in the infrastructure and the value-added services components of Henry Schein. Of course, we ended the year with a strong fourth quarter.","Sales growth during the fourth quarter was solid, on plan. In fact, in a couple of areas, it was ahead of plan. We believe we gained market share in each of our 4 global business units, and we exceeded the top line -- we exceeded the top of our original EPS guidance range. So I think you will hear from the call good progress in each of our 3 verticals and our global practice solutions, financial services businesses, and that we exceeded the top line of the EPS guidance range. We have continued to advance our geographic footprint. Our product offering has continued to expand over the year through some strategic acquisitions, a couple of exclusives that we've added. Since we reported third quarter financial results, we have announced 6 transactions in our Dental business as well as 1 in Animal Health and 1 in Technology and the Value-Added Services side. These 8 acquisitions had total revenues of approximately $317 million on an annual basis.","So we'll report further information, but let me start by asking Steve to review our quarterly financial results, and then I will return with some additional comments on each of our business units. Steve, please.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I'm also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Our net sales for the quarter ended December 28, 2013, were $2.5 billion, reflecting a 4.9% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. This consisted of 4.4% growth in local currencies and 0.5% growth related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 3.7%, and we added an additional 0.7% to acquisition growth. You can find the details of our sales growth in Exhibit A to our earnings news release, which was issued earlier today.","Our operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 7.4% and declined slightly by 13 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. When excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related acquisition expenses, our operating margin declined by about 5 basis points.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.8%, which is down slightly from the 30.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and is in line with our guidance. The lower tax rate is due to the continued implementation of tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rates. Going forward for 2014, we estimate our effective tax rate will continue to be in the 30% range.","The net income attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $124.3 million or $1.43 per diluted share. This represents growth of 10.5% and 13.5%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Foreign currency did not have any significant impact on the EPS for the quarter.","Looking at our financial results for the full year, there were a number of highlights to report, all of which are records for us for the year. Our sales increased 6.9% to $9.6 billion. Cash flow for the year was $664.2 million and exceeded our adjusted net income by over $230 million. Our adjusted EPS increased by 11.5% to $4.95. And I think it's important to note that our EPS for the year was $0.04 above the top of our original guidance range, which was $4.81 to $4.91. So clearly, we believe 2013 was an excellent year.","If you look at Exhibit B of today's earnings release, you can see a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations.","Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the fourth quarter. Our Global Dental sales for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 3.9% to $1.4 billion, representing a gain in market share based on our estimates of market growth rates. This 3.9% growth consisted of 3.1% growth in local currencies and a 0.8% gain related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 2.6% and acquisitions contributed an additional 0.5%. Of this 2.6% internal growth, we had 2.1% growth in North America and 3.5% growth internationally. If we look at some details of each of North America and International, the 2.1% North American growth included very strong growth of consumable Dental sales of 4.3% and a decline of 2.4% of Dental equipment sales and service revenue. Remember, though, that in North America, our Dental equipment sales growth in last year's fourth quarter was 21.9% and, therefore, it really created an extremely difficult comparison.","The 3.5% growth internationally included 1.5% growth in Dental consumable merchandise sales and a very strong increase in Dental equipment sales and service revenues of 8.6%. This growth was largely driven by the Sirona Cerec sales as well as upgrade promotion, and we are pleased to continue our success with this important supplier in Europe.","Our Global Animal Health sales were $651.7 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 6.6%. Foreign exchange did not have any significant impact on the sales growth for the quarter for this business group; and our internally generated sales contributed 4.8% to our sales growth, an additional 1.8% for acquisitions, primarily related to the C&M Vetlink acquisition.","If we look at the 4.8% total internal growth on a global basis, it consisted of 7% growth in North America and 2.9% growth internationally. If you normalize our results to account for the switch from agency sales in North America, our North American sales growth was approximately 3.8%. This growth was impacted by lower sales of certain parasiticides, largely due to weather-related conditions in the quarter. We believe we gained market share in both our North American and International Animal Health businesses.","Our Global Medical sales were $421.9 million for the fourth quarter, which was an increase of 4.8%. The bulk of that growth was local currency growth of 4.6% and the remaining 0.2% was foreign currency exchange-related. Of that 4.6% local currency growth, it consisted of 5.2% growth in North America and a decline of 6.5% internationally. If we look at the fourth quarter, we had very strong sales of seasonal influenza vaccines with $23.8 million sales for the quarter. And if you normalize and exclude the sales of influenza sales from both the current period and the prior period, our Global Medical sales growth increased 2.8%, with 2.6% growth in local currencies and over 3% -- 3.1% growth in North America. We believe that patient traffic to U.S. physician offices was largely consistent with the third quarter, the prior quarter, and we are confident that our focus on large group practices will allow us to continue to gain market share in the U.S. market.","Our Global Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $88.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 8.6%. And that included 8.9% growth in local currencies and a 0.3% decline in foreign currency exchanges.","In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was also 8.6% and acquisition growth was 0.3%. The composition of that 8% growth was 6.7% in North America and a really strong growth internationally of 21.5%. We're really very pleased with our sales growth in both the Technology and Value-Added Services businesses.","I'd like to point out something that will occur beginning in the first quarter of 2014 related to this category, and that is that sales of a specific dental software product will be recorded on an agency basis going forward. These sales were previously recorded as a direct sales. So the change will lower the sales in the Technology and Value-Added Services businesses by approximately $4 million per quarter, again, beginning in Q1 of 2014. Remember, though, that the profitability of this product line remains unchanged. It still remains a good profitability. It just is that the sales now are recorded on an agency sales basis. We will also provide normalized growth figures throughout 2014 to better analyze the growth of this category.","So related to stock repurchase, we continued to be active in repurchasing our common stock during the fourth quarter. Specifically, we purchased 664,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $111.04 per share, which translated to approximately $73.8 million. The impact of the quarter's repurchase really was not material to our EPS for the current quarter. For the full year, the company did repurchase a little over $300 million, $300.3 million of stock, representing 3.1 million shares at an average price of $97.71 per share. And this is really in line with our stated goals of purchasing between $200 million to $300 million per year and obviously at the high end of that goal. At the close of the fourth quarter, we still had an authorization for future repurchases of common stock of $300 million. And we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for 2014, barring any unforeseen circumstances.","Let's take a look at some of the highlights for our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter. The operating cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $274.6 million compared with $199.7 million in last year's fourth quarter. The operating cash flow was a record for the year of $664.2 million and our free cash flow was over $600 million for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to have exceeded our goals related to cash flow and free cash flow.","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 39 days for the fourth quarter, which is essentially unchanged from the 38.9 days in the fourth quarter of last year and, on a full year basis, it was relatively consistent also. Days sales outstanding for the full year were 40 days this year compared to 39.8 days last year. Inventory turns also were consistent quarter-over-quarter. Fourth quarter being 6.2 turns compared with 6.1 turns in the fourth quarter of 2012. And also for the year, they were approximately 5.9 turns compared to 6.2 turns last year.","So I'd like to conclude my remarks by affirming our 2004 financial guidance as follows. For 2014, we expect the diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $5.29 to $5.39, which represents growth of 7% to 9% compared with the 2013 results, which excludes certain onetime items that are noted in our press release. It's important to note that we expect the growth in EPS for 2014 to accelerate over the course of the year due really to a number of factors, including the timing impact of recent acquisitions. And that's primarily related to BioHorizons. And just remember that the inventory revaluation associated with the BioHorizons acquisition will have a negative impact, primarily on the first quarter of 2014. This inventory step-up is a noncash expense and is directly related to acquisition accounting for this business. Finally, of course, our 2014 guidance is for current continuing operations, as well as all the previously announced and completed acquisitions, but does not include any potential future acquisitions.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Let me take a few minutes to provide some additional detail on each of our business units. So on the Global Dental business, gains in North America Dental sales included solid growth in the consumable merchandise category, while equipment sales and service revenue declined slightly, following growth of nearly 22% in the prior year quarter, in the 2012 versus '13 which, of course, made for a very challenging comparison. But if you average those off, it's still about a 10% increase in sales each year, which we believe is an excess of the market growth and, therefore, very pleased of the fact that we continue to gain quite a bit of market share on the Dental equipment side here in North America. Of course, we're very pleased to report the International Dental sales returned to growth during the quarter on consumables, which is a good sign that the European dental market has stabilized. And we posted very good gains on the equipment side and equipment sales and service revenue growth on the International side of the business, Dental side of the business as well.","With the strong focus on delivering value, particularly through equipment and software solutions, we are proud to partner with key multinational dental companies, specifically on the equipment side: Sirona, Planmeca, Danaher. We believe we have the best selection of products in the world, best offering of products combined with solutions, Henry Schein access to Sirona's largest distributor of Cerec and CAD\/CAM systems in Europe. And now through our relationship with Planmeca, we offer a broad range of dental imaging equipment and related software. And of course, for a decade, we have partnered with Danaher to deliver dental consumables and innovative solutions that are accelerating the adoption of digital technology in the dental office including, of course, the state-of-the-art 2D and 3D imaging. So together with these manufacturers and a number of other equipment manufacturers and supplier partners, we really believe that we continue to be in the best position to help dental practitioners elevate the quality of the patient care they are delivering, utilizing this new technology and so, of course, improve the long-term success of their businesses. This combination of providing and generally in an open architecture way the best offering of equipment, value-added services, in particular software, we believe will continue to allow our practitioners to operate a better business so that they can provide better clinical care and in the long run, a lot of these new technology is going to give Henry Schein a terrific sales runway in the years to come.","As I mentioned at the start of this call, we have announced a number of strategic transactions this past year. At the end of 2013, we acquired approximately a 60% interest in BioHorizons, which expanded our position in the dental specialty markets. This is a strategy that we've been marching to for several years now. BioHorizons is a U.S.-based manufacturer of advanced dental implants. The products are sold in 85 markets around the world. The company had annual revenues of approximately $115 million, with about half of that coming from the U.S. So if you look at our position today in implants, you'll see we've made terrific progress in the last few years. This agreement with BioHorizons strengthens our position in a critical and growing market. It also includes our investment in Camlog, which is, of course, a leading manufacturer of dental implants in Europe. We're quite pleased actually to announce and report to our shareholders today that in mid-January, we acquired the remaining minority interest and now own 100% of Camlog. With the BioHorizons and Camlog investments, we have made important strides in our implant business, in particular, in 2 of the world\u2019s largest implant markets, namely the U.S. and Germany. To that, you could, of course, add Canada and a number of other European markets and Japan. And we were comfortable that we continue to grow our presence in a very profitable way in the dental oral surgery markets with a focus on the key product offering of implants.","Both BioHorizons and Camlog will operate independently and will leverage strong brands and unique product features and benefits while offering customers a broad range of treatment options. Also of note, BioHorizons' strength is our product portfolio in the biologics market, which is critical to our goals in advancing our position in the oral surgery field. Of course, we carry many brands in that space and are continuously working to expand our footprint in the biologics with world brand leaders and very, very important for us.","The advancing in the BioHorizons area, the whole implant area, oral surgery area, is complemented by the announcement we made in the first days of January when we announced another important strategic transaction, whereby we acquired 5 dental businesses from the Dutch company, Arseus. These businesses strengthen our European Dental and Technology operations. Each one of these 5 businesses has the critical, strategic -- call that a critical, strategic piece of a puzzle; and includes the French dental practice management software, Julie, making us, I believe, now the largest provider of dental software in France, as well as 4 key distributors serving dentists: dental laboratories, dental universities in France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The total annual sales acquired of these companies acquired amounted to $97 million on a historical basis. These transactions have now all closed. Julie was closed in the last year and the others were closed recently in the last few weeks. These -- our sales businesses operate in attractive markets with good growth prospects and have achieved strong market positions and excellent brand value. These acquisitions represent a strategic French dental dealership adding to our important product offerings in France. The software company, Julie, will strengthen our lab presence in 3 very important markets: France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Each acquired company also has an excellent business and cultural fit with Henry Schein. We know many of the leaders, managers in these companies, and we expect terrific and smooth integration with our management team and our culture. We look forward to leveraging our global best practices in these businesses, but also acquiring some excellent talent. And of course, this will add to our already very strong position in the European market.","In February, we announced the acquisition of Lincoln Dental Supply. Lincoln sells products and equipment primarily to dental labs in the United States and Canada. They distribute branded products as well as private label products, had sales of about $18 million last year. The transaction, of course, is an excellent commercial fit with our Zahn Dental laboratory business, and strengthens our presence in important laboratory market, particularly in the northeast of the United States. So if you take Lincoln and Arseus, you will see that we have strengthened our global lab footprint. You add BioHorizons to that, you'll see we have cumulative strength that we've added in the whole prosthetics field, in general. And so, overall, with our software investment in Julie, we have advanced all 3 component parts that are articulated so carefully in our strategic plan. So overall, I must say, we're very pleased with our Global Dental business, which is by far the largest dental business in the world. We've made terrific progress on the management team side. Jim Breslawski continues to lead that business, experienced dental senior executive. And I must say, overall, that we're very, very pleased with the progress we've made on the Dental side together with our investments in all the specialty businesses, in general, on the Dental side.","Let's spend a few minutes on our Global Animal Health business. This business once again performed very well during the fourth quarter. North American internal sales growth in the high single digits is consistent with our stated goals. And International Animal Health internal sales growth in local currencies accelerated slightly versus the prior quarter. In addition to the strategic Dental transactions I just described, we also announced a very important strategic Animal Health acquisition in the fourth quarter. In mid-November, we have announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to buy 80% of Medivet, which is a leading distributor of animal health products and services in Poland. In fact, we believe the largest and a very important market in Poland. We expect this transaction to close later in the year. Medivet marks our entry into the Polish animal health market, and we really are delighted to do so in a leadership position. Our Animal Health business now has operations in 12 European countries, and Medivet will provide strategic base, a very important strategic base, for our expansion into Eastern Europe. Just met with a number of very important global suppliers of animal health products, and I think our desire and our execution on our plan to continue to become an even more important global animal health distributor is being well received by those manufacturers that we work with closely. So very, very pleased to report again very good progress. Lonnie and her team, on the Animal Health side, are doing a great job.","So now, let's turn to the Medical business. We reported growth -- good growth during the quarter, benefited from, of course, from the strong sales of seasonal flu, influenza, versus the prior year. So good growth versus the prior year. While growth, excluding the impact of the flu, slightly accelerated compared to the third quarter, we feel that the strength of this business unit will be felt even more in the years to come. We believe that traffic in the U.S. physician market is largely consistent with prior quarters, but we are really confident that the investment we've made in this area, specifically around the large group practice arena, the multiple locations under common management-type networks that are now growing and flourishing in this market, these are all areas that we have invested in, and we believe our investment is going to pay off very, very well for our shareholders. Of course, Dave McKinley and his team continue to do a great job as a thought leader and a provider of solutions to this rapidly changing market. The dynamics are changing rapidly and we believe that we are well positioned to help our customers deal with the new challenges and exciting opportunities of health care reform.","So the fourth of our business units is, of course, our Global Technology and Value-Added Services business. Growth in this unit was driven by, as we've reported in the past, electronic services, the recurring revenue, of course, software sales, and the big thing is the value-added services that this unit provides to our installed base. I might add that sales in the international markets were particularly strong. And we're excited, in particular, to add the Julie acquisition. That footprint will, of course, add strength in an important market. And we will continue to expand our global footprint in the software arena. I think we will disclose this, Julie adds about 8,000 installed systems in France. In France, we have a very strong position on consumables equipment, and now we'll have the software to complement that. Very pleased with the performance on our Practice Solutions side: Jim Harding, Steve Klaus [ph] and the team, Kevin Bunker. This is a world-class team doing extremely good work servicing our customers across the board, and we have great confidence on the strategic importance of this business, and we'll continue to invest heavily in this area.","So this is the call that relates to our year-end conference call. Let me reflect back a moment to a few of the highlights in 2013. Of course, we are pleased that we have met or exceeded many significant goals for the year. I think all of the key goals, really, by and large, we've done well on. We've exceeded our strategic expectations, largely, balance the strategic plan goals we set for ourselves 3 years ago have been advanced in a terrific way. Of course, if you look at the short-term matters of guidance for the year 2013, which we announced, I believe, in the fourth quarter 2012. We exceeded that -- the top of the guidance by $0.04. We completed 10 strategic acquisitions. About $300 million of business was added. We did very well on the cash flow side. I believe we generated about 1.5x our earnings in cash, so we turned our earnings into cash plus we reduced our working capital, and other ways in which we generated cash. So overall, the cash aspect of the business is doing very well. And at the same time, we acquired $300 million of stock, all in line with our goals. Henry Schein's commitment to our customers and the communities that we serve was evident practically every day in the business for 2013, most notably with our support of suppliers and financial aid after the several horrific events including Sandy, Hurricane Sandy, in the U.S. East Coast; the devastating tornadoes in Oklahoma; the typhoon in the Philippines; our commitment to various community outreach programs, such as Give Kids A Smile, the ADA's leading -- American Dental Association's leading outreach program; our Back to School program. All of this, I think, fuels our commitment to advancing shareholder value, advancing what's in the interest of our team, our suppliers, our customers and our investors, leading to a very good solid return to our investors now over the past 18 years that we've been a public company. If you look at just the leading indexes, we are delighted to enter -- we were delighted to enter the top 300 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest U.S. corporations, now ranked #296 on the 2013 list based on 2012 numbers. So with that as an overview, we feel quite pleased with the progress we made in 2013, excited to go into 2014 with a high morale in the company, solid management team and, generally, a business that has strategic purpose, and executing on that purpose.","So with that in mind, Steven, why don't we, and Carolynne, why don't we open the line to some questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The North American Dental consumable growth, I think you said 4.3% was very impressive. Do you think you can hold that sort of level as you progress through 2014?","Steven Paladino","I think we feel that we'll be in that range. And I hate to be so specific and, say 4.3%, because if it comes in slightly greater, slightly less. I think we'll be in that range. We did feel that Q4 was exceptionally strong. We did execute really well. We do believe that we'll see a little bit of improvement from the market, maybe at the tail end of the year. So I guess our goal really is to be consistent in that factor, but I just caution people not to really look at it so precisely by every 10 basis points.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. It seemed like your European results for both Vet and Dental were pretty good, at least relative to what we expected. Do you feel like you're starting to see it turn in those end markets?","Steven Paladino","John, I think there's a general sense and, of course, this is a sense, it's not scientific, that Europe is stabilizing. I think no one's saying that we're returning to good times, but even I think in Southern Europe, 2 markets that we're in, Spain and Italy, there is a quiet confidence that we are going to get to stable consumable growth and even investment in equipment. So I think that's a little bit of the canary in the cage that I think is indicative of the fact that there is a sense that things are getting a little bit better or stabilizing to better in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Stan, I thought I'd start with you. Just on the CAD\/CAM business. Planmeca has moved pretty quickly here to rebrand NEVO and change out some software and all that. Could you talk maybe about the opportunity you think that creates for 2014? And then, also, I know you've had some supply constraints on the NEVO system on the manufacturing side here in November, December, whenever that was. Do you have a backlog of orders going into 2014? How is that looking as we go into the new year?","Stanley M. Bergman","Jeff, so our #1 strategy for Dental right now, and I expect for many years to come, is to continue with advancing our customers' virtualization of their practices, in the case of the dentist and in the case of the lab, the automation of the digitalization of the lab. There's no question that there's a huge opportunity on the hardware side, be it the scanners or the mills. On the software side, there's lots and lots of opportunity there, and both in the laboratory -- both in the operatory and the laboratory, and also some exciting materials, I think, are going to emerge over the years to come. So this is very, very important for Henry Schein. To the extent practical, we will support an open architecture because that's in the interest of the dental community. It'll take a while for the marketplace to adjust as it has in many -- in most other areas of dentistry to open architecture. All of our software, by the way, today, supports even our competitors' software interchanges. So -- and I think that's in the best interest of the practitioner. So I think it was important for E4D to add a leading brand to its name. And in that context, in the U.S. and Australia and Canada, New Zealand, we will be marketing the Planmeca line. And in other markets, we'll market Sirona, and I expect that our other manufacturers will all be coming out with some form of hardware and software. We do sell the 3M scanner in a number of markets and plus a number of other markets. So we're very excited. We're very pleased with the speed that Planmeca went about converting the E4D name to the plan scan name. And I think, overall, we're happy with our offering of CAD\/CAM and related software, hardware and the key now is for Henry Schein to differentiate the offering that we make available to our customers. And I think you will see advances in dental and other areas like that, that will differentiate Henry Schein's offering as it has, as we have done for years. CAD\/CAM and Practice Management software will connect. We will continue to invest our investment in school, in large group practice software over the years. We'll tie into CAD\/CAM as well. So overall, the strategies here have been laid, they'll be adjusted and we will execute to them. As for the backlog, yes, NEVO, we sold quite a few more NEVO systems or CAD\/CAM systems with the NEVO front in the fourth quarter than E4D had the capacity to deliver. I believe that with Planmeca being part of the management team now -- supporting the management team with E4D, the capacity will increase. We do have solid sales in that area, and I think our overall global CAD\/CAM business will continue to grow with our goal to be the leader in that field.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. That's very helpful. And, Steve, on my follow-up question. I just wanted to focus on your International Technology business, up 21.5% in the quarter, you have a very strong number there. Can that persist into 2014, or maybe not at that level, but solid growth there. And then, maybe any color, is that some of the recent software deals you've done over the last couple of years? And I guess, the last follow-up on that question, just where have margins -- where do you expect margins to go in the Technology business over the next year or 2? They've been trending down with some deals, but it seem like they're reaching a point of stability. Is that true going forward?","Steven Paladino","Okay. So it's a few questions there. So one, the 21% growth, I think it's a little unrealistic to expect us to continue at 21% growth international software. I do think that high single, low double digits is doable for that business unit. They just had a blowout fourth quarter and was primarily in the Software of Excellence business that we acquired a few years ago. With respect to margins, I think, yes, margins probably will be consistent going forward, maybe with a little bit of improvement as we continue to grow sales and drive business towards e-services, which tend to have a little higher margin than the overall software sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe I could just ask a question on weather. And you guys don't usually make excuses but maybe, Stan, if you can talk about the weather and any impact you've seen in the first 6 weeks of 2014. And then, I'm just curious if you're seeing it more pronounced in any of your businesses. In other words, is it more pronounced in Vet relative to Dental or Medical?","Stanley M. Bergman","That's a good question. Actually, I was hoping somebody would ask that question because I think it is a relevant question. We, of course, had been experiencing inordinate difficulty because of the weather in a large part of the U.S. I think this is the first time cities like Atlanta have had a challenge because of winter weather. I think this will have an impact on some of our sales in the first quarter. We will, during our first quarter call, try to identify that impact. I think there will be a few less visits to dentists, probably to animal health practitioners, perhaps to some of the dermatology-type physician practices, but I don't think it will have a material impact on our bottom line. Of course, it will have somewhat of an impact, but we remain comfortable with the guidance for 2014 that we provided. I think our guidance always contemplates something like this occurring somewhere in the world, and it's just a little bit more intense this time in the U.S. But overall, we still feel quite comfortable with our 2014 guidance.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, maybe as a follow-up. Just on the, and Steve, this is more for you, on gross margin expansion, it was up year-over-year. And I think it's really, maybe for only the second time in several years you've seen that. I'm guessing some of that is attributable to lapping the lower margin Vet acquisitions of the past. So just how should we think about this going forward? I mean, are you in the clear and able to get maybe some modest gross margin expansion as we look out for the balance of '14 into '15?","Steven Paladino","So, John, the gross margin really is primarily related to mix. So we talked about Technology sales growth being stronger and that helps drive the gross margin but, really, I think we focus more on the operating margin. And we've talked about even as recently as our Investor Day, we still believe that we can get operating margin expansion. The way we measure it is on, what I refer to as a same-store basis, so excluding any new acquisitions, which could be accretive or dilutive to our margins. And the goal really there is to get margin expansion of at least 20 basis points on a full year basis. We do believe that going longer term that there's the potential for that 20 basis points to expand a bit as sales growth increases, as market conditions improve a little bit. But right now, somewhere in that 20 basis points is a goal that we think is doable and achievable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, I just want to follow up with you on that last point you were just making on your organic operating margins. Yes, I think in your prepared remarks, you suggested that your operating margin on an organic basis may be contracted 5 basis points. I'm just kind of curious, is that solely related to acquisitions, or is there something else going on there? And then, I guess, the question is at the current revenue run rate, do you think you can achieve that 20 basis points of operating margin expansion, or do you need revenue growth to accelerate a little bit?","Steven Paladino","No. So the -- again, so the 20 basis points at current revenue growth rates, we think is doable. That's what our plan is calling for, for 2014. The interesting thing is that, yes, while it was for the quarter, it was down a little bit 5 basis points. And that -- and, Glen, that 5 excludes acquisition impact. But on a full year basis, it was actually up slightly, excluding acquisitions. It wasn't quite the 20 basis points. It was high single basis points. It was 7 or 8 basis points improvement for the full year. One thing I'll point out that impacted Q4 is if you look at all the acquisition activity that we announced in early Q1, a lot of expenses set in Q4 to drive that acquisition expense -- to drive those acquisition activities in Q1. So we record the diligence cost, the professional fees, all of those acquisition, of course, as incurred. So they're always incurred prior to the acquisition being completed. So we're a little bit heavy in Q4 on those expenses because we did have a lot of activity that was announced in early Q1. The interesting thing also is that when you look at Q4, there was a lot of mix impact because when I look at the individual businesses, Dental, Medical, Animal Health and Technology, and this may sound like a contradiction but it's not. Each of them had margin expansion in Q4, each of them. And yet because of mix, it was down 5 basis points. So I guess the short answer to conclude is that we do believe that we can get operating margin expansion in 2014, and that's what our internal plans call for.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Steve, maybe if I can just ask a follow-up question on some of these recent acquisitions. It seems like you obviously trimmed your fiscal '14 guidance a little bit a few weeks ago when you announced these deals. And I'm kind of curious, I mean, what's driving that near-term dilution? Is it mostly the amortization related to these acquisitions? If we were to look at it x the amortization, would these deals be accretive in year 1 or is there something -- is there a new trend with respect to -- we seen any inflation in the purchase prices for these assets. Can you just give us a little bit more color? It would be helpful.","Steven Paladino","Yes. So clearly if we excluded amortization, they would all be immediately accretive on what people sometimes call a cash basis. What really happened is on a couple of the acquisitions, and most notably on BioHorizons, we kind of had a double negative impact. Because BioHorizons is a manufacturer, the amortization is higher than most distributors' amortization. And because it is also a manufacturer, the accounting requires us to step up the inventory. So really, to try to quickly describe what that means is that, effectively, we have to value the inventory on the date of acquisition at fair value less disposable -- disposal cost. So that fair value really reduces our profitability and we don't get our normal gross profit on that. So that's really negatively impacting the first year's accretion. We did say on the BioHorizons acquisition, if you just exclude the step-up in inventory, which is a total noncash charge, that deal would be neutral to EPS for the first year. And then, obviously, if you also exclude out amortization, it would be accretive. So I think BioHorizons, because it's a manufacturer, we're typically buying distributors, really, is a little bit unique and cause a little bit more GAAP dilution than typical. But we still feel like they're good strategic acquisitions. We still feel like we'll see accretion going forward. And strategically, as I think everyone knows, implants and dental specialty is very important to us, and we feel like it's the right thing for us to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Steve, the cash flow is exceptionally strong in '14. Should we expect -- anticipate a similar experience next year? And was there any stepped-up inventory buying in front of the end of the year in the fourth quarter?","Steven Paladino","Okay. So we did have the reversal of, in 2013, of the increased inventory purchases at the end of 2012 related to medical device excise tax. So I think if you look at that, that's probably somewhere around $150 million worth of benefit. So I would say that we're not going to see the same -- we'll be a little bit below cash flow in 2014 versus 2013 because of that benefit we got in 2013. And remember, that was -- it's a timing issue between '12 and '13. With respect to end of year buy-ins for the current year, we always do a certain amount of buy-ins, but I would not say that we had any unusual activity this year that we would need to call out separately going into next year. So we still think we'll get strong cash flow, certainly operating cash flow well in excess of our net income, which is our goal, but it will be a little bit down because of that onetime medical device excise tax benefit.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then, Stanley, if you could just take a minute and elaborate on the growth rate you're seeing in the implant market in Germany. I know Straumann recently came in with a price cut to at least one of its lines. How would you characterize the competitive environment and then just the aggregate market growth rate of the implant market in Germany? That would be helpful.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. I can't give you the exact expectation of the growth market in Germany per se, but I do think the market will move back into positive growth. And I don't want to comment on anyone's reduction in prices. I will tell you that we believe that Camlog continues to gain market share in Germany. We believe this is particularly so because of the introduction of the Easy implant system. We believe we have been taking share of the premium side. By the way, we plan on rolling out Easy throughout Europe. So I do believe the market in Germany will return. I can't tell you exactly which quarter. It's an environment of positive growth units. And we remain quite excited about expanding our presence in Germany, not only in the implant itself but, in general, to -- in sales to oral surgeons. So yes, and Steven can make some specific inquiry from our German sales team and we can give you some more information. But I just participated in a Camlog meeting about 2 weeks ago, and our team is feeling pretty good about our position in the German market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Nathan Rich, on for Robert. My first question is, if we look at the performance in Dental equipment on International side this quarter, can you help us contextualize this, I think you said that performance was helped by some upgrade promos you did around Sirona Cerec system. How big of an impact did that have in the quarter, and how should we think about the run rate for International equipment growth going forward?","Steven Paladino","Well, we had -- I would say that, certainly, the upgrade promotion helped drive very strong growth. And that won't continue all year long, but we'll still get upgrades in Q1 and beyond. I think, we -- and I don't want to really get into that level of detail, but our growth, even excluding the upgrades, was also very strong. And so we feel good that, Stanley said a few minutes ago, that we're seeing some improvement and stabilization in the overall markets and we're executing well to that. To get double-digit growth in equipment in any market on a consistent basis is a tall order, but we feel that we'll still grow in equipment and we have good opportunities there. And every so often, you get the benefit of upgrades or other activities that allow you to exceed your normal growth rate.","Stanley M. Bergman","But our German business, in general, I think we could say, our European business is quite stable. We're very pleased with our management team, just had our German national sales meeting and the morale is really very, very good. And I think our management structure is very deep, our management team in Europe. So we feel comfortable, and I don't want to comment on any particular quarter, but I feel comfortable that we'll continue to gain market share in Europe and, in fact, globally in all of our Dental businesses.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's really helpful. And then, this one is a follow-up, kind of looking more broadly, at this time last year, we had concerns about the fiscal cliff and some tax increases. But when you look out to 2014, how do you feel around kind of how dentists are willing to spend on equipment? Do you think there's kind of more receptivity to that and maybe especially as it relates to CAD\/CAM, what are you seeing there?","Stanley M. Bergman","I think at the end of the day, equipment is going to be sold basically based on replenishment or replacement of equipment that is not functioning any longer. So I don't think that's the big growth. There's some opportunity there, but I'm not sure that's the big growth. The big growth is coming from equipment where we can prove to the practitioner that 2 things will happen: one is it will be an investment in the practice and increase productivity and profitability; and the second is in order for that to happen, it will also have to be equipment that adds to the quality of clinical care. And by the way, this is not only for Dental, I think the same will be the case in Medical. And we feel that the digitalization of dentistry provides such an opportunity, especially coupled with software. And we have invested significantly in our software businesses, both in the area of the cloud software, the Ascend software, which we're starting to sell now and will make an important contribution to the effectiveness of practices. And in addition to that, we've invested in, as I mentioned earlier, on the school software, in the large group practice software, various kinds of e-services, all of this, in combination with CAD\/CAM. And with CAD\/CAM, I believe, will drive our sales in the equipment area. And in general, yes, we expect to have some replenishment sales of the standard-type of equipment, but I think it's in the newer equipment that adds to productivity improvements, the quality of care improvements that we will do well. But we'll have to prove to the practitioner that it's a worthwhile investment. We're not back to pre-2008 times with these practitioners. We're just investing to change the color of the chair. And I'm overstating that point.","Operator","Your final question comes from Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","James Clark","This is James, on for Mike. Just a question on guidance. You talked about earnings accelerating through '14. I'm just wondering if you can, I guess, elaborate on the magnitude of the progression. And then on top of that, if you can talk, does 1Q reflect any of the weather impact you talked about earlier on the call?","Steven Paladino","Yes. I think there's a little bit of the weather impact that we're trying to consider in Q1. Again, Stanley covered that in an earlier question. While we don't believe it'll be material to us, and we still feel very comfortable with our guidance. I think when we look at the progression for the year, there's a little bit of impact baked into that comment. Really, it's not a significant impact, I would say, that you're probably looking at -- the whole year is 7% to 9%. You're probably at a little bit below that range in Q1 and then accelerating throughout the year, which is really typical for us. It's not just the weather, it's not just the acquisitions I talked about. We tend to, when we complete our budget cycle, when we're making investments in people or other things, we tend to hold off a lot of that until the budget is complete, so it happens in Q1. So really is, if you look I think at our historical trends, that's probably a true statement, that Q1 growth is always a little bit lower. Again, you got to back out the acquisition activity related to that. So it's not significantly material, but I thought it was important really to mention given that it would not be even throughout the year.","James Clark","Okay. And then, I think you talked to traffic at Medical being flattish sequentially. Just wondering if you could talk about traffic in the other businesses.","Steven Paladino","Yes. We felt bad. If you look at Dental and Animal Health, first of all, there's really not a lot of great data on this. A lot of this is, looking at key products that are sold, speaking to manufacturers, speaking to certain customers, speaking to some of the large group practices. And I guess we feel that you probably saw in Q4 a little bit of an uptick on Dental and Dental patient traffic. I would say, Animal Health probably, you did not see that because, again, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, because of cooler weather in Q4 than the prior year. You had less flea and tick treatment so less people bringing in their pet because of flea and tick, but that's kind of just a timing thing. But I think if you had to look at the big picture market, it's very stable. We expect that they'll continue to be stable with some slight improvement going forward. And we're hoping that, that slight improvement could actually be better than that, but we're trying to be conservative in our guidance when we're looking at overall market conditions.","Stanley M. Bergman","Okay. So thank you, everyone, for calling in. We are pleased with our results for 2013, excited, as I noted earlier on, with our plans for 2014. At this stage, we're quite comfortable that the markets are stable and that we, at Henry Schein, will continue to improve on our market share in each of our business units, that each have goals to that. These teams are experienced, generally delivered to the company, each one of our business units, each one has plans for investment in growing their units, each one has plans for how they will deliver on their numbers. And we're generally excited, not only with the strategies for this year and the execution of the tactics in our strategic plan, but also for the strategic future of the company. And very, very excited with what we're getting. And thank you, all, for your interest. And we will be back, I think, in 60 days, Steven.","Steven Paladino","Yes.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"10839":["Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) Q3 2014 Earnings Call November  6, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Carolynne Borders - Vice President of Investor Relations","Stanley M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, Chantal, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the third quarter of 2014. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.","The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 6, 2014. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our third quarter financial results were excellent. And I'm delighted to report we gained market share in our 4 business groups. In fact, each group posted strong sales growth both in North America as well as internationally. So our gains were broad-based, and again, I would like to thank the team for doing such a good job.","Growth in net sales for the quarter was at the highest level we reported in more than 3 years. And looking at the important metric of internal growth -- internal sales growth in local currencies, that figure was at a 7-year high. So we really are pleased with the performance this quarter. Today, we are also pleased to be raising the low end of the 2014 financial guidance, while introducing guidance for 2015 diluted EPS that represents growth in the range of 10% to 12%.","In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our performance and a couple of recently announced developments. But first, Steven will review our quarterly financial results. So Steven, please provide the details.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. I'm also very pleased to report excellent results for the third quarter of 2014. As we begin, I'd like to note that the prior year results for the third quarter included certain onetime items that have a net positive impact on our GAAP results of $0.01 per diluted share. And when we exclude those items from our commentary in order to provide better analytics, we'll refer to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS.","So turning to our Q3 results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 27, 2014, were $2.6 billion, reflecting an 11.7% increase compared with the third quarter of 2013. This consisted of 10.9% growth in local currencies and 0.8% growth related to foreign currency exchange.","In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.4%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 4.5%. You could find all of the details on our sales growth contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued earlier this morning.","Our operating margin for the third quarter of 2014 was 6.6%. That's a decline of 20 basis points compared with the prior year. However, when excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, our operating margin was essentially unchanged or flat compared to the prior year.","We look at our effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 30.0%, and that compares slightly down from 30.1% in the third quarter of 2013. Note that, that excludes the benefit -- the onetime benefit of the overseas tax adjustment in the prior year. The lower tax rate is due to continued implementation of tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rates. We expect fourth quarter effective tax rate to be similar in that 30% range for fourth quarter.","Our net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter was $114.8 million or $1.34 per diluted share. This represents growth of 7.8% and 9.8%, respectively, compared with the third quarter of 2013 on a non-GAAP basis. Again, you could see details to this on Exhibit B of our news release that was issued this morning.","Foreign currency exchange rates did not have any material impact on EPS for us during the quarter. In fact, the rates were relatively consistent for the Q3 last year on an average basis versus Q3 this year.","Let me now provide some detail on sales results for the third quarter. Dental sales for the third quarter of 2014 increased 9.7% to $1.3 billion. This 9.7% growth consisted of 9.4% growth in local currencies and a 0.3% gain related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 4.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 4.6%, and that's primarily related to the BioHorizons acquisition and the Arseus acquisition.","If we look at that 4.8% internal growth in local currencies, 5.5% was in North America and 3.7% was in International Dental sales. I'll give you now some additional detail behind each of the North American and International numbers. The 5.5% internal growth in local currencies for North America included 5.6% growth in Dental consumable merchandise and 5.2% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues.","The 3.7% constant currency internal growth in International consisted of 3.2% growth in Dental consumable merchandise and 4.9% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. So you can see both domestically and internationally on consumables and equipment, we had very strong sales growth across the board.","Animal Health sales were $758 million in the third quarter, which was an increase of 18%. This included growth of 15.9% in local currencies and 2.1% related to foreign currency exchange. Our internal sales in constant currencies grew 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 7.8%, and that's primarily related to the SmartPak acquisition in the United States and Medivet in Poland. Of that 8.1% internal growth in local currencies, North America contributed 10.9% growth and International contributed 5.6% growth.","We still have the normalizing impact in the U.S. Animal Health business. And if you normalize for the impact of certain products switching from agency sales to standard sales, our North American sales growth was slightly less than the reported sales growth and was 9.6%, still a very strong number.","Medical sales were $480.3 million in the third quarter, an increase of 8.0%. Foreign exchange did not have any impact on our sales growth for the quarter. And the sales growth was pretty consistent with 8% growth in North America and 8.1% growth internationally, both in constant currencies.","We did have good sales of the seasonal influenza vaccines that we sell. For the quarter, we sold $62 million. That compares to $52 million in the prior year's third quarter. That's about 6.8 million doses of flu vaccine that we sold. And through yesterday, we have sold approximately or just about 9 million doses, which represents essentially all of the season's supply. If you exclude sales of flu vaccines from both periods, we still have very strong medical sales growth for the quarter, and that growth was 6.8% and 6.7% in constant currencies. So we continue to remain confident that our strategy of focusing on large group practices continue to result in market share gains.","If you look at Technology and Value-Added sales, they were $87.1 million for the quarter, which was an increase of 10.4%. That includes 9.5% growth in local currencies and 0.9% growth related to foreign exchange. And the internal growth of that constant currency growth was 6.5%; and acquisition, an additional 3%.","If we break out between North America and International, that 6.5% constant currency internal growth was 5.4% in North America and 13.4% internationally. Remember that we also have a normalization adjustment related to a switch of a dental software product to agency sales. This occurred at the beginning of the first quarter, so we'll annualize by the end of this year.","But if you adjust for that, the normalized sales growth in North America was 11.4% in our Technology and Value-Added Services business. So we're very pleased with this double-digit normalized sales growth in Technology, and we saw particular strength both in new software sales and financial services.","We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. Specifically, we repurchased 633,000 shares at an average price of $118.32, which translated to approximately $75 million of purchase price. This current repurchase of shares in the third quarter was not material to our EPS. At the close of the quarter, we have about $74 million remaining authorized on our share repurchase program. And we remain committed to our goal of somewhere between $200 million and $300 million of stock repurchases for the full calendar year 2014.","If you look at our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong cash flow for the quarter, $174.5 million, up from $152.8 million last year. We believe we'll continue to get good strength -- strong cash flow in the fourth quarter.","Some metrics on our working capital. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 41.2 days, which is a slight improvement over the 41.6 days last year. And inventory turns were relatively constant, 6.0 turns in the current year, down a little bit from the 6.2 turns in the prior year's quarter.","I'll also point out that as we previously announced, we have taken advantage of some favorable market conditions in the credit markets and we extended several of our credit facilities at attractive rates. So this, in combination with our strong cash flow, provides us with additional flexibility to take advantage of both acquisition as well as share repurchase opportunities and any other corporate opportunities that may arise. So we feel these facilities will continue to support our long-term internal and acquisition growth and continue to maintain a strong capital structure.","So I'll conclude my remarks by discussing our 2014 and '15 financial guidance. For 2014, we are again raising the low end of our guidance range and now expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $5.36 to $5.39. On a full year basis, this represents growth of 8% to 9% versus the prior year, which excludes certain onetime items and compares to the previously issued guidance, which the low end of the range was $5.33. So we raised the low end of the range by $0.03 per share. And as always, our guidance is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but not any potential future acquisitions.","Turning to next year. We did introduce 2015 financial guidance as follows: we expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $5.90 to $6 per share. That represents 10% to 12% growth compared with the midpoint of our newly issued 2014 guidance. I think it's important to note that the 2015 guidance excludes certain restructuring costs related to a planned cost corporate initiative regarding rationalizing some of the company's operations that will provide significant expense efficiencies.","So we believe it's important to reduce some of our cost structure at this time so we can continue to invest in new initiatives to drive future growth going forward. And as you know, Henry Schein has had a history of innovation and change, and this is just another continuation of that theme.","We expect that this initiative, although it's still in the planning stage, to continue through most of 2015. And we expect the onetime cost related to this to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million pretax or $0.29 to $0.33 per diluted share. And as we have done in the past, we will show these items as restructuring costs on the face of our P&L. And when we report results, we'll show adjusted EPS excluding that because that's the way our guidance was developed.","2015 guidance, as is all of our guidance again is for continuing operations, but not any future acquisitions or other activities. And I'd also like to point out a couple of things related to our guidance. We have incorporated the continued strength of the U.S. dollar especially versus the euro. As you know, about 20% of our sales are euro-denominated, and we don't hedge any foreign currency translation impact. And of course, given where the euro is today to the dollar, we do expect next year that this will be a headwind and we have incorporated that into our 2015 guidance that we introduced today.","So let me now turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you very much, Steven. I'm sure -- quite sure our investors understand that this is a time of rapid change in the markets that we serve, whether related to health care reform and indeed, the reform of the health care reform that we expect to see with the change in the Senate, demographic shifts or customer consolidation.","It is important that we position ourselves as a company to serve our markets through these transitions. Henry Schein has a long history of reinvention, and we know from our experience that companies adapting to market changes are the ones that thrive.","As we look back on our 2012 -- January 2012 to 2014, December 2014 strategic plan, which sunsets at the end of this quarter, our accomplishments, we believe, are quite clear. We expanded our operations to 5 new countries. We successfully integrated 30 companies and added more than 2,000 Team Schein Members.","We reorganized to align our interests among our 3 global vertical groups. Going into the strategic plan, we were globally or geographically organized. We are now organized into a Dental group, a Global Dental group, a Global Medical group, which is primarily U.S.-based, and a Global Animal Health group with a strong horizontal-factor solutions business, in other words, software business and a strong horizontal Technology business. In addition to the strong vertical Technology business, we have a strong financial services horizontal. Both the practice solutions and the financial services horizontal service 3: Dental; Medical; and Animal Health verticals. This was accomplished during this 3-year period.","We expect that our EPS will have grown by 11% on a compounded annual basis over the 2012-'14 period, assuming, of course, the midpoint of our 2014 guidance. We have taken into account the fourth quarter, which is not done yet. By these measures, it has been a very good 3 years, particularly when viewed in the context of challenging global economic times.","But we must, of course, continue to look ahead. Our vision continues to focus on helping practitioners improve the efficiency of their practices so that they can focus on providing the best care to their patients.","As we enter 2015 and the 2015-2017 strategic planning period, the next period being January 1, 2015 and ending in December 2017, we recognize that we need to optimize our operations in order to fund new initiatives to drive future growth. We believe that the planned restructuring that Steven discussed earlier will provide the impetus to achieve the strategic priorities we have identified for 2015 to 2017.","These priorities include: investing in growth opportunities that allow us to enter new product categories, all related to our customer businesses. In other words, we will remain focused on dental, the physician marketplace and the veterinary marketplace and at the same time, we plan on expanding into additional geographic markets. We will work on enhancing operating margin by improved operational inefficiencies and establishing a sustainable optimization process. We will also be identifying and investing in up- and mid-market clients, these are the midsized practices that are rapidly emerging and, of course, the very large practices, through targeted cross-platform products and services. We will be strengthening our competitive position by securing more exclusive products that are a strategic fit. And we will be targeting specialists and practitioners in alternate care settings. Developing new technology solutions as well as other value-added services that improve the customer experience and expand our position in the marketplace will also be a priority and need funding. And finally, we will continue to invest in the development of our #1 asset, Team Schein.","I'm confident that we have the right plans in place to lay the foundation for continued business execution, which in turn will allow us to continue to deliver the value that our shareholders have come to expect from Henry Schein. This program that we've had in place, really for decades now and, of course, quite transparent to our investors since we went public exactly 19 years ago, has worked well for us. 3-year strategic plans, realigning our resources, we have done this successfully in all but 1 year when we delayed it because of the 2008 beginning of the recession. But other than that 1 year, we have had this process in place, and it has worked very, very successfully for the company.","Before I begin my review on the business groups, I note that there has been some concern recently voiced about the slowing growth in certain European markets and challenges in others. As I'll discuss in a moment, each of our groups has significant overseas presence, namely Dental, Animal Health, the 2 verticals, and of course, Technology, the horizontal. Medical is not that significant in Europe, and we don't have Medical in Asia or Australia, New Zealand.","Each supported strong growth from the International operations during the third quarter and indeed for the year. And within International, we've posted steady growth in all of our major European markets. The markets are relatively stable, although a few, like Germany and the U.K., are more in the positive column, and Italy and Spain are more on the negative side, although we think from our point of view, are stable. And France is -- has been a little bit up-and-down. But I think we are well positioned in that market to continue to gain market share.","And now let me turn to Dental. We gained market share in our Dental group during the third quarter, with growth of approximately 10% both in North America and International. In addition, internal growth in local currencies was at a multiyear high for North American merchandise, for International Dental as a whole and for the group in its entirety.","North America patient traffic in dental offices was quite good, we believe, as reflected by internal merchandise growth in local currency of nearly 6%. I don't think we can conclude from that, that if you adjust for inflation, say, 2%, 2.5%, that the dental market is growing at 3-plus percent from a visitors point of view. But we can't conclude that the visits to dentists is growing and at the same time, Henry Schein is gaining market share in terms of units.","Our International Dental results reflect balanced growth between merchandise and equipment, with equipment growth, in particular, bolstered by strategic acquisitions, including the Arseus and Sirona transactions in Europe.","We saw particular strength in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. As we continue to expand our global footprint, we were delighted to recently announce our entry into Japan, which is the world's second-largest dental market. With our noncontrolling investment in Iwase Dental Supply, Henry Schein now operates in 28 countries.","Iwase is the #3 dental dealer in Japan, primarily services the Tokyo region with dental consumables, implants and equipment. Sales for the year 2013 were about $190 million. Iwase is a family-run business that is led by Kenichiro Iwase, Ken, the third-generation family member to run the company.","Mr. Iwase has been named Managing Director of Henry Schein Japan, and under his leadership, we look forward to pursuing additional partnerships in the Japanese market. The model we are following in Japan is similar to all the other markets that we've entered into over the years, where we've always sought top-notch professionals that understand the particular market -- dental, medical, or vet -- and have an entrepreneurial bent and would work well with our senior management. And this is definitely the case with Ken.","We are excited about the opportunities in Japan, which has about 68,000 dentists serving a market being fueled by an aging population and, of course, increasing demand for elective procedures.","Let me now turn to the Animal Health side, where we also gained market share in this group, with strong internal growth in local currencies bolstered by strategic acquisitions. Internal sales growth in local currencies was at a 7-quarter high for this group.","Internationally, we saw particular strength in the U.K., Spain and Austria. During last quarter's call, there was some discussion about the decision of IDEXX Laboratories to change from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model for its veterinary diagnostic instruments in the United States.","Recently, we were pleased to announce new strategic relationships with Abaxis and with Heska, whereby Henry Schein Animal Health is now offering great solutions, we believe, and even better solutions to come of a full line of veterinary diagnostic products. Henry Schein is committed to helping our customers run efficient, profitable practices, while delivering high-quality care to our patients who are our customers' patients.","Our companion Animal Health business is the largest in North America. And our customers consistently rely on us for a comprehensive line of products and services, including the full range of veterinary diagnostic products such as instruments, consumables and rapid assays.","The Abaxis and Heska products we now represent are excellent, and we have just announced these new agreements. And our goal is to increase market share for each of these suppliers and, indeed, for the whole category. This is not the first time we've had to switch from a distributor-friendly or distributor-modeled manufacturer to one that goes direct. And I'm sure that over time, we will do very well, considering the fact that we have an outstanding sales force. And importantly, Henry Schein healthcare's Practice Management Software offers robust clinical integration features to connect with both companies' diagnostic systems and more to come.","We are very pleased with the plans that have been made by our Technology group to advance the integration of diagnostics into our software systems. And we're also pleased to be able to hit the ground running with these products and look forward to continued success in the veterinary diagnostic market, not only in the U.S., but globally.","We have some good plans, as I said, and have total confidence in our Global Animal Health team to execute on these plans and continue to provide terrific value-added services to our Animal Health customers.","So now let me turn to the Medical business. Quarterly Medical sales was at the highest level in 1.5 years as we made continued progress with large group practices and the IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. As I've said in previous conference calls, the onboarding process with these large customers generally is longer than it is for the small practices or the solo practitioner.","Yet, while it may take longer to secure these new relationships, it's actually a little easier to secure them, but to bring them on board is the challenge. Once the business has been secured, the size of the opportunity makes the effort all very worthwhile, and we are pleased with our efforts and progress to date. This was a decision we made in the strategic plan of 2011, '12, '13 -- well, sorry, no, '09, '10, '11, the one before the plan we're in, to establish our healthcare services group, focused on the large practices in the medical arena, and that investment, switching resources particularly into that part of the business, has paid off very well as, of course, it has for almost 2 decades in the dental arena where we believe we are the largest provider of products to group practices and to dental schools.","So let me now turn to the Technology and the Value-Added Services businesses. Our sales growth this quarter reflects particular strength in software sales and financial services as well as strategic acquisitions overseas. We are delighted to report the continuation of double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies in International Technology and Value-Added Services.","During the quarter, there were 2 developments in particular that underscore our commitment to digital dentistry and its importance to the future of the dental profession. First in early August, we opened new headquarters for our domestic Dental Practice Solutions business. The new facility in Utah features an innovative Center of Excellence, which is outfitted with high-quality digital dental equipment technology from a number of our value-added suppliers.","The Center of Excellence not only shows -- is not only a showcase for innovative products, but also provides local dental professionals with a modern facility to offer free high-quality oral care to a community's underserved, fitting very well with Henry Schein's culture and business model of doing well by doing good.","And in late October, along with the publisher, Quintessence, we hosted the first International Symposium on Digital Dentistry. The 3-day event held in Orlando provided in-depth educational experiences for dentists and dental laboratory technicians on the clinical benefits of digital technologies and our philosophy of open platform workflows. The symposium focused on procedure planning and treatment, including the clinical and aesthetic results of tooth restoration implants. Attendees left with a better understanding of significant patient benefits that digital technology provides in terms of accuracy, speed, comfort and appearance.","So let me conclude. And before I open the call to -- for questions, I'd like to call your attention to just a few of the many activities that Henry Schein -- at Henry Schein that we do not drive -- that do not necessarily drive top line growth, but are integral to our business practices and reflect our commitment to corporate social responsibility.","In late August, we hosted our annual Back to School program at 28 company locations, reflecting our growing footprint. We expanded this program to include Europe for the first time with an event in Madrid. This year, a record number of children, more than 5,000, actually returned to the classroom with essentials ranging from new clothing to backpacks filled with books and supplies. Since inception 17 years ago, more than 27,000 children had benefited from our Back to School program.","In early September, we partnered with the Large Urology Group Practice Association to raise awareness about the importance of prostate cancer checkups. In recognition of National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we relaunched the educational plan to increase public awareness about the importance of early detection in saving men's lives.","And in October, we opened the Henry Schein Ebola Relief Fund to support relief efforts related to the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa. This is the latest in the long history of relief programs we have sponsored around the world. As a company and an executive team, we have strong ties to the African continent. And through the newest fund, we will be matching the contributions of Team Schein Members to support direct efforts through the CDC Foundation. The money raised will augment the nation's personal protective equipment that we're making through Henry Schein Cares and to help healthcare workers in West Africa.","So I mentioned these 3 social outreach programs because we're often asked why is Henry Schein a company that produces steady results. And the simple answer is that Henry Schein is a company that values our team. It's a company with a team philosophy, the team spirit, the intrapreneurship\/entrepreneurship in a large business, has been very, very successful for us. This includes our team actively being -- being actively engaged in social responsibility together with our suppliers and our customers. All of this leading to good rates of return. And so I thought it was important for us to cover this with our shareholders as well.","So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. And now operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Well, 2 quick ones here for me, if I could. Steve, I was wondering, qualitatively maybe you could break out on the North American Dental consumable side or maybe even worldwide Dental consumables what you're seeing on the general consumable side versus maybe on the equipment -- on the, I'm sorry, on the Dental implants side, some of the other specialty business lines.","Steven Paladino","Sure. So I guess, the good news is really, as I said in the prepared remarks, across really all of Dental, we had a bit of an acceleration of sales growth. And Stanley talked about that we do believe that's somewhat related to increased patient traffic, but we do think we're continuing to gain market share. Both -- we had really very good growth on the implants side. Both BioHorizons, which as you know is primarily in the U.S., had stronger growth than the consumable average growth. And Camlog, on primarily the International side, the same thing is true, had stronger growth than the overall. So we also believe that the implant market is improving a little bit, continues to be good. But those specialty products did perform a bit better than the core consumable products.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. Helpful. And then just in my follow-up. On the equipment side of the business, you have some tough comps upcoming even in the fourth quarter. I know it doesn't look like a tough comp, but from a revenue dollar basis, I think it is. With Section 179 kind of coming down this year pretty hard and you're going to start coming up against some PlanScan upgrades, things like that, just how should we conceptually be thinking about the Dental equipment business over the next, call it, 3 to 4 quarters, something like that?","Steven Paladino","Well, I think it's a good point. It's really impossible to determine that Section 179 has less tax benefit this year than last year. And what will the impact be? My personal view is it will be a little bit of headwind certainly in Q4. But longer-term, if you go out a quarter or 2 or 3 or more, I think the tax benefits accelerate people's decisions, but they're going to make those decisions anyway. So it might be a little bit of -- more difficult in Q4, but we're still expecting strong mid- to high single-digit growth in Dental equipment going forward into Q4. You're right, we do have a little bit more of a difficult comp with PlanScan and upgrades and all of that. But there is life in the equipment market, so we feel good about it. We certainly have all of that baked into our guidance for 2014 and 2015. We really had a very strong traditional equipment sales growth in North America in Q3. So that's always a good sign, an indicator of how the practice is feeling. And so while -- it always could be better and I think we feel pretty good about the equipment sales going forward. And as you know, next year is an IDS year. So that could, from a timing perspective, slow sales in Q1 and accelerate sales in Q2 and Q3. So that's just normal stuff for us at this point, but we should -- you should expect that in your estimates for 2015.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Stan, could you maybe just talk a little bit more about your strategic plan for the next 3 years? There were interesting comments. Number one, just to be clear, should we assume you're really going to stay focused on your kind of 3 key vertical markets that you're already in? And if we think about geographically, what sort of criteria do you use to figure out what countries you enter next?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, John, a very good question. I'm glad you asked it. First of all, we have no intention of leaving the 3 verticals. In fact, we're on -- the strategic plan for us, the whole process, of course, it will expect us to look at all opportunities available to us. But the process reconfirmed our commitment to the dental marketplace globally, not only, of course, for the GP but to the specialist, not only with consumables and equipment but with specialty products, pharmaceutical, med-surg products, software and a plethora of value-added services. So that is clear, Dental. On the medical side, our focus on the domestic market here is clear. And the opportunities are, we believe, are huge. As we advance consolidation, large group practices, multi-specialty, single-specialty and as the IDNs enter the space, we -- the more -- the professionally -- the more professional supply chain management focuses on this field, the more they realize that Henry Schein is an ideal model. And so that's an area to focus on in the medical world, plus we believe advancing our specialty business in the medical world is another huge opportunity. We have done a little bit of that, but nowhere near as far as we have done in Dental, lots and lots of opportunity. And on the Animal Health side, we are committed to that business, lots and lots of opportunity. And in particular, in the non-pharma segment, where we see equipment, med-surg products, diagnostic equipment, we think there's a large opportunity here for us. Yes, we believe that in the U.S. we had a setback, but we've had these setbacks before in the Henry Schein history. And at the end of the day, our model that contemplates a wide variety of products backed up by services has been very good for us, and we will, I think, execute on that very well on the global diagnostic side of dentistry as well. We will continue -- of course, the diagnostic side of Animal Health too. We will, of course, continue to invest heavily in the software businesses, primarily focused in Dental and Animal Health. The new markets, well -- and I think to a large extent, we're focused on Dental and Animal Health. I would not rule out something on Medical, but our Medical team is very busy right now. Literally, the amount of business that's available out there -- the market, of course, is not growing in terms of units that much, and there is price deflation in our sector. But the opportunity to garner market share is really good as well as to bring out new products to our offering. So I don't think that's an area globally that we'll focus on, but you never know. It's certainly not in our plan. Although we have some nice businesses and we're going to put medical products through those businesses, I don't think we'll expand geographies. So the geographies, I think there's lots of opportunities still to expand in the United States, North America, shall we say; in the verticals that I just described; globally, yes; also in the developed world. But I think there are opportunities in the developing world, for example, our business in -- businesses both in South Africa and in Brazil, which really would put out our toes in the water, are doing quite well. And I think we will do more there. It's amazing how well we were received by customers and suppliers. And of course, there's Asia. So new product categories, tons of stuff, digitalization of dentistry, digitalization of the medical world, of the veterinary office. We want to do things to expand our operating margin and particularly, our gross profits, and at the same time, investing in efficiencies and optimizing our business processes. The up-market and the mid-market, huge opportunities, all of our businesses are in -- are moving into the up-markets. And the mid-market is becoming important, and we're setting our teams to focus even more on these areas, the up- and the mid-market separate teams. Of course, we would like to see more exclusives so we can perhaps control our own destiny a little bit better. And I think you'll see that we have dialogue with a number of manufacturers going on. And of course, we want to expand our offering so that we really offer everything a practitioner may need. There are parts of our offering where maybe we can add a higher-quality product, other parts of the equation where we could add a lower-priced product. All the stuff is in the plan. The specialists and practitioners are important all in alternate care setting. The technology, technology, technology, we're going to invest in this. We've got great platforms. We've got to do more in that regard. We already have a lot of work done in the cloud on the Dental side. We need to expand that. And of course, we will continue to invest heavily in the education of our team, bringing young managers on board, advancing our succession plans in all of our businesses. So there's a lot to do here, but those are the essential highlights. And we will focus as we have in the past. We have huge opportunities and we just can't do -- as our president, Jim Breslawski, always reminds us, we can do anything but we can't do everything, and we, I think, have a very tight list of things we want to do and will execute on them as we have in other strategic planning periods.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Maybe just one quick follow-up for Steve. Steve, given the strong top line that you had in the quarter, can you just talk a bit about why you didn't see EBIT margin leverage? And should we -- could we expect more margin leverage as we move through '15?","Steven Paladino","So I'll take the second half of the answer first. I think we absolutely expect to see more margin expansion going forward. This was really a case -- the margin decline really was all related to new acquisitions. As you know, when they come on board, until we could integrate, until we can get some synergies, they typically have a dilutive impact to margins without that. We were relatively flat, but we did make investments in a number of areas. We did have sales mix issues working against us. But again, as I started with, I do think that we're doing good about getting the margin expansion going forward. Some of the restructuring activities will help that going forward. But most of the restructuring activities really are designed to allow us to invest in new initiatives to grow the business, to have that sustainable growth model like we have always strived for since going public almost 20 years ago.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe just the first one. If you could speak to how the trends in the quarter played out in North America and International within Dental. And have you seen momentum as we entered the fourth quarter? And then Stanley, specifically for you, in your opinion, what do you think is allowing International Dental to be what seems like more resilient than one may expect if you just sat here and looked at all the headline risk? And then I've got a follow-up.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. So first of all, I think our view is relatively consistent for the last several quarters. On balance, the developed world economies are leaning in the positive. Yes, there are particular challenges in Europe, but our anchor, of course, in Europe is Germany, and I wouldn't be able to represent it's the best economy we've ever had in Germany, but it's pretty good. And the U.K. is not bad. I mean, there are some -- within our businesses, there are some movements between different classes of customers. In the U.K., a customer bought a distributor, so that caused a bit of disruption. I doubt that will work long-term. It certainly has backfired, and we've been able to pick up a lot of other business. So you have those kinds of things that happen. But overall, I think the businesses are leaning in the positive. So we just need to make sure that the world stays stable from a political point of view. And I think we'll continue to see good solid progress. It's not 2008 numbers, but we are in the positive column. And then we continue to gain market share. And why do we do that? I think our model works well, our model, which is a model of database marketing, telesales-driven, with heavy e-commerce. And then the umbrella over all of this is our field sales consultants. So we have gradually, over the years, moved our sales force from a sales force of order-takers to a sales force of consultants, helping the practitioners with consulting advice. Now it's not absolute. Not every business works using this model perfectly each day, but it's a gradual movement. And I think the investments have paid off. If we didn't have those investments, our operating margin could jump up quite quickly. But we continue to believe we need to put money aside to advance our model, whether it's in the database marketing area, in the telesales area or advising our -- or educating our consultants to be better advisers. And this is all an investment that I believe will pay off well over the years to come. And of course, it's our culture, and our culture drives it as well. So there's very few products in Henry Schein that are patented. And why are we more successful than our competition? It's because of the culture in the company. So you put all this together, and I think it works here and it works in Europe. Of course, being abroad and of course, being in Europe, of course, being in China, even Australia and Canada are slightly different cultures to the way we do things in this country. So we have invested in management over the years in all of the countries we're in. You take a look at both Brazil and South Africa, we had young MBAs that we brought on board a decade ago to prepare us for entry into those 2 markets. And so we make these investments to invest. And the shareholders do well in the long run. The investments are now continuing in other markets. So I think it's the model, and it works for us.","Steven Paladino","Just to tackle real quickly the other part of your question. If you look within the quarter, the good news is that on a month-by-month basis, and I'll focus on the nonequipment, nontechnology because nonequipment -- equipment and technology, there's always a little bit lumpiness where the strength is always in the third month of the quarter just because of the way we promote and the way commissions work and things. But if you look at the consumables, very steady month-to-month, no major, just general -- of course, there's always an exception here or there, but strong growth for each of the 3 months of the quarter. And the good news is, going to date in Q4, we've seen some of that strength continue. So we feel pretty good about the end markets. We feel pretty good that we're seeing a little bit of improvement in patient traffic on a general basis and hopefully, that will continue even to a larger extent.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And the follow-up, which admittedly may have 2 parts to it. Steven, you mentioned that North American Dental equipment was up 5.2%. I think you said basic was particularly good. Did high-tech actually lag basic in the quarter? And do you have the growth specific to the PlanScan division? And the last one, Stanley, you mentioned the integration opportunity with Practice Management on the vet side. And clearly, that's a big opportunity. I think you guys are literally the #1 in 3 players on PMS. How long will that take to integrate with Abaxis and Heska? I'm just trying to get my arms around it. Is it a 3-month initiative? Is it a year initiative?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I'll answer, then Steven will get his specifics for you. So we have been investing in the clinical integration, big data side of the Practice Management Animal Health side for years. And when I say years, I think we've owned these businesses now for -- this is the third year. So from the day we actually made the investment in ImproMed and, of course, on the various systems we've been selling, although that we were selling that we didn't own, including AVImark, and then we made the investment in AVImark, we've been -- I guess it's been a 3-year process. And we've been investing and more importantly, bringing the distribution side and the technology side closer together. We have, of course, had experience on the Dental side. It took us a decade to get it right in Dental. Distributors and technology companies are very different. They think different, and they're both responsible, in our case, for their own bottom line, but it's the synergies that they move to work on together. Never, never easy, but I think we've figured this out quite well. And it paid off in Dental. And in the last few years, we've worked well in that area. As it relates to the specific systems, there will be pieces of the integration brought together, some already done, some will be done even better. But there will be new products coming out all the time. And I suspect that by the January -- end of the January dental meeting in Orlando, we'll have a lot more to show. And then we'll have more to show as the year goes by. And I'm not only talking about in the U.S., but globally. And I think it's an exciting time. Sometimes, you need a little bit of a wake-up call to get you to move a little faster. Our strategies were unfolding, perhaps they were delayed. We were hoping that we would benefit by perhaps even an alliance with IDEXX. But at the end of the day, we've got our team very focused. I happened to meet yesterday with our Animal Health team in Kentucky. There's a big horse show, auctions down there, and I was there with our equine team. And I've got to tell you, the team is so motivated and they're ready to, in particular, to go after this diagnostic market. So we are very, very excited about the whole Value-Added Service, Practice Management solution opportunity in Animal Health. And I think you will see a good plan unfolding a piece at a time over the next couple of years.","Steven Paladino","Yes, just to answer the other part of your question. So yes, as I said, if you look at our overall growth in equipment, we did see a little bit stronger growth in traditional equipment this quarter than the average and a little bit less than the average in the high-tech equipment. I don't think there's really a trend there. I think what we saw was when we looked at Q2, we really pulled, I think, maybe a little bit forward in Q2, which just the timing of when installation and sales occur. And I think when we look at Q3, it's just because of the timing of the closing. I think some slipped into Q4. So again, I don't think it's a trend, but the facts are that traditional did outperform high-tech during the quarter.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I actually just wanted to go back to the restructuring and thinking about the potential for organic margin expansion. I know you guys had reset the goal at the Analyst Day for organic margin expansion on an annual basis to 20 basis points. If I look at the numbers to date, Steve, it seems like you're slightly down year-to-date on the organic margin expansion despite pretty nice top line growth and particularly in this quarter. I'm just wondering if you could go back and talk a little bit more about the restructuring. Is it needed at this point to drive margin expansion as we look out into 2015?","Steven Paladino","Well, is it needed? It will certainly be helpful to it, but it's not the main driver for the restructuring. The main driver is, as you're planning and as you're looking forward, given as Stanley said in his comments, given the changing dynamics in the market and in the world at large, we need to deploy resources in different ways than we did over the last few years. So it's a way of us saying, \"Okay. We need to do more of this and we need to do less of something else.\" And that's how we can balance. But it will have a positive impact on margins. We don't have detailed plans yet, so you won't see anything early in the year -- or not you won't see anything. You'll see some, but it will be more weighted towards the middle of the year and towards the end of the year. And we feel like this is something that's just so important for us to do because we talk internally a lot that we need to invest in the future, but all of our investments can't be incremental. We need to find ways of redeploying our resources, and this is really how we're doing it. Margins, look, we also are very good at, during the quarter, looking at how we're tracking and deciding whether we want to make more or less investments. Sometimes, like in the current quarter, where we saw that sales were doing well, we did a little bit more investment, and you're just seeing the impact of that, which is a little -- not much margin expansion. But that's by design because we are very good at tracking during the quarter and making tweaks in what we're doing along the way. It's just something that we've developed over the years and will hope to continue to do well.","Stanley M. Bergman","The opportunity in our markets, opportunity for preventative care and the growing middle class throughout the world that understands this is just endless in the opportunities. And I think it is very important that we continue to invest. And with a boost in sales, I'd rather take some of that profit and invest it than to show increased operating margin and really mortgage some of the phenomenal opportunities that exist. You put out selling in the market as an example in South Africa and Brazil. Why not expand in those markets? We have -- there's no one providing our kind of service. Why not bring software to different markets? So we could slow down on that, or we could be aggressive on that. And we're investing. And that's the idea behind this restructuring is to move assets from one side of the house to another. It doesn't mean that, that number of people are going to leave the company because we may move people from one side of the house to the other. But at the end of the day, the opportunity exists for us to reposition the company for greater return going forward in a very exciting market.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, I appreciate that. I guess just to push back a little bit, Stanley and Steve, it does seem like differentiating between investing and cost-cutting here, maybe a little bit semantics. But I guess I'm just curious how -- as you think about this restructuring, how are you differentiating between kind of normal course of business, things you probably would be doing on an ongoing basis to better position the business, reinvest in certain geographies, move resources around versus kind of a wholesale onetime restructuring where quite a big chunk of cost gets excluded from the operating results.","Steven Paladino","Okay. So the restructuring costs really loosely fall into 3 buckets, and they're all under the theme of onetime costs. So -- and again, we're not prepared at this time, nor do we really want to at this time, to go into extreme detail, but the 3 buckets fall into 3 areas as follows. One is we do expect to have some facility consolidations in our total worldwide network. So really the cost in order to consolidate facilities, to exit leases or whatever are part of the restructuring costs. The second is related to headcount. And we do expect to see somewhere on average between 2% and 3% of our global workforce. So it's a small percentage, a 2% to 3% net reduction in people. And the third is we've done a lot of acquisitions over the years. And as we look through some of those acquisitions, there are certain redundancies that in order to get to those redundancies, we do need to complete some integration activities at a onetime cost. So again, they're truly not normal activities. We will show them as a 1-line item as restructuring costs. And again, we feel it's important to do now because, again, there's a little bit of margin expansion built into that. But the bulk of it really is to try to redeploy resources, as I said, a little bit earlier in the future initiatives. So hopefully, that's helpful to you.","Operator","We have time for one last question coming from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Stan, I'm just wanting to follow up on some of your comments. I mean, obviously, the company, when you look in the Dental division, posted obviously very strong organic growth this quarter, particularly in the wake of what we heard from the 2 big consumable manufacturers that was obviously a lot less inspiring. And so you mentioned that the company seemingly is taking share. Is there anything other than just solid execution that you could point to? Is there anything going on in the competitive landscape in either North America or International that's kind of worth calling out? Like I'm just kind of curious to see where this share is coming from and if it's sustainable.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I don't think there's any particular change in our major competitors. Actually, even some of the smaller ones are getting better, but they don't move much in terms of volume. But I think we were executing on our plans. We haven't changed our plans. We're just doing them a little better, I think. And I'm not sure if our market share growth is that different to what it has been in the past. We've always grown at -- at least for quite a while, maybe 1 or 2 quarters it has not been, but we've always grown at the GDP plus a few hundred basis points. And I think the GDP is a little bit better in North America now and maybe we grew a little bit faster this quarter. But our plans are solid, the same plans. It's educating our sales force. It's better use of database marketing. It's a more effective collaboration between telesales and field sales. We have unique assets, and no one has a telesales business like we do and a field sales force like we do. And the software is working well, lots of good things going on there, both in terms of our catalog software, our Internet capabilities, the connection between that and our Practice Management Software, the specialty businesses, the whole CAD\/CAM initiative. And I don't think you can look at any 1 quarter, but that carries momentum throughout the business. So it's thousands of little things that make up the whole.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. Maybe if I could just ask one follow-up question at Steve. Steve, as you look at the guidance for fiscal '15, obviously this quarter, I mean, you saw multiyear highs in some of your divisions in terms of your organic growth rates. I mean, how should we think about the sustainability of that trend in those growth rates embedded within fiscal '15 guidance? And I know you probably don't want to get pinned down to talking about any specifics, but any sort of additional color in terms of the trend, the underlying trend or the strength of the businesses that you're assuming within that fiscal '15 guidance would be helpful.","Steven Paladino","Sure. So we are assuming that if you look at on-average 2015 versus on-average 2014, that there's a slight improvement in end markets because we have seen that. We do believe it is -- it has occurred and we don't see any reason why we should see a pullback to that. But it is only a slight improvement. As we always do when we introduce guidance, we try to be a little bit conservative because really, that's the right thing to do. There's a lot of time between now and the end of next year, and a lot of big different things could happen. But we feel pretty good that the end markets are doing better and we'll capitalize on that. So hopefully, that provides the color you're looking for.","Stanley M. Bergman","So everyone, thank you very much for calling in. I appreciate all the interest, the good questions. And we will be back, I think, this time, it's 4 months, right, because the next year -- so this will be in February. As I concluded many of these calls, actually usually conclude, we're very comfortable with the business. The morale in the company is good. We've got good strategies in place. We're executing well. And I think we will just continue to focus on steady growth in terms of sales and in terms of the bottom line, while turning our profits into cash, which really is the ultimate goal of our management team and so providing increased shareholder value.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's fourth quarter results. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company\u2019s business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The contents of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, February 13, 2013. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.","[Operator Instructions] With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Good morning, and thank you, Carolynne. Our fourth quarter financial results were highlighted by strong profitability with growth in diluted earnings per share of approximately 10%. We also are very pleased to be affirming guidance for 2013 that represents earnings per share growth of somewhere between 8% and 11%, in that range, compared with our 2012 results and, of course, excluding restructuring costs. Once again, we believe we've gained market share during the quarter in each of our business groups, driven by strong domestic results across the board and despite some challenges in certain overseas markets.","Looking at our financial results for the year, there are a number of highlights worth noting upfront. So sales in 2012 increased 4.8% to just shy of $9 billion, while internal sales in local currencies were up 5.1% on a comparable basis. So 5.1% is at least twice the market growth rate in the markets that we serve.","Diluted earnings per share increased nearly 12% to $4.44, excluding the new restructuring costs, so on an apples-to-apples basis. I'd like to point out that earnings per share for the year was $0.10 above the top of the guidance range we originally established back in November of 2011. So clearly, 2012 was an excellent year for Henry Schein and for Team Schein indeed.","We also completed a number of strategic acquisitions during 2012 involving each of our 4 global business groups. As well, we are particularly proud of the fact that Henry Schein now serves more than 1 million dental, medical and animal health practitioners around the world. That is a significantly greater number than any other company in our space. I'll speak in greater detail about our fourth quarter and full year accomplishments in a moment. Suffice to say is we are very, very pleased with our performance and we feel very comfortable with where the company is heading. In fact, very excited with the direction. Our strategic plan that we started with for the period January 1, 2012, and ends December 31, 2014, is well under way. Both from an organizational point of view, we are aligned to support the strategic plan goals and also from an operational point of view, we have made significant progress in 2012 advancing the strategic plan. So very, very excited with where we're heading, very comfortable with the direction and with the team. And so Steven, perhaps give us some specifics on the financial side, and then I'll return on later with some more color on the business units.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I'm also very pleased to be reporting strong financial results and sales growth for the fourth quarter of 2012. Let me point out that the fourth quarter of last year, 2011, included 1 additional selling week compared with the fourth quarter of the current year. This occurs for Henry Schein once every 6 years, given that we are on a 52\/53 weeks fiscal year end, and the year end is the last Saturday of December each year. We previously discussed this impact as it related to our 2011 growth versus 2010 on last year's Q4 call. So we have estimated the impact of the extra week on sales and in order to provide a more meaningful analysis, I will be thus discussing our internal sales growth in local currencies and adjusting for the impact of the extra week in last year's fourth quarter.","So turning to our financial performance. Net sales for the quarter ended December 29, 2012, were $2.4 billion, reflecting a 2.9% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. This consisted of internal growth in local currencies of 6.0%, acquisition growth of 5.0% and decreases related to foreign currency exchange and the extra week impact of 0.6% and 7.5%, respectively. Our sales of seasonal influenza vaccines did not have a material impact on our sales growth for the fourth quarter. Please note that we have provided the details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued earlier this morning. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 7.5% and increased 55 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. If we exclude the impact of current year acquisitions, our Q4 operating margin expanded by a greater amount, by 78 basis points, and that was driven by strong domestic sales growth.","Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved by 89 basis points as we continued to control and leverage our expense structure. The operating expense improvement was offset by a small decline in gross margin of 34 basis points and that was due primarily to higher sales growth in our Animal Health business, that's lower margin, as well as some product mix changes across all of our business groups. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.6%, which is in line with our previous guidance and down slightly from the 30.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. For 2013, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be in the 30% to 31% range for the year.","Net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $112.5 million or $1.26 per diluted share. This represented an increase of 7.4% and 9.6%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. Also, please note that foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on EPS for the quarter, and that negative impact was approximately $0.01 per year versus the prior year's quarter.","If we take a look at our financial performance for the year, in addition to the items that Stanley just highlighted, we are pleased to have achieved an increase in operating income of nearly 9%, an expansion of our operating margin of 27 basis points, which excludes restructuring costs, and 41 basis points on a full year basis, also excluding the impact of acquisitions during 2012, the first year acquisition. This margin expansion is in line with our stated corporate goals.","I'd also like to point out, we achieved our stated goal of operating cash flow for the year in excess of bottom line net income and that was despite approximately $150 million of forward inventory buy-ins that we did during -- end of Q3 and beginning of Q4, which was in advance of potential price increases related to the medical device excise tax, which became effective on January 1.","So now I'd like to provide some detail on our sales results for the fourth quarter. Our Global Dental sales for the fourth quarter were -- showed a decline of 2.4% to $1.3 billion. The components are internal growth in local currencies, an increase of 3.6%; acquisition growth, 2.6%; offset by decreases related to foreign currency exchange; and the extra week impact of 0.9% and 7.7%, respectively. Our overall dental sales growth in local currencies continued to exceed our estimates for what the market growth was. The 3.6% internal sales growth in local currencies in our Global Dental business is comprised of 7% growth in North America and a decline of 1.5% in the international markets.","Let me now discuss some detail behind both of those figures. The 7% North American growth included 0.9% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise products and 21.9% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. Our equipment growth in the North American Dental market continued to be very broad-based and have particular strength in sales of both traditional equipment and CAD\/CAM products. The 1.5% decline in our International Dental markets included growth of 2.2% in consumable merchandise and a 9.2% decline in dental equipment sales and service revenues. The decline in equipment sales in our international markets reflected economic challenges in some markets in Europe, as well as Australia. We also believe that equipment sales were negatively impacted in Germany because of the timing of the IDS trade show in Cologne, which is at the end of Q1.","Our Global Animal Health sales were $611.2 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 16.1%, and this included internal growth in local currencies of 10.6%, acquisition growth of 13.7% and decreases related to foreign exchange and the extra week impact of 0.3% and 7.9%, respectively. This 10.6% internal growth in local currencies included 18.4% growth in the North American market and 3.1% growth in our international markets. The North America growth was primarily driven by sales of parasiticides, as well as certain vaccines. Again, we believe we continue to gain market share in the Global Animal Health business unit.","Our Global Medical sales were $402.4 million in the fourth quarter, which was an increase of 1.1%. This consisted of internal growth in local currencies of 6.9%, acquisition growth of 1.4% and decreases related to foreign exchange and the impact of the extra week of 0.3% and 6.9%, respectively. The 6.9% internal growth in local currencies was comprised of 7.2% growth in our North American market and 2.9% growth internationally. Here also we believe we continue to gain market share in the North American business segment, which accounts for more than 90% of our medical global sales.","Turning to our Global Technology and Value-Added Services sales. They were $81.4 million in the fourth quarter, which was an increase of 15%. This included internal growth in local currencies of 13.5%, acquisition growth of 6.5% and a slight increase related to foreign currency of 0.2% and a decrease due to the extra week of 5.2%. The 13.5% internal growth included 15.7% in the North American market and had particular strength in both our technology and financial services recurring revenue segments and a 1% decline in the international market.","During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $79.50 per share, which approximated $84.2 million in cash. So in total, we bought back $300 million of our common stock during the year for the full year 2012, and this was consistent with our guidance and actually at the high end of our guidance of $200 million to $300 million. The impact on the current year's quarter's repurchase was not material. It was less than $0.01 per share. Also, it's important to note at the close of the quarter, at the year end, we still had $300 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. And again, we continue to expect to repurchase between $200 million and $300 million of common stock during fiscal 2013.","If we take a brief look at the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, operating cash flow was just under $200 million, which compares to $277.8 million last year. Operating cash flow for the year was $408.1 million. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, we are pleased to have achieved our stated goal of having operating cash flow for the year in excess of our bottom line net income, and that's even with the negative impact of inventory forward buy-ins during the quarter in advance of medical device excise tax going effective at the beginning of the year. Again, we completed about $150 million of forward buy-ins during the quarter, and that had a direct impact on cash flow. So excluding that cash flow would be $150 million higher. We expect to get to normal inventory levels by approximately mid-year 2013.","Looking at our accounts receivable day sales outstanding, they were 38.9 days for the quarter. That's down slightly from 39.3 days last year. Our full year basis DSO was 39.8 days and that's also down slightly from 40.6 days last year. Our inventory turns for the fourth quarter was 6.1 turns. That's compared to 6.8 turns last year. On a full year basis, they were 6.2 turns and that compares to 6.7 turns last year. Again, inventory turns were negatively impacted by that forward buy-in of $150 million during the quarter.","Capital expenditures for the year of 2012 were $51 million. We expect CapEx for 2013 to be approximately $60 million to $65 million, and this increases primarily because of an increase of a new facility that we expect to bring online in the United Kingdom, and that's approximately $15 million.","I would like to conclude my remarks by affirming our 2013 financial guidance as follows: For 2013, we expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $4.81 to $4.91, which represents an 8% to 11% growth compared with our 2012 results. It's also important to note that we expect our EPS growth during the year to accelerate over the course of the year.","At the end of the first quarter of 2013, we mentioned in our press release that we intend to refinance our debt related to the Butler Schein Animal Health transaction a couple of years ago. This refinancing is expected to reduce our overall interest expense and improve cash flow, and we expect it to be accretive by between $0.02 and $0.03 on an annualized basis. That's dependent on when we lock in rates and that's still something that we'll do later in this quarter. As part of this refinancing, there is a one-time noncash charge of approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share and that -- our guidance excludes that one-time nonrecurring charge. Also, as always, our guidance is for continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any future acquisitions.","Lastly, it's important to note that in determining our guidance for 2013, we took what we believe is a realistic and somewhat conservative view of foreign currency exchange rates and we assumed that there would be continued economic challenges in some parts of the European Union and, therefore, we're hoping to have a slight conservative bias to our guidance because of those uncertainties. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Let me review with you some highlights from the quarter and the year for each of our 4 global business groups. So starting with the dental group. We are delighted to report continued strength in our North American Dental equipment with growth of nearly 22%, of course, adjusted for that extra week, and overall growth in North America Dental sales of 7%. As Steven mentioned, while the International Dental merchandise growth was healthy, a decline in equipment sales reflects a cautious spending environment in much of Europe, in particular in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as some weakness in Australia. Having said this, we are quite excited about the IDS meeting, which takes place at the end of this quarter. And as we know from historical purchasing patterns, we tend to have a depressed fourth quarter and first quarter in equipment sales in the year of the IDS. That's the fourth quarter of the year before and the first quarter of the IDS. So, hopefully, and we anticipate a far more robust second quarter European and particularly German equipment sales as a result of the IDS meeting, which again takes place at the end of this quarter. We did kick off 2013 with our Annual Dental Field Management Meeting in the first quarter of January. More than 170 Team Schein dental managers gathered to discuss our dental strategy going forward in 2013. At that meeting, I took the opportunity to introduce some company themes for 2013 and beyond, all based on our strategic plans -- our strategic plan for this period. These include the need for Henry Schein to become even more relevant to our customers, and the necessity of change and reinvention in the dental marketplace. Of course, Henry Schein is committed to being the global leader in providing clinical solutions to general dentists and, to a greater extent, to specialists. We are committed to the reinvention of dentistry through digital prosthetics. In fact, at the Greater New York dental meeting in November, we introduced a whole new concept of digital prosthetics. The program centered on the theme of choices that connect. We are quite clear that we need to offer our customers options in connecting to the new digital world that they're going to experience, whether it's in the image area or specifically in the prosthetics area. And just like we are committed to continue to be the leader in the practice solutions area of dentistry, as well as on the imaging side, we are committed to being world leader on the prosthetic -- digital prosthetics side as well.","Our dental team is clear that to achieve our goal of Global Dental leadership in clinical solutions, we need to advance a number of key initiatives. We believe we are uniquely positioned to achieve this goal as we continue to pursue a number of these initiatives. We believe we have more different tools required to advance this goal in our armamentarium really than any other dental company in the world.","So we would like to advance, as part of our strategy, our global leadership position in the Practice Management solutions and Electronic Medical Record arena in dentistry and in providing specialty oral surgery, orthodontic and endodontic products and, of course, the related services that are used by dentists, whether they're GPs or specialists. Of course, an educational protocol for dentists on the importance of dentistry in the entire continuum of health care, not just on the restoration side. And while we are relatively new to the global implant market, we believe we are uniquely positioned to establish ourselves as the leader in the tooth replacement sector. We will have the right mix of hardware and software, and our sales team will be the trusted advisers who introduce and stand behind the digital prosthetics solutions. We are committed to this. This is where dentistry is heading, and just like we were committed to becoming the leader in the practice solutions arena, software, and we achieved that, and the leader in full service, we now, of course, sell more dental imaging and dental chairs than any other company in the dental space. Likewise, we will -- are committed to advancing our prosthetics platform and we'll achieve -- and are committed to achieving and believe we will achieve similar results.","To round out our commitment to solutions-based leadership is a firm-wide focus on excellence in customer service and support. More of this, of course, as the year goes by but this is an area we are firmly committed to.","During 2012, we stepped up our use of social media to interact with all our constituencies, including, of course, our suppliers, customers and various corporate audiences. Our use of social media has been particularly active with our U.S. dental customers, including weekly Twitter chats moderated by industry experts on topical -- topics as diverse as oral health and systemic health, team harmony in the office and office aesthetics. We used YouTube during the fourth quarter for cross publication of our Recovery Empowerment Symposium information. Of course, this was the result of services we offered in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. We'll always be there for our customers and believe that we are viewed as in fact the one-stop shop whenever these kinds of sad situations occur. Dentists, doctors and physicians view us as their resource. And we connected with customers via a lighthearted contest to name our Facebook community mascot. We will continue to leverage the cost-effective reach of social media during 2012 and, of course, beyond.","Also, as we mentioned, dental -- the dental specialty markets are important to our growth strategy, and during 2012 we strengthened our global orthodontics business with the action of -- with the acquisition of Ortho Technology, which has annual sales of about $26 million. With some nice synergies between Ortho Organizers and Ortho Technologies, very complementary opportunities. We, of course, acquired Ortho Organizers in March of 2009 and that Ortho Technologies sells products primarily to orthodontists, while Ortho Organizers largely services the GP dental profession. Today, our orthodontics sales, just of the specialty products, about $75 million annually. Of course, we sell a lot more in products to orthodontists, but in the specialty orthodontics space, we already are running at the rate of $75 million. Also, last year, we acquired a 75% interest in Accord, which has annual sales of about $60 million, and established our presence in Thailand, of course, in a leadership position. Accord also serves as the anchor for further expansion into Southeast Asia, and Thailand marked the 26th country that Henry Schein has operations in and affiliates. Asia becomes importantly -- more important to Henry Schein in the years to come as we advance our market position in this important market, in general.","So that's a little bit about the dental world. Now on the Global Animal Health side, we continue to gain market share during the fourth quarter with accelerated internal growth in North America. If we exclude the extra week, you'll see that the internal growth in local currencies was pretty good. North America, over 18%, and even on the international side, we experienced good growth, healthy growth of about 3.1%. Last year, we made 3 -- that was only internal, by the way. Last year, we made 3 strategic Animal Health acquisitions in Europe and the U.K. Just before the year end, we completed our acquisition of C&M Vetlink, annual sales of $55 million. This made Henry Schein a leading veterinary distributor of Ireland and reinforced Henry Schein Animal Health U.K. based in the U.K. Our veterinary business now has a presence in 11 countries worldwide, including 9 in Europe plus the United Kingdom.","During the second and fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired AUV Veterinary Services with annual sales of about $217 million. AUV brought us a leading presence in the Netherlands and Belgium and advanced, of course, our Pan-European strategy. We hope to expand on that platform in the years to come and are very, very excited about us being really the only dental -- Animal Health distributor with a significant geographic and sales footprint on both sides of the Atlantic and, of course, in Australia and New Zealand. This year started off well from an increasing of the geographic footprint as well, so we started last year, of course, with the Veterinary Instrumentation acquisition. This is part of our strategy to not only increase the geographic presence, but also to add important products with higher margins through these geographic stores, if you will. The leading supplier of veterinary instruments, the leading supplier of surgical instruments, implants to veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom with about $10 million of sales. These products are now being expanded for distribution in the rest of the Schein network. The acquisition holds strategic importance as we have subsequently been able to bring the portfolio of high-quality specialty products to growing professionals, as I said, across Europe, in the U.S. and also Australasia.","","So on the Animal Health side, we've continued to expand our physical presence, but at the same time, doing well on our internal growth and adding higher-margin products such as surgical instruments and, of course, software, which was spoken about in the past.","So now let me talk a bit about our Global Medical group with results continuing to be very good. The growth in North America was significantly higher than third quarter. And our international group, although small, returned to positive growth in local currencies, of course, adjusting for that extra week. Let me point out that the North America group represents 95% of our Global Medical sales space.","Now on the flu side. We sold approximately 1.4 million doses of influenza vaccine during the quarter. I think that was expected. We gave some indication on the last call on that, making a total of 8.3 million doses for the full year. As we discussed last quarter, the profitability for this product line was significantly greater in 2012 than '11. I think we discussed this well over a year ago that we expected this to be the case.","On the strategic side, in July, we acquired Modern Laboratory Services, sales of about $22 million. This transaction supports our continued commitment to the physician and clinical laboratory market, and strengthen our position on the U.S. West Coast, an area of exciting opportunity from a growth point of view and an area where Henry Schein has traditionally been underpenetrated. MLS also advanced our goal of gaining market share and adding larger management through our strategic acquisition. Shall we say, this was an important strategic acquisition as it not only increased our footprint but management product offering, and satisfied an important business niche from a Henry Schein Medical point of view.","Now let me conclude with our Technology group. Sales growth accelerated during the quarter in North America, which represented 90% or so of the group's revenue, with particular strength on the recurring revenue streams of both the technology and financial services side of the business. Having said that, we did experience some challenges in Europe due to some of the economic concerns. We are committed to utilizing advanced technology and software to help all of our customers run more efficient businesses. That's in the dental, medical and animal health side. Late in the third quarter of 2012, towards that goal, we acquired a majority interest in the Exan Group, which is a Canadian dental software company with annual revenues of about $12 million. Many of these acquisitions are far more valuable from a strategic point of view than the sales at the time of the acquisition or investment. We are very optimistic about the growth opportunity for the Exan line as it complements our enterprise business on the software side, as well as on the consumable and equipment side, and provides access to dental schools for special markets merchandise. Exan is by far the leading provider of dental school software in the U.S. and Canada, with huge opportunity to take that know-how and advance it in large group practices and taking the specialty school software abroad. Of course, the importance of connecting software to students in the dental school is clearly an important reason why we invested in this area.","So Steve and I will be happy to take questions. We want to reiterate our commitment to shareholder value by using our strong cash flow to continue to reinvest in the business but also, more importantly, to repurchase shares of our common stock. During the year, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at an average price of $79.50 for a total of $84.2 million. In November last year, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 300 million shares, which was on top of the 200 million shares -- $200 million authorized which was approved in April. So I think we're using our cash flow wisely. We are, of course, investing and expanding the business both geographically and in terms of product offerings through acquisitions and investments, but also responsibly acquiring shares so as to reduce our share count. Steve and I have stated many times in the past, our goal is to spend approximately $200 million to $300 million this year in share buyback and a similar amount in strategic acquisitions, somewhere between $400 million, $500 million, $600 million in total. This will become clearer as opportunities present themselves, but we remain very, very optimistic about the value to our shareholders of investing in strategic acquisitions while at the same time, of course, growing our internal sales but at the same time, buying shares back as we think this is also a good investment.","So that's a bit on the quarter, went a little bit over the normal time because we covered some of the annual progress in 2012. So Steve and I are ready to answer some questions at this point.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Stan, I just want to -- and Steve, I just want to ask a couple quick questions regarding your Q4 equipment sales in North America. Obviously, very strong, and when I was at the Greater New York dental show in December, it was pretty clear that your sales guys were marketing very aggressively the sunsetting of Section 179 and beating the medical device tax, and so I'm trying to gauge how much of potential 1Q sales might have been pulled into 4Q because, Steve, if I listen to your prepared remarks, it kind of sounds like you're suggesting 1Q should be the slowest growth here and -- the slowest quarter of the year and 4Q should be the most aggressive, if I heard that correctly, because currently the Street has it modeled exactly the opposite.","Steven Paladino","Yes. So, Glen, that's why I made the comment because we do expect -- and there's a few reasons, one of which you stated, on why we do expect Q1 growth to really be the lowest and to accelerate throughout the year. Let me just go through the 3 or 4 reasons why we believe that. One, if you look at Q1 last year was a very strong quarter so it's a more difficult comparison. Two, we typically make a fair amount of investment spend in new hires beginning in -- at the beginning of the year for activities throughout the year so they don't start paying dividends until later in the year. Three is the point you mentioned, Glen. We think we may have cannibalized a little bit of equipment sales in Q1. Also, on equipment in Europe, as you know, the IDS show is at the end of Q1, and that typically delays equipment purchases in Europe to after the IDS show, so that will have some negative benefit in Q1 and positive benefit in Q2 and Q3. And so those are the 3 or 4 main reasons. Specifically with North American Dental equipment, we just had an outstanding quarter for equipment sales. Yes, we marketed to the tax benefits of buying this year. We do think that helped us. It's really hard to gauge how much it helped as. And again, when I look at the equipment sales growth, it was very broad-based, traditional equipment, CAD\/CAM, other areas, but certainly we think we got some benefit because Section 179 was scheduled to expire so we were advising clients of that. As it turned out with a new tax law that's passed, it did not expire. In fact, the U.S. government increased Section 179 benefits to $500,000 so there may be some opportunities late in the year in 2013 to talk about that since they increased it. But clearly, we think we got some benefit because of the tax changes that we anticipated at the end of the year.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, maybe if I could just ask you one follow-up question. I mean, historically, we've tended to see some correlation in the direction of equipment sales and consumable sales as traffic sort of ebbs and flows through the dentist office and you kind of look this quarter and you saw your consumable numbers take another step back and we're kind of back to that growth rate in the 2009, early 2010 time frame. And I'm kind of curious to get your take, Stan, if you guys believe you're truly taking market share, what does that say about the growth rate in consumables? And are you surprised at the magnitude of the disconnect, I guess, between your equipment sales, your much stronger-than-expected equipment sales and potentially maybe slightly weaker than expected consumable numbers?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. Glen, it's really hard to pinpoint this thing precisely into low -- into basis points. There are a couple of things that we need to also, if you want to peel the onion a bit further. The weather was -- played a role in, certainly in the Northeast, on visits. This I think is not only in dental but I think also in animal health. On the medical side, it shifted the other way because of flu. But -- and I think we had some dislocations because of weather and also the rhythm of the year end this year was a bit odd, given the time of Christmas and New Year. So you can imagine our management of the business units has tried to figure this out and spent a lot of time on it. And I think the market is probably a little bit more robust than these numbers indicate and so I think we need to wait for the longer, of course, we lost another day of business in the Northeast because of the snow this week -- what is -- this week, right? Yes, this week. So I think the calendar and the weather played somewhat of a difference -- somewhat of a role in making a difference here, this -- for probably an 8-week period of time. But the mood of dentists is not bad -- they wouldn't be investing if it were bad. I think some of the 20-something percent growth in equipment was the result of people being concerned that the tax laws would change, but you don't only invest in equipment because of that. I think interest rates are low. That's very helpful, but at the end of the day, I do think dentists are feeling quite good about the profession. The lab business seems to be okay. We've seen worse times in the lab industry. So overall -- I think Steven used the word solid. We debated that, whether that was the right word, and I'm actually quite sure that, that is the right word to describe the state of the U.S. visits to dentists. Of course, lots of changes as CAD\/CAM picks up so the mix in consumables changes a little bit. Film, by the way, has fallen dramatically in the last year or 2 with the increase in digital X-ray. So there's a lot going on here, but I think we're in a solid state.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Stanley, just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to what's going on in the international markets. Obviously, there's some good explanations of slower purchases ahead of IDS, but what else are you guys seeing in Australia, for example?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I think, let's deal with Australia to start with. The market is quite solid. I think we had a couple of challenges on the equipment side. But, overall, I think the market is quite solid. I think the government is supportive of -- are okay. And I'm quite optimistic about Australia actually for 2013. We just reviewed that particular business a few days ago, actually on Monday with our dental team and I think we remain optimistic. By the way, the same is -- can be said on the Animal Health side for Australia and for New Zealand. If you look at Europe, maybe challenges in the U.K. and in France, but from our point of view, we remain quite optimistic. Germany, I think it's -- there's a slight dip compared to perhaps the previous years, but we are expecting, at least at this stage, a very good IDS. There was some anomalies in the Netherlands because of some change in reimbursement. We think that as the year goes by, that will find its way out. I have to say that the 2 challenges are Spain and Italy, but we are doing very well compared to the rest of the market in Spain and are doing quite well in Italy, but that market is significantly challenged. And just like Spain, we saw the marked decrease a few years ago so the comparables became easier. I think we start annualizing out in Italy in the next few quarters. So although the market is not booming, I think from a Henry Schein point of view, the comps will get easier as the year goes by. So overall, I think the U.S. is stronger, but I think Europe from a Henry Schein point of view should be positive this year.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's good color. I appreciate it. And then just a quick one for Steve, and I can't remember if you made a comment about this in the prepared remarks, but SG&A was lower than expected. What was behind that? And is 20% a good run rate to use as a projection going forward as a percent of revenue?","Steven Paladino","Well, the operating expenses really benefited from the strong primarily dental equipment sales in the U.S. because a fair amount of our expenses on the dental equipment side are relatively fixed. We have a certain amount of service technicians. We have a certain amount of equipment sales and service centers. They don't increase or fluctuate with sales volume. Yes, commissions do, but that's probably the only thing that does. So because of the very strong equipment sales growth in Q4, we got greater leverage on operating expense, that's the primary reason. Our goal again when you're modeling is we do expect to get operating margin expansion on an annual basis. Historically, we've talked about 30 to 50 basis points with the lion's share of that coming on the OpEx side. On the other hand, because of -- depending on how sales growth is, it could be on the lower end of that range. It was for most of 2012 because of lower sales growth, but we still expect to get margin expansion on an annual basis and that's excluding any new acquisitions in the current year, which could increase or decrease margin depending on the acquired company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I just want to dig in a little bit to the competitive dynamics in the medical marketplace. You've had some moving pieces from your competitors there. You obviously point to taking share. Can you talk a bit about, especially over the next 12, 18, 24 months, how you see the competitive dynamics playing out, particularly against the backdrop of health care reform or what that means from an overall growth perspective, if you kind of modeled that already, thinking about it for the [indiscernible]","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I think it's a very good question. So I think from a broad-based point of view, I think it will be more focus on wellness, prevention and therefore, visiting the primary care physician. I think that's the case with respect to health care reform, which will kick in, I think, a year or so down the road, but more importantly from insurance carriers. They're encouraging more of that. So that means there will be more visits to primary care physicians, more preventative visits to specialists as opposed to visits to the emergency room as procedures move out of the emergency room to the office-based environment. So that's one dynamic. The second dynamic is we see a continued acceleration on the consolidation of practices. Small practices becoming big ones, more practices going into IDNs, group practices where the specialty or multi-specialty emerging and so the practices getting bigger. About 5 years ago, we -- for those shareholders that have heard this before, forgive me, we conducted 2 independent strategic studies. One is to determine the best practices that we should be supporting from a Henry Schein product sales point of view. Some practices such as dermatology and gynecology and anesthetics and knees, ankles, braces as we call it internally. Those are the areas we started focusing on as a result of that study. The second was to try to understand the way health care would be delivered in the years to come. And we clearly understood that the practices would get bigger and this is an area we've focused on in the last few years. So our medical group has done well., Of course, some of the growth has come from products in those areas that we are focused on, but a big part of our growth is -- and probably most of it is coming from servicing what we call the upstream part of the market, which is these newer entities, these larger entities, specialties groups, and the IDNs and the large group practices. And we've done well in that area. So we believe in the strategy, we believe, actually, we are the best company to service these needs because we have these very large distribution centers, 5 of them to service the whole country. They are highly leverage-able. The cost in establishing centers is largely spent so the more volume is put through these centers, the lower the cost is, the better the operating margin is, and we believe we have tools, really, that are unique for this marketplace, believe we have better tools than anyone else, and we're very, very excited about our medical business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, I just wanted to revisit the SG&A in the quarter. As you pointed out, this is the lowest percentage we've seen in several years. I was wondering -- it sounds like equipment played a role there, but I was wondering how much synergies from some of your deals, larger deals you've done over the last couple of years might have played into this, specifically thinking about AUV and the like.","Steven Paladino","So the acquisitions over the last year or 2 have helped. Although it's not as big an impact as the other item I mentioned, which is the strong sales growth and equipment, and a third thing is that we have continued focus on ensuring that we optimize our activities, really, everything that we do, we constantly look at how we can be more efficient. But to be fair, the biggest benefit came from the really strong equipment sales growth.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then if I could change gears over to vet. I want to get your perspective around the growth outlook, another strong quarter, particularly in the U.S., so I guess as you're a little bit of a victim of your own success as we move into 2013, some pretty tough comps, just how are you guys thinking about the momentum we saw in '12 as we go into '13 around vet and does the current demand out there support continued similar growth that we've seen?","Steven Paladino","Well, we definitely assume or believe that we will see strong growth in our Animal Health business, both in North America and in Europe. But also we do believe it will moderate somewhat. We can't possibly continue growing at the rates that we're growing, so it will moderate although we do expect it to be very strong, probably will be strongest growth -- continue to be our strongest area of growth. And remember, there is some impact in the North American Animal Health business because of changes with flea and tick products that had strong growth this year, so that will moderate. So I don't think we can expect the same growth rates. It will come down a little bit but it's still going to be very, very strong, and we're very happy about the potential there.","Stanley M. Bergman","Just to add a little bit more color to that, and I think Steven set it up correctly. There were some switches between agency and regular GAAP book sales last year, specifically related to the Novartis FDA challenge. If you peel that out, we grew at somewhere around internal growth 5%, 6%, probably closer to 6.5% internal growth. There was also a very favorable first quarter because of the weather. So I think this needs to be taken into account. Having said that, we believe the market is growing in our sector in the mid-single digits and we will continue to gain market share as we have. And remember our focus is primarily on the companion animal side and so when comparing us to others, you need to take that carefully into account. So we believe we're -- the market is growing in the mid-single digits, we will gain market share and are very, very pleased with the U.S. Butler Schein Animal Health business. It's doing extremely well both from a market position point of view and sales results point of view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Steve, could you just remind us what of your entities flow through the equity earnings and affiliate line? it seems like that was a pretty big negative swing factor in the quarter year-over-year.","Steven Paladino","Sure. So it's actually a little bit of a complex answer. There really are 3 factors that impacted the quarterly results for the equity in earnings of affiliates. The first is one of the entities, we increased our ownership and no longer is reported in that line because it's now a consolidated entity. So it comes out of the equity in earnings of affiliates, it's part of consolidated earnings. Second reason is we did have in one of the affiliates, we did have some one-time costs that negatively impacted the quarter. And the third reason is because of certain tax changes on a comparable basis versus last year, where now some taxes are included in the equity and affiliate line versus prior periods where it was not. But I think where you're really going is so what can we expect going forward and maybe I should just give some guidance on that. And we do expect that the equity in earnings of affiliates in 2013 will probably be in the $8 million to $9 million range, seasonality similar to our core business seasonality. So it's going to be a little bit lower than prior years, again mostly because of the entity that slipped out of that line item and now is a consolidated entity.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Maybe just a quick follow-up. How are your dental specialty businesses doing relative to dental overall?","Steven Paladino","So we -- dental specialties, they're doing well. Remember some of those markets, namely implants and orthodontics, are still probably negatively impacted to a greater extent than general dentistry because of economic conditions, especially in Europe. We have somewhere north of $400 million of specialty business on an annual basis. One of the things that we're trying to do because it's not just in the Camlog and the Ortho Organizers businesses, there are specialty products in the core businesses. And one of the things we're looking to do is to give a little bit greater visibility on that going forward for it. But we're definitely gaining market share. I don't have a specific number, John, though, on how much for it versus the general dental market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, just a couple of clarifying questions. It's all I've got -- all I have left here at this point, but dental equipment, I mean, obviously we don't expect the 22% to continue and you did talk about maybe pulling some into fourth quarter out of first quarter, but we've also heard dental equipment backlog is pretty good this quarter as demand there is still pretty decent. So I would assume you still expect some decent growth in the first quarter even if it's nowhere near that 20% level, is that a fair comment?","Steven Paladino","No, it's a very fair comment. Specifically, our North American equipment backlog increased a bit from Q -- at the end of Q4 so we did see some increase there, but clearly it's not going to be 21%. It will be lower because we did cannibalize a little bit, we believe. But we're still expecting good growth in dental equipment sales in Q1.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. And, Stanley, you brought up the Novartis point, maybe quantify that at, I don't know, 500 to 700 basis points of benefit or so in the year, you could back into that anyway. Is there any chance as Novartis comes back online that the exact opposite happens where if you guys are growing core kind of 5%, 6%, 7% but then you have that headwind of going back to an agency business with Novartis that pulls the reported growth rate down to 1% or 2%.","Stanley M. Bergman","I mean, I can't talk about anything specific with regard to a specific supplier. I'm not even sure -- I think we may even have a nondisclosure agreement there, I don't know. But Novartis is committed to coming back and Novartis, I think, is committed to working closer with us. So I would be shocked if this would impact our profitability and, of course, as it impacts sales, we will discuss the -- any conversion from one methodology of sale recognition to another with shareholders, but I would be shocked if it has an impact on profitability.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And last question, I promise here, Steve, just on one more below-the-line item, net interest and other was up maybe $1 million more than we were thinking and up kind of at levels we haven't seen for a couple of years. What was the driver there?","Steven Paladino","I'm sorry, which line were you referring to?","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Net interest and other.","Steven Paladino","It's a combination of things. The interest expense is down because of lower interest rates and lower borrowing levels. We also -- I think that's the main reason, there may be miscellaneous other games in the -- other gains but it's all very small.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Should we expect that $4.5 million to kind of continue going forward after -- or I guess, maybe adjusted a little bit for the debt refi that will be coming up?","Steven Paladino","Yes. We should expect that the interest expense, just to give you a little bit of detail. There's a little over $200 million, something like $220 million of debt that we are refinancing. We don't have a specific rate that will be lower, but it could be as much as 2 percentage points lower interest rate, and so that will have a direct benefit starting probably at the end of Q1 when we expect to complete that.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Steve, just curious if you've got any update on the operating cash flow or free cash flow outlook for next year?","Steven Paladino","Yes. So as I said in the prepared remarks, our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by about $150 million because of forward inventory buy-ins related to potential price increases for the medical device excise tax. So, really, if you look at our cash flow on a normalized basis, it would be $150 million higher for 2012. We expect that to reverse in 2013 and get back to normalized operating cash flow, plus this reversal. And the second thing that I pointed out, if you're looking at free cash flow, Brandon, we do expect capital expenditures to bump up a little bit. There is a new building planned in the United Kingdom, which is about $15 million, it's not an ongoing CapEx so we do expect CapEx to be in the $60 million to $65 million range this year versus last year, which was over -- a little over $50 million. So again we have a little one-time pop in CapEx because of that new building and then it should resume back to normal CapEx levels going forward.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. I appreciate the color on the equity line outlook for the year. Any chance you could give us a range on the minority interest line as well?","Steven Paladino","I would say minority interest should increase at a slightly faster growth rate than net income growth rates because it does reflect the underlying growth of the businesses that are consolidated plus the new business that's part of the consolidated entity.","Stanley M. Bergman","So, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your interest. As I said a couple of times during the call today and I think you can tell from Steven's tone as well, we believe the business is in good shape. We believe that we have a good strategic plan that we're executing well against. Of course, we do have a couple of challenges, namely the European economy, and we're not 100% certain about the degree of bounce-back in the U.S. economy and that's why we want to remain relatively conservative with our guidance, although we are enthusiastic internally to continue to make good progress on gaining market share and increasing profitability in all of our business units. So we look forward to speaking to everyone, I think, in about 60 days, right?","Steven Paladino","That's right.","Stanley M. Bergman","Because this is the quarter with -- we report just a little later because it's the year end. And thank you very much. Of course, Steven is available to chat at 61-843-5915, Carolynne at...","Carolynne Borders","631-390-8105.","Stanley M.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, Shama, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during the call will include information that is forward-looking.

Thank you everyone for joining us. Now let me start with a review of our financial results at a high level. We closed out 2017 with a strong fourth quarter that demonstrates the advantage of our Henry Schein high-touch, value-added solutions business model. Our customers rely on our team of trusted advisors for the clinical, supply chain, technology and business solutions that practitioners and their office personnel need to operate their practices efficiently day in and day out. We satisfy practice needs through technology as well as our consultative high touch selling approach. So our customers can focus on patient care. It is really important to understand that we are in fact providing a high-touch relationship with our customers that have sustained our growth for well over a quarter century, since we added the field component to our sales and marketing programs.","Before I begin to go into further information on the quarter and on the company I'd like to note that in recognition of our team members following recent US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Henry Schein plans to distribute up to $1,000 one-time cash bonus to certain designated staff members in the US with one full year of service as of January 1, 2018. We are pleased to be able to give back to certain Team Schein members in the US with the special bonus in recognition of the hard work and commitment to excellence. This incremental investment in our team is a reflection of the motivation spirit and value that our broader team across the globe delivers to our customers every single day. Steven, of course will provide more details on the financial impact of this bonus.","So our competitive position in the marketplace builds upon four key elements. Mainly education, service and support; software and innovation; and strong long-term customer relation. Just to highlight, we feel 4,200 highly trained field sales consultants and 2,200 telesales representatives across the globe, these Team Schein members are helping our customers operate a more efficient practice so that customers can focus on clinical outcome. In the field today, we have 200 equipment sales and service centers around the world, with more than 2,000 dedicated field technicians to service and maintain equipment. They are supported by 1,000 customer service representatives. It's an enormous amount of high-touch that goes on each day between us and our million practices that we service, million and half practitioners in those practices. And, of course, software and innovation is critical in advancing the practice goal of efficiency and clinical outcomes we service that day in and day out through our 350 software developers and 800 technicians on the telephones and in the field that support our customers. ","As a company Henry Schein is a healthcare solutions network powered by people and technology. That network is comprised of more than 3,000 suppliers, some 22,000 Team Schein members and more than 400 key opinion leaders in 85 years of knowledge and expertise and solutions. This can provide the connectivity to our customers. We are armed with strong value proposition. We are optimistic about our long-term growth opportunity and believe we are well positioned in attractive growth markets. And we believe in our high-touch value added business model, which we believe will stand the test of time. It will be in the results we are quite sure of that. We have successfully executed on our strategic plan for 2015 to 2017. And now are embarking on our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan, which we will discuss in great detail later. This team is committed to determining our thinking our strategy in advance and has a phenomenal track record on execution. ","But first I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent performance and accomplishment, and Steven will review our financial results a little bit now actually and I'll provide comments later. ","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin I'd like to point out that I'll be reviewing our results on GAAP basis, a reported GAAP basis and also a non-GAAP basis. Each reporting period has items that affect non-GAAP results and they are as follows. For Q4 2017 our non-GAAP results exclude a one-time tax charge of $143 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. And this is related to an estimate of the transitional tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings, as well as the revaluation of deferred income taxes, both that have associated with US tax reform legislation. In addition, we have a loss of $17.6 million pretax, or $0.11 per diluted share and that loss is associated with the previously announced divesture of our equity ownership in E4D Technologies.","On a full year 2017 non-GAAP basis results exclude the same items as well as the litigation settlement expense of $5.3 million pretax or $0.02 per diluted share in the second quarter. For last year, our Q4, 2016 non-GAAP results exclude restructuring cost of $16.1 million pretax, or $0.08 per diluted share, and on a full year basis our non-GAAP results exclude restructuring cost of $45.9 million pretax or $0.21 per diluted share. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business; they enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating of the business. ","These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for information and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures and you could see a detailed reconciliation of these items in Exhibit B in this morning's earnings release as well as on the Investor Relations section of our website. ","Let me also point out that the fourth quarter of 2016 included one additional selling week when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This week is the holiday week between Christmas and New Year. We report on the 52\/53 wait week basis with the fiscal year ending on the last Saturday of December each year. Last year, we previously discussed this impact as it related to our 2016 versus 2015 results on the Q4 call. And the next time that the extra week occurs for us will be in 2022. So because of that we have estimated the impact of the extra week on sales and in order to provide more meaningful analysis I'll be reviewing internal sales growth in local currencies adjusting for the extra week in the fourth quarter of last year. ","So turning to our results. Net sales for the quarter ended December 30, 2017, were $3.3 billion, reflecting a 6.3% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The components our internal sales growth in local currencies of 5.1%, acquisition growth of 4.0%, an increase related to foreign currency exchange of 2.4% and the extra week negatively impacted our sales growth by 5.2%. Again you can see the details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of the earnings news release.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 7.27% and expanded by 41 basis points compared with the fourth quarter. But it's important to look at some additional details on our operating margin related to the Q4. The first relates to restructuring cost in the fourth quarter of last year. These restructuring costs in the prior year basically impacted our operating margin comparisons by 51 basis points. Second, acquisition completed during the past 12 months, 12 months and related expenses for those acquisitions, as well as the impact of certain sales switching between agency sale and direct sales, combined to negatively impact operating margin comparisons by 30 basis points. ","Excluding the net impact of these items, our operating margin expanded by approximately 20 basis points in the fourth quarter on year-over-year basis. For the full year 2017, excluding the impact of the same factors, as well as the litigation settlement expense in Q2 that favorably impacted our operating margin by 23 basis points, our full year operating margin was approximately flat compared to 2016. I'd also like to note that we reported low year-over-year expenses as a percentage of sales as we continue to realize operating efficiencies from previous restructuring efforts and remain focused on leveraging our infrastructure and tightly controlling expenses. ","As we look forward to new opportunities to streamline our businesses and reduce cost. We are currently assessing additional restructuring possibilities in 2018. ","If you look at our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter, it was 90% and that includes the one-time tax charge of $143 million as I just mentioned. But on a non-GAAP basis excluding this one-time item as well as the loss associated with the divesture of E4D Technologies, our effective tax rate was 27.7%, and this compares to 28.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016 which is also on a non-GAAP basis. ","Full year GAAP effective tax rate was 44% and that compares to 28.8% last year. But again, on a non-GAAP basis the full year 2017 effective tax rate was 26.8% versus 28.6% in 2016. So we believe our tax rate will decline by somewhere between 300 and 400 basis points in 2018 and will be somewhere in the 24% range for 2018. This reduction in the effective tax rate is reflected in the updated guidance that we have provided today. ","Moving on the net loss attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. But if you look at the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis excluding those one time items in the restructuring cost, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $152.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share. This represents growth of 0.5% and 3.2% respectively compared with the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of last year. ","I'd like to provide a little bit of additional color on our results. Amortization expense from acquired intangible assets related to M&A activity was $28.3 million, pretax were $0.13 per diluted share for Q4, 2017. And for the full year, the amortization from acquired intangible asset was $112.4 million pretax or $0.52 per diluted share. Also would note that foreign currency exchange had a positive impact on EPS for the quarter of approximately $0.02.","So I'd like to provide some detail on our sales results for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the sale growth figures will exclude the impact of the extra week in prior year and I'll quantify this impact as we go as applicable. So starting with Dental sales, for the fourth quarter of 2017, they increased by 8.2% to $1.7 billion. This consist of internal growth in local currencies of 4.6%, acquisition growth of 6%, and increase related to foreign exchange of 3%; and then the extra week in the prior year negatively impacted sales growth by approximately 5.1%. ","North American internal sales growth in local currencies was 6.7% which included 1.9% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandize. Remember that growth in consumable products were negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to loss of a previously disclosed the ASO contract. And I think it's also important to note that this contract has now anniversaried, so this is the last quarter it will have an impact on our growth rate. ","Our North American Dental Equipment sales and services was very strong at 18.1% growth in local currencies. And our fourth quarter equipment backlog continued to remain very healthy. International Dental internal growth in local currencies was 0.1%; it included 2.6% decrease in sales of dental consumable merchandize due primarily to low sales in certain European countries, but strong growth in dental equipment sales and services revenue at 7.7%. ","Our Animal Health sales were $889.8 million for the fourth quarter which was an increase of 6.2%. This consisted of internal growth in local currencies of 4.5%, acquisition growth of 3.7%; and increase related to foreign exchange of 3.2% and again the extra week negatively impacted sales growth by 5.2%. The 4.5% internal growth in local currencies included 6.0% growth in North America and 2.9% growth internationally. Approximately 70 basis points of the sales growth in North America was from certain products switching between agency and direct sales; excluding this impact, normalized sales growth for North America was approximately 5.3%.","We believe the solid sales growth for the quarter reflects both the healthy end market, as well as our commitment to offering a wide range of product and value-added services. ","Our Medical sales were $636.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 2.6%. Internally generated sales in local currencies were up 8.3%, acquisition contributed 0.1%; there was 0.3% increase due to foreign exchange and the extra week negatively impacted sales growth by 6.1%. That 8.3% internal growth in local currencies included 8.7% growth in North America and a decline of 2.9% internationally.","We are pleased with our Medical growth which has been primarily driven strong organic growth from existing large customers. ","Technology and Value-Added Service sales were $114.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 2.1%. Internally generated sales in local currencies was up 3.2%, acquisitions contributed 0.6%; there was 1.1% increase due to foreign exchange, and again the extra week negatively impacted our sales growth by about 2.8%. The 3.2% internal growth in local currencies included 1.8% growth in North America and 11.4% growth internationally. The North American growth of 1.8% reflects the lower dental software sale and electronic services revenue versus the prior quarter, and was partially mitigated by strong 12% growth in our financial services revenue segment. The international market sales growth of 11.4% was highlighted by strong dental and veterinary software revenue. ","We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter, most specifically during Q4, we spent approximately $225 million to repurchase approximately 3.2 million shares. We elected to accelerate our share repurchases during the fourth quarter to take advantage of what we considered to be an attractive buying opportunity. The impact of this repurchase on our fourth quarter diluted EPS was about one half of one cent per share. For the full year, we spent approximately $450 million for the purchase of approximately 5.9 million shares. And at the close of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $200 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock. ","If we look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $238 million, compared to $264.5 million last year. For the year now operating cash flow $545.5 million versus $642.6 million in 2016. And the low operating cash flow is primarily due to higher working capital. Our capital expenditures for the year were $81.5 million resulting in free cash flow of $464 million. If we look at accounts receivables day sales outstanding, they were 41.5 days for the fourth quarter which is virtually unchanged from the 41.3 days last year. Full year basis, they were also consistent at 41.2 days versus 41.3 days last year. ","Inventory turns for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 5.3 turns and that compares to 5.5 turns last year. On a full year basis also similar 5.3 turns in the current year compared to 5.5 turns last year. ","So I'd like to conclude my remarks by noting that we are raising our 2018 financial guidance to reflect the impact of the US tax reform legislation. For 2018, we now expected diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $4.03 to $4.14 per share. This is up from the previous guidance of $3.85 to $3.96 and reflects growth of 57% to 61% compared with our 2017 GAAP diluted EPS of $2.57. This includes the impact of one time cash bonus that Stan mentioned earlier. These distributions will total approximately $4 million and will be negative in the first quarter of 2018. The anticipated impact to our EPS is approximately $0.02 per share. ","When compared to 2017 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.60 for 2018 EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 15% growth. So since the tax benefits from stock based compensation or ASU 2016-09 is expected to be less for us in Q1, 2018 as compared to the prior year, we anticipate Q1, 2018 EPS growth to be in the mid-single digit range on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. It's important to note that this is before the $0.02 impact of the one time cash bonus that we just discussed. ","This guidance assumes end market to remain stable and is consistent with current market conditions. It's also guidance for continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but that does not include any impact for potential future acquisition should they occur. And this guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are consistent with current levels. ","Last comment I'll make is that we believe there will be no material impact to our 2018 financial results due to the adoption of new revenue standard ASU 2014-09 which is revenue from contract with customers. ","So with that I'll now turn the call back over to Stan. ","Stanley Bergman ","Thank you, Steven. Before we move on, allow me to comment in more detail on the February 12 press release from the US Federal Trade Commission alleging that Henry Schein and other distributors violated US anti-trust law by conspiring to refuse to provide discounts to and otherwise serve buying group representing dental practitioners. We believe these allegations are totally merit less and we intent to defend ourselves vigorously. I'll also note that the complaint seeks injunctive release and does not seek monetary damages. We do not anticipate this matter will have a material, adverse effect on our financial conditions or results of operations. I want to reemphasis that despite what are provocative allegations are content in the complaint; the case is about whether we conspired with other parties not to sell to dental buying groups. Based on the FTC's original definition of these buying groups, let me point out that we do business with more than 100 of these organizations. Even under a narrower definition recently advanced by the FTC, we have done business and continue to do business with very, very groups that we are now accused of refusing to do business with. This is not logical. Henry Schein has a long history of serving customers with integrity and honest. We have earned our reputation for doing business the right way. This is exactly why we have been named the Fortune's list of World's Most Admired Companies for 17 consecutive years from the first time we appeared on the Fortune 500 list, and why we have been named at Ethisphere's List of the World's Most Ethical Companies annually now since 2012. So we are really quite upset about this and really believe that this whole complaint is merit less. ","Now I'll share a few financial highlights from 2017 as I noted I would earlier on in my remarks. We achieved net sales of $12.5 billion in 2017 that's up 7.7% from the prior year. Internal sales in local currencies in 2017 increased by 5.1%, when excluding the impact of extra week in 2016 which is in line with our goal of growing 1% to 2% fast than the end market.","GAAP diluted EPS declined, of course, 17.1% versus 2016 GAAP results, mainly due to the charges associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings and a revaluation of deferred taxes. Non-GAAP diluted EPS growth was 8.8% versus 2016 non-GAAP results. And for the full year 2017, we spent approximately $450 million to repurchase 5.9 million shares of our common stock, reflecting our continued confidence in the strength of our business and commitment to delivering shareholder value. In addition, we completed 14 strategic acquisitions in 2017 as we continue to expand our geographic presence and enhance our product offerings. Together with these acquisitions, together, these acquisitions had trailing 12 months revenue at the time of purchase of approximately at $0.25 billion, specifically these acquisitions expanded out digital dentistry solutions. And broaden our portfolio of endodontic and surgical products. ","In Animal Health, we acquired a cloud based practice management solution and announced the new presence in Brazil among the other strategic initiatives to bolster our expertise and market access. We also helped customers who are affected by the Hurricane, tornados and wildfire while supporting efforts to provide dental and medical services to underserved population in the developing world. ","So to sum it up, we believe 2017 was a terrific year and really solid year for Henry Schein. ","So on the Dental side. Let me review the quarterly performance at each of our four business groups again starting with Dental. In North America, Dental consumable merchandize internal sales growth in local currencies was 1.9% in the fourth quarter, or 3.2% growth when excluding the impact of the loss of the previously disclosed DSO contract. Excluding this contract, the growth rate has now accelerated for the past three quarters looking further out, we are optimistic that the health of the macro environment ultimately will drive an improved end market unit growth in the dental market in North America. ","North American Dental Equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 18.1%, which is really a multiyear high. We are pleased with the strong equipment sales growth which benefited to some extent from a solid contribution from the sales of the full line against Dentsply Sirona dental equipment. But I really want to stress, and we are of course delighted to be carrying the full range of the Dentsply Sirona equipment line, but we also did well across the board with our key dental equipment manufactures including A-dec, Midmark and 3Shape. So our dental equipment business is really doing well which is indicative of the strong market that dentists are committed to investing in and this is an across the board growth in all of the manufactures that we represent. Of course, as now that the relationship with enterprise in North America is off to a solid start. We are optimistic that we continue to make progress on behalf of all our dental equipment manufacturing partners in educating practices on the benefits of digital dental technology. To improve the effectiveness of patient diagnostic and treatment, as well as the productivity in the dental office. The digitalization of dentistry is so exciting and we are very well positioned to advance digitalization in dental offices throughout North America and indeed the world. ","As Steven noted, International Dental Consumable Merchandize internal sales in local currencies declined 2.6% due to lower sales in certain European countries. On the other hand, International Dental Equipment internal sales increased by 7.7% in local currencies, the highest quarterly growth in more than two years. You may recall that in -- and this by the way is off a very good IDS quarter and second and the third. And so we have sustained growth in our international equipment business in Europe and abroad in general. You may recall that 2013, we announced the expansion our position in the dental specialty market with 60% ownership interest in BioHorizons, a manufacture of advanced dental implant that is sold globally. In 2013, their sales were $115 million; in 2017 the BioHorizons sales reached approximately $176 million. Recently, we purchased the remaining interest in BioHorizons and now have 100% equity ownership. Together with our investment in CAMLOG Biotechnologies, a leading manufactured implants in Europe, Henry Schein has built an important position in a two largest implant market: the US and Germany. We are also growing our presence in the rest of the world. The dental profession transition to dental to digital dentistry is a critical element in implant dentistry. So we are very pleased with our investment in the implant area. And expanded our investment in oral surgery section with our Dental Specialty Solutions acquisition of Southern Anesthesia which was added to the ace portfolio. ","We have greatly enhanced our ability to serve the needs of oral surgical practitioners providing our customers with a wide range of products and value-added services. Including bone regeneration materials that help our customers provide high quality care to their patients. Customer demand for implant and its associated materials are expected to increase as digital processes are adopted in the dental and dental experience of patient is enhanced. We are well positioned to benefit from the continued adoption with our broad dental specialties offering. More to follow as people have questions. ","Animal Health. So the global Animal Health internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.5% in the quarter, it reflects our continued very good execution, both domestically and abroad. We believe that the global end market is healthy and we are benefiting from consistent delivery of innovated products and let me stress solutions and strong customer relations in this market. In line with the increasingly value we provide to veterinarian, at the recent VMX Conference in Orlando, we announced an important enhancement to our Axis-Q known as Axis-Q LENS, L, E, N, S in caps. The software enhance better position us-- enhanced the better position to us to offer veterinary practice historic full trending analysis for both reference labs and point-of-care testing. This presentation of pet diagnostic results makes it easy to identify variation in lab results in order to improve care. ","Axis-Q LENS is the only product available today that could present trended results from multiple reference lab and multiple diagnostic instruments that are integrated with Henry Schein vet solution practice management software system. Keep in mind; we estimate that more than 55% of animal health practitioners in US currently have used Henry Schein animal health practice management technology. Shortly after the end of the fourth quarter we closed on a 60% ownership interest in ABASE, a distributor veterinary healthcare products in the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil. ABASE sales pharmaceutical, pet food, diagnostics equipment and consumables primarily to the companion animal, swine, poultry and bovine segment. ABASE had 2017 revenue of approximately $27 million. This investment strengthens our position in the Brazil animal health market which we established early in 2017 instead of Rio de Janeiro, our investment in Tecnew. It also diversifies our relationship with global suppliers and approximately doubles our volume in Brazil.","Now for the Medical Group. For the fourth quarter internal growth in local currencies in the medical group was low about 8.3%. We believe our medical sales growth during the quarter continued to exceed the growth of the broader office based practitioner market reflecting our ability to penetrate large group practices, particularly to our strong supply chain management capabilities. As we constantly evolving healthcare landscape in the US, we believe the right solution is a system that seeks to expand access to care, stabilizing insurance market and advance movement towards wellness and prevention, as all of these are key to driving down the healthcare cost. We had a focus on continuing to offer solution, solution roadmap consulting with physicians to help to navigate this evolving landscape. Also, as provide a consolidation continues with a rapid pace of healthcare system expansion, Henry Schein healthcare services of infrastructure been a great deal of expertise is able to help integrate -- help integrate delivering metrics drive stabilization, improve quality and take trans action cost out of the non-acute supply chain area, and believe that our team is doing an outstanding job in servicing this class of customers. ","So now let me conclude with an overview of our Technology and Value-Added Services. As Steven mentioned, technology value-added services' internal sales growth in Northern America was 1.8% in local currency. This let me stress was impacted by lower dental software sales and electronic services revenue, partially offset by strong financial services revenue, somewhat impacted by an allocation of our sales resource to bring on the Dentsply Sirona business in the fourth quarter and not focusing as much on software sales in North America. We do believe that this part of the business is very exciting and has huge potential as we continue to gain account, small, medium and large and expand our governing position in this software technology arena. Note that we had a slight negative sales growth impact in the fourth quarter related to switches between agency and direct sales. You may recall that in the third quarter of 2017, we had rightfully focused a significant portion of our technology sales force as I noted as we prepared to launch Dentsply Sirona equipment products this past December. ","We saw that impact carry over into the fourth quarter of 2017 as we supported this launch. We expect our software sales to begin to show improve year-over-year growth in 2018 as we transition to the initial launch of Dentsply Sirona product line in the US.","On the international market, we delivered double digit international sales growth in local currencies of 11.4%, highlighted by heightened strong dental and animal health software revenue. Note that in December we announced the acquisition of eVetPractice, a leading provider of Cloud based practice management solutions for health clinics. As the veterinary practice management software market expand is the cloud based solution, with eVetPractice, we are well positioned to provide customers with the latest and value-added services and technology solution as part of our integrated portfolio technology platform which include [Abby Mark Impermade] in North America, as well as [Vision, RX Works and Robovic] internationally. eVetPractice compliment those offerings to customers who prefer to benefits of a cloud solution. We now have an excellent offering of cloud solution in the dental and in the animal health space. ","We remain and so we remain extremely optimistic about our practice solutions business. And see great opportunity to add strategic capability to our platform during 2018 to 2020 strategic planning period. This is a very exciting part of our business and we are really well positioned to help our customers operate more efficient practices thus provide better clinical care. ","Before I open the call for questions, I'd like to make a few comments related to our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan. First, we are pleased to recognize by The Ethisphere Institute as 2018 World's Most Ethical Companies marking the 7th consecutive year we received this recognition. The Ethisphere Institute is a global leader in defining and advancing standard of ethical business practices. It is an honor to be recognized among some of the world's most respected businesses for our commitment to ethical business practices and corporate social responsibility. Our corporate goal for the coming three years is to further enhance our platform of value-added solutions that address customers' needs with network of trusted advisors. It is the core reason that our customers rely on us. We help our customers operate more efficient and successful practices so our customers can focus on providing the best in clinical care. ","The three business priorities reinforced in the 2018 -2020 plan includes the fundamental of one: particularly expanding our core distribution business. Two: creating an enhanced customer loyalty through our value-added solution and three, advancing our investment in exclusive proprietary products. We will accomplish this through advancing our core distribution capabilities and value-added solutions, working closely with the set of manufacturers that are interested and focused on capitalizing on Henry Schein's brand equity with exclusive proprietary brands than a partnership with specialty products. ","Of course focus on digital commerce, increasing high margin products, including specialty products and technology solutions, expanding our global footprint and yes, investing in Team Schein, our number asset. So, I realize that was a lot that we had spoken about today. And we are open for questions. Operator, if there are any questions from participants in the call. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess starting off with the dental, Stan, could you give us a little bit more color on the strong equipment growth you are seeing in the US? I mean inventory on the balance sheet continues to build and maybe if you can provide a little color there. Then the follow up is in animal health. Just wondering how the Merritt that acquisition that you guys announced last year is coming along. How the integration is going? Thank you.","Stanley Bergman ","So let me start with the end. The Merritt acquisition is totally integrated. We delivered on our expectations perhaps even a little bit better. On the equipment, we believe we are well positioned to help practitioners take advantage of the new technology that is available to them to increase the efficiency of their practice and position them to provide better clinical care. This is not only in the US but it's abroad. Of course, we are delighted to have become a full line distributor of the Dentsply Sirona product offering but our expansion in equipment sales and related services is related -- not only to Dentsply Sirona but to a number of other manufactures that I mentioned in the call. We are very well positioned to continue to grow well in this part of the dental market. And dentists are investing in their practices wanting to add the latest technology which is also indicative of the optimism that dentists had in dentistry. And again, let me emphasize, this is in the US but Canada and abroad likewise dental laboratories are also investing in their labs and are heavily investing in digital technology. ","Steven Paladino","On part of your question, let me just first add that 18% sales growth included both strong growths in traditional equipment, traditional equipment was double digits and high tech equipment was also double digit a bit higher than the traditional. So it's really across the board strong sales growth in all aspects of dental equipment in North America. Related to our inventory, yes, we did have to bring in inventory in order to meet demand and expected demand for Dentsply Sirona products, it's typical for us to have showroom inventory as well as being able to fill the orders as quickly as the customers needs or want. But I will say that both on working capital we do have a goal of improving inventory turns. I'd like to see somewhere close to half a turn improvement over the next year or so. So we do think that there is opportunity to become more efficient on inventory management going forward also. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson of Baird.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys. So Steve or Stanley I guess either one. Just wondering the last couple of quarters you've been trending towards -- at least towards that 3% number on a dental consumable North American basis, if we exclude some of the noise, just wondering if you think that's a reasonable number to be thinking for 2018. I know you don't guide by line items but that's kind of where that number has been. So any reason we shouldn't think that number can repeat again this year. And then we've heard that flu maybe having a little impact on cancellation early this year. Just are you hearing any feedback from your customers about dental trends being impacted at all by the heavy flu season we've been seeing? ","Stanley Bergman ","So, Jeff, on the market, the market is relatively stable. Maybe it's growing a percent - potentially little bit more than that. There is a bit more optimism now than perhaps a year ago. So it's definitely leaning in the positive area. And we continue to gain market share, we hear this from our manufacturers, the data that is available showing us that we continue to gain market share. Whether we grow 2% or 3% or 4%, it's sort of in that range. And let me just emphasize that equipment is very strong. We expected to remain strong because dentists are investing in their practices. As it relates to flu, yes, I think the statistics are out there that flu is having impact on the population. I think it's the highest percentage of the population to be effected by the flu virus in many years. So I think it will impact visits to dentists in specific parts of the country. But I don't think that will have a significant impact on Henry Schein's ability to deliver results we are focused on and we anticipate. ","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay, great. Maybe as a follow up just on the FTC case. I am sure you can't say much or won't say much but I think you had 14 days to respond to the complaints included in that filing. And if you didn't then they were deemed to be admitted to. From your comments, Stanley, I am assuming you are going to respond to each of those complaints. But, Steve, I guess I am wondering also if there is anything embedded in guidance from a cost standpoint either from a compliant standpoint and an independent monitor standpoint or legal expense standpoint how should we be thinking about the expenses embedded in 2018 guidance from this issue? Thanks. ","Stanley Bergman ","So, Jeff, Steven will response to the financial aspect. But Henry Schein, I think is the very first time we ever commented on litigation. But we feel this case is so outrageous and this is the one fundamental point. We've done business with dental buying groups for many years. Henry Schein, in fact was the company that conceived the notion of dealing with special markets and groups of customers. We continue to do business with very large buying groups, mid-sized buying groups, and we are now accused of refusing to do business with these people who actually have been doing business with for 20 plus years. So we absolutely deny these allegations. We don't know what others have done or what potentially others have done but we have not done anything wrong in our view and this case is without merit from our point of view. As you know Henry Schein is the company where we have prided ourselves with ethical behavior, adherence to the laws, integrity, and honesty and how can we do something that -- how can we agree to do something that we are already doing. It just doesn't make sense. The FTC is accusing us of doing something that we are actually doing. So it's beside logic this whole thing and we vehemently, vehemently refute these allegations. And this is the first time I think in the 22 years as a public company, we've actually commented on litigation because this is so outrageous. ","Steven Paladino","Yes. So the only thing I would add on that is that the complaint if you take the time to read the complaint has some, what I would call, provocative comments. But don't be swayed and I am glad that you asked the question, Jeff, for the benefit of everyone, don't be swayed by provocative statements. Go back to the basics which Stanley just mentioned which is how could we be accused of conspiring not to sell to certain buying groups when we are selling and we have been selling and we've always sells to the same buying group. So, again be careful not to be swayed by again provocative statements in the complaint. As far as financial impact, again, there is no monetary damages or fines that the complaints are seeking. It's only injunctive relief; we do have an estimate built into our guidance for some legal cost and other cost in order to deal with the matter. Hopefully we have estimated that well although as you can probably guess it's hard to estimate that with perfection. But we do believe that we have it adequately covered in the guidance. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Glen Santangelo of Deutsche Bank.","Glen Santangelo","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Stan, I apologize in advance for hitting this FTC issue one more time. But I think it's such a big deal for investors. You seemed to make the case that you were selling to the certain classic customers all along and hence the complaint is merit less, but if you look at the complaint they actually say that the companies were conspiring to refuse to provide discount. So it kind of sound likes in the complaint that the company may have been treating this one sort of customer class a little bit differently from a discounting perspective. And I guess what investors are nervous about if that's true, will you have to adjust your business practices in way that kind of make you slightly less profitable on a go forward basis. So you may not be able to comment but I figure I would throw out there. ","Stanley Bergman ","So we deny these allegations. We have been a company that is worked with GPOs whether it's in the dental space, the medical and animal health space for a long time. I don't think, can't imagine any scenario where we have to now start adjusting our pricing policy because of the FTC complaint. We have been servicing this customers, we were the company that conceived the notion of special markets 22 years ago where we went out to service large group practices, we now have a mid market group that is focused on mid market practices. And have supported small practices involved in buying group for a long time. So this whole thing doesn't make sense from Henry Schein point of view. And I don't believe this would impact our margin is possible. I don't think, other factors could impact our margin and as Steven has noted on many occasions we are working to increase our efficiency to advance sales higher margin product et cetera. But I don't think this particular set of circumstances will impact our margins. ","Glen Santangelo","Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just one follow-up for Steven on the guidance. Steven, if you look at the raise, it looks like you raised about $0.18 at the mid point and you also absorbed the incremental $0.02 a cost in the employee comp expense. And so if you think about that as an equivalent of $0.20 raise, some are concerned that if you look at the tax differentials that that would have been a little bit bigger than $0.20 would have implied a little big than the $0.20 raise. A little bit surprising giving how strong the organic sales trends seemed to be and the momentum seems to be heading in the right directions. So any sort of comments as sort of reconciles those two points so we know how to think about that?","Steven Paladino","Sure. Well, first of all, our guidance increase was only related to the tax impact net of the $0.02 comp that we talked about. We did not change guidance for any other aspects of the business. And if you look at -- and you could the math yourself, but if you look at an estimate of somewhere between 3% and 4% lower tax rate for the company, and if you use something even to mid point of that range, I think you will quickly get to the guidance that we gave. Remember, this is a very complex tax law. We are still feeling our way around it. So the goal is to be a little bit conservative on our guidance on it because of many moving parts including what percentage of our income is within the US versus in other tax jurisdiction. And but again the guidance was only changed because of that. I'd also remind you that if you remember in Q1 of this year, we had 2017 we had an outsized tax benefit for long-term compensation that was because the stock prices is one of the variables that determines our investing date, what the actual tax deduction will be and because over the three year period that ended in Q1 of 2017, the stock price performance was very strong. We are not expecting that same benefit in 2018. So that's what built into our tax guidance also. But again if you just do the math as I outlined, I think you will come very close to what we did in guidance. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Hi, great, thanks for the questions. I just go back to the US dental equipment, 18% internal growth. I know, Stanley, you mentioned that it was a combination of legacy equipment that you had access to and then also obviously Sirona portfolio that's new. Is there any more perspective you can share there for us? I think it's important for investors to try to parse out just how much of that big ramp in growth was attributable to your access to the Sirona portfolio specifically? ","Stanley Bergman ","Yes. We are not giving guidance on the breakdown we never had between the manufactures that we --to generate sales from. So I think and Steven had some clarifying points here. We've never done that. So I think it's best to ask the manufacturers directly.","Steven Paladino ","Yes. No, I don't want to give specific supplier guidance. But we did say that traditional equipment was very strong also at double digits within that 18%. And I'll just comment that the Dentsply Sirona was not a significant impact our traditional equipment. It was more A-dec and other lines that we have. And Dentsply Sirona really impacts more for us, the high tech equipment at least in this most recent quarter. So, again, it was really broad based our equipment sales growth. So we are very pleased with that. ","Robert Jones","That's helpful. And I guess just go back to the FTC complaint. I know, Stanley, clearly we understand your view on the matter. But I was more curious just if you guys could talk to what the range of outcomes is possible from this? Is there anything you can share with us as far as what types of resolutions on what timeline we might expect? I don't think there is another official trial date until October, so just wondering what kind of guide post or types of outcome we should think about related to this.","Stanley Bergman ","Bob, if you pull the complaint because it is public information. You can see what the complaint is asking for relief, so there are details in that. And rather than me going by memory, I refer you to the complaint directly. But, again, it's all injunctive relief. There are no financial damages but take a look at the detail complaint because that's all we know at this point. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel. ","Jon Block","Thanks, guys. Good morning. Two questions. Let me ask first within -- hopefully I'll have time for follow up. So just to shift gears, international dental consumable results, I believe downed 2.6%. That was the first negative quarter that I have seen since 1Q, 2015, you guys navigated internationally very well during some of the macro weakness but anything to call out there or do you expect to bounce back in the coming quarters and then I just got a quick follow up. Thanks. ","Steven Paladino","Well, the weakness internationally, really was a not new event although maybe is more pronounced this quarter. We did talk about in certain European countries specifically Germany with some weakness in that market last quarter. That's continuing. I think we do believe that European market is still a very good market. We are very focused on improving our value add component. We are very advanced in the US and some other market. And we are not just quite advanced at this time in Germany and a couple of other markets. But there is a strong focus on that. So I think I can't say in the next quarter necessarily, but if you think out medium term, I think that you will see more improvement in our international dental revenues. ","Stanley Bergman ","Just and again without putting a new metric after this, you are going to have track every quarter, just simply this is too much to track for investors. But in Germany, there were five I think less business days this quarter because of the way the holidays fell. And there is a challenge in the consumable market in Italy. We don't think it's going to be the challenge for that long. And there were some weakness in France on consumables but we don't see any of these things as long term trend. ","Jon Block","Okay, great, thank you. And quick follow-up. Steven, you called it a potential I believe restructuring that you alluded to later in 2018. And frequent restructuring certainly are not common for Henry Schein. I think you last took one in 2016. So at a high level any details you can provide, what division would this be specific to? What do you guys tweaking? Because again I think restructurings prior work maybe every four or five years and now you can called out one possibly in 2018 after one in 2016. Thanks for your time guys.","Steven Paladino","Sure, Jon. It's hard -- we are just looking at what the opportunities are. And the reason why I mentioned it is because we do think there are further opportunities to improve profitability, to take some cost out of the system. But at this point, it's really part of the analysis. We haven't completed the analysis. So I don't have specifics. I can't tell you exactly where it might be or what the potential benefit would be. But I do raise it because I think that there is a reasonably good likelihood that when we finish the analysis; we'll have opportunities to improve profitability through restructuring activities. You are right it's not something that we do all time. But we think there is opportunity here and why not take advantage of it at this time. ","Stanley Bergman ","And also just more color we don't expect this to have any material impact -- certainly no material impact on the front end of the house in terms of sales force reductions or anything like that. But we've been investing in software and systems and we think we can increase our efficiency on those areas and also integrate some of our acquisitions that we made in the past into our core system. So it's that kind of work and we are -- we've been working on this for a while for past six months. And now we finally concluded working towards concluding what specific plans to implement. ","Steven Paladino","So I guess also the short follow up is we'll give a further update next quarter as we have those plans more fully developed. ","Operator","Your final question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning. Couple of housekeeping. Steven, was there any outsized flu impact to the medical revs in the fourth quarter? And then could you just confirm in terms of the 2018 guidance what it embeds for currency tailwind on EPS as well as your margin expansion expectations for the year? Thanks.","Steven Paladino ","Sure. Flu vaccine sales were little bit stronger in Q4 versus Q3 but it wasn't a material impact on our overall sales growth. We do expect to sell a similar number of doses somewhere in the 6 million -7 million dose range in 2018 that's embedded in our guidance. And foreign exchange, we are really not expecting any major movement in foreign exchange from current levels. Obviously, our guidance can absorb it on the downside or have upside, small movement because the range is wide enough to absorb that. But a bit of material change in foreign exchange rate we would call it out in 2018 should have happened. ","Carolynne Borders","Thank you. Now Stan will conclude with his remarks. ","Stanley Bergman ","Thank you, everyone for calling in. Thank you for the questions as I think you can tell from Steven and my tone, we remain most optimistic about the company. And we are very excited as we unfold our 2018, 2020 strategic plan. We feel very good with our high-touch value added proposition of serving customers with wide array of value-added services and delivered through our field consultants and supported by telesales and what we believe to be world class electronic ordering and other ways of doing business with Henry Schein. And are very, very enthusiastic about the future. So thanks for your interest. Again, if you have questions you can call Steve at 5915; it is the last four digits for Henry Schein number and Carolynne --","Carolynne Borders","631-3908-105","Stanley Bergman ","So thank you very much and we will be back in I believe 60 days right or 90 days. Just under 90 days. Thank you. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"10994":["Henry Schein, Inc.

With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during the call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimate. The contents of this conference call contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 6, 2017. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.","I ask that during the Q&A portion, you limit yourself to a single question and a follow up before returning to the queue, allowing as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour that we have allotted for the call.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Carolynne, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start today's call by making a few high-level comments.","Our sales results for the third quarter was solid overall and reflect continued success with our comprehensive offering of products and value-added services that drive internal growth bolstered by strategic acquisitions. This combination of internal growth and complementary acquisitions is at the heart of our business model.","Third quarter sales growth was negatively impacted by the recent hurricanes in the U.S., as well as a difficult comparable in dental equipment sales. We have a track record \u2013 a solid track record, I might add, of gaining market share with the combination of internal sales growth and acquisition growth. Our normalized internal local currency growth has been in the range of 4% to 6% for the past 14 quarters, built on years of great success in internal local currency growth. This has been supplemented by approximately 1% to 5% of acquisition growth over the same period.","So, the track record on sales is a good one, and we remain confident that we will continue to build on this track record. Steven will review our 2017 and 2018 guidance in a bit more detail later.","During 2018 and beyond, we expect to continue to make progress with our focus on increasing sales of higher-margin products across all of our businesses, as well as improving operating efficiencies to achieve long-term EPS growth.","We are confident and indeed excited about our long-term prospects, and believe we are very well positioned in the markets we serve to continue to increase market share through internal growth, supplemented by strategic acquisition, whilst increasing operating margin.","Let me now ask Steven to review our financial results, and then I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. Steven?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, let me first point out that all of our per share amounts that I will be discussing today reflect the 2-for-1 stock split that we recently completed. In addition, last year's Q3 2016 results include restructuring cost of $5.4 million pre-tax or $0.02 per diluted share.","As Stanley mentioned, our 2017 third quarter results were negatively impacted by the recent hurricanes in the U.S., among other factors that I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. While it is difficult to quantify the precise impact, we estimate that the hurricanes negatively impacted our worldwide sales growth by approximately 30 basis points and negatively impacted our EPS by approximately $0.005.","So, I'll also be discussing our results on an as-reported GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis, and that non-GAAP basis excludes the prior-year restructuring cost. On year-to-date non-GAAP measure, the current year-to-date also excludes litigation settlement expense.","We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business. It enables the comparison of financial results between periods, where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures. You could see in Exhibit C of this morning's earnings release a reconciliation as well as a reconciliation that's provided on our Investor Relations section of our website.","So, turning to our results for the quarter. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, were $3.2 billion, reflecting a 10.3% increase compared with the third quarter of 2016. This consisted of 8.8% growth in local currencies and a 1.5% increase related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally-generated sales increased 4.8% and acquisition growth contributed an additional 4.0% growth. Again, we estimate that the hurricanes negatively impacted our worldwide sales growth by approximately 30 basis points. You could also see the details about sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued earlier this morning.","If you look at the operating margin for the third quarter of 2017; it was 6.8% and contracted by 25 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2016. Some additional details on our operating margin in Q3. The first relates to the inclusion of restructuring costs in last year's third quarter. These restructuring costs in the prior year favorably impacted operating margin comparisons by 19 basis points. Secondly, sales of influenza vaccines in the third quarter of 2017 negatively impacted our operating margin comparison by about 14 basis points.","And the third item relates to acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, which combined to negatively impact our operating margin comparison by 7 basis points. Excluding the net impact of these items, our operating margin contracted by approximately 23 basis points year-over-year. I think it's important to also note that on a year-to-date basis, excluding the impact of these same factors, as well as the litigation settlement expense in last quarter, our operating margin expanded by 6 basis points.","So, I'd like to discuss a little bit our gross margins, which were negatively influenced by three primary factors. The first was product mix. Given that the lower gross margin in Medical and Animal Health businesses have been growing at a faster rate than the higher margin Dental sales, our overall gross profit has been impacted by that product mix. There was also a product mix that negatively impacted within each of Medical and our Animal Health businesses.","Secondly, our U.S. dental special markets business have lower margins, where we took the opportunity to extend a number of multi-year contracts with key dental support organizations or DSOs. And third, we saw lower gross margins in our European dental business, in particular in Germany. These factors were partially offset by lower expenses, as a percentage of sales as we continue to realize operating efficiencies from previous restructuring efforts, and we continue to leverage our infrastructure and control expenses.","If we look at our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2017, it was 29.0%. This compares to 28.9% GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter of last year 2016 or 28.7% on a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2016. That non-GAAP basis last year also excludes the income tax benefit on restructuring cost.","We expect the 2017 full-year effective tax rate to be in the 28% range on a GAAP basis and 27% range when excluding the estimated loss on our divestiture of E4D, which we estimate to be about $17 million to $18 million. And both Stanley and I will discuss that in greater detail, but that is a Q4 event since the transaction closed in early Q4.","For 2018, we expect the effective tax rate to be a little bit higher to be in the range of 28% and 29%. And this increase over 2017 is primarily because of the ASU 2016-09 accounting literature, which relates to tax benefits on stock-based compensation. This standard primarily impacts us in Q1 each year, as this is when the majority of our stock-based awards vest at Henry Schein.","We expect a higher tax rate based on the estimated share price and the number of shares that are expected to vest in 2018. This higher tax rate will, of course, negatively impact our 2018 diluted EPS growth assumptions since we expect the tax benefit from stock-based compensation to be less in 2018 than it was in 2017.","Moving on to net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter of 2017, it was $138.0 million or $0.87 per diluted share. This compares with the GAAP results for the third quarter of 2016 and represents growth of 3.2% and 6.1%, respectively. Compared with the non-GAAP results for third quarter of 2016, this represents growth of 0.2% and 3.6%, respectively. I'll also note that foreign exchange had a positive impact on our diluted EPS for the quarter of almost $0.01.","Let me provide some additional detail on our sales results for the quarter. Our Dental sales for the third quarter of 2017 increased 11.1% to $1.5 billion. Internally generated sales in local currencies were up 1.6%, acquisitions contributed 7.5%, and there was a 2.0% increase to foreign exchange.","Our North American internal sales growth in local currencies was 0.8% and included 1.3% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. The growth in consumable products was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points, as a result of the recent hurricanes, and an additional approximately 90 basis points due to a loss of a previously disclosed DSO contract. Our internal sales growth in local currencies would have been 2.7% without these two factors.","We also expect stable market growth for the dental consumable merchandise business going forward. Our North American dental equipment sales and service revenue declined by 0.7% for the quarter. This is primarily related to a difficult prior-year comparison in which internal sales growth was 13.3% in local currency. That growth was in part due to a very successful sales promotion in the prior year.","Also, our dental equipment sales growth was negatively impacted by approximately 60 basis points from the hurricanes and by approximately an additional 110 basis points from the loss of that same previously disclosed DSO contract. However, it's important also to note that at the end of the quarter, our equipment backlog continued to remain healthy.","So early in the fourth quarter, we divested our 21.4% equity ownership of E4D Technologies, the manufacturer of the Planmeca CAD\/CAM system. We will continue to distribute the Planmeca line of CAD\/CAM products in the U.S. and Canada on a non-exclusive basis, and in Australia and New Zealand on an exclusive basis.","Planmeca manufactures a highly respected brand of advanced digital dental solutions, and we are pleased to continue to represent their products to Henry Schein customers. The divestiture is expected to generate a one-time non-cash charge of between $17 million and $18 million or $0.10 to $0.11 per diluted share in Q4 2017.","Turning to international, our international dental internal growth in local currencies was 3.2% and included 3.4% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 2.6% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. Our Animal Health sales were $882.6 million for the third quarter, which was an increase of 11.7%. Here, we see internal generated sales growth in local currencies was up 8.0%, acquisitions contributed an additional 1.9% and there was a 1.8% increase due to foreign exchange.","The 8.0% internal growth in local currencies included 9.0% growth in North America and 6.9% growth internationally. About 30 basis points of sales growth in North America was from certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales, resulting in a normalized growth of about 8.7%.","Also, the sales growth in North America also included a negative impact from the hurricanes of about 50 basis points. We believe the strong sales growth reflects the healthy end market and our commitment to offering a wide range of products and value-added solutions.","Turning to Medical sales, they were $690.8 million for the third quarter, an increase of 8.0%. Internally generated sales in local currencies were up 7.8%, acquisitions contributed an additional 0.1% and an increase in foreign exchange was the remaining 0.1%.","Of that 7.8% internal growth in local currencies, included 7.9% in North America; and that 7.9% also includes a negative impact of hurricanes of about 25 basis points. And the international internal growth in local currencies was 4.5%. We are very pleased with our Medical growth, which was primarily driven by strong organic growth of existing larger customers.","Our Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $109 million in the quarter, an increase of 4.1%. Internally generated sales in local currencies were up 3.0%, acquisitions an additional 0.7% and 0.4% due to foreign exchange. The 3% internal growth in local currencies included 2% growth in North America and 8.7% growth internationally.","I think it's important to note that within North America, that 2% growth reflects lower dental software sales and financial services revenue versus the prior year's quarter. The financial services revenue was primarily related to lower dental equipment sales. Obviously as we have lower sales, we finance less equipment because of the lower sales. We don't believe that there was any significant impact on the technology business related to the hurricanes.","In the international market, we had strong growth of 8.7%, highlighted by strong veterinary software revenue growth. Related to stock repurchase, we continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the third quarter. More specifically during Q3, we spent about $125 million to repurchase approximately 1.4 million shares. The impact of this repurchase on our third quarter diluted EPS was not material.","On September 18, 2017, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $400 million of shares of our common stock. So, at the close of the third quarter, Henry Schein had approximately $425 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock.","Our capital allocation strategy is focusing on deploying a large portion of our annual free cash flow to both share repurchases and M&A activities. We believe the strategy is a key component of our commitment to increasing shareholder value.","If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, operating cash flow was $131.4 million compared to $178.6 million in the third quarter of last year, and we believe we'll continue to have strong operating cash flow for the year. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding were virtually unchanged over the last year and inventory turns increased slightly by 0.1 turn on the current year.","So let me just conclude my remarks by discussing our 2017 and 2018 financial guidance. For 2017, we now expect GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein and that includes the litigation settlement expenses to be $3.46 to $3.48, and that guidance reflects growth of 12% compared to the 2006 GAAP guidance \u2013 or GAAP actual results of $3.10.","We are adjusting our 2017 non-GAAP guidance range and now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS, which excludes the litigation settlement expenses, as well as the Q4 loss associated with the E4D divestiture to be in the range of $3.59 to $3.61. This guidance reflects growth of 8% to 9% compared with 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.31, and that $3.31 in the prior year also excludes the restructuring cost.","So, looking at Q4, we expect the U.S. dental market conditions to continue to be stable. I'll also note that we expect one-time integration cost of approximately $1.3 million related to the integration of Merritt Veterinary Supplies, as we consolidate the Merritt distribution centers into the existing Henry Schein facilities and combine our systems. We also expect continued lower gross margins in both Europe and the new DSO contracts, although we expect these lower gross margins will be partially mitigated by lower operating expenses.","For fiscal 2017, it includes one less week than 2016. Note also that our guidance for 2017 EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for current continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisition, but does not include the impact of potential future unannounced acquisitions, if any. Guidance also assumes that the foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels.","Turning to next year, we are introducing guidance for 2018. At this time, please note that our 2018 guidance is based on current revenue recognition standards. However, we do not believe that the impact of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 will be material to our earnings results. We are continuing to review that situation. And should that be different, we'll obviously update shareholders.","For 2018, we expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $3.85 to $3.96. That reflects growth of 11% to 14% compared with the mid-point of our 2017 GAAP guidance, and growth of 7% to 10% compared with the mid-point of our 2017 non-GAAP guidance range.","As a reminder, we expect to have less stock-based compensation tax benefit in 2018 than we did in 2017. Therefore, we are guiding towards a effective tax rate of 1 percentage points to 2 percentage points higher than the 2017 rate. We would also expect that the lower gross margins that we've experienced in Europe, as well as in the U.S. related to the new DSO contracts will continue until it annualizes later \u2013 or late in 2018. Again, this guidance assumes that our end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions.","The 2018 guidance attributable \u2013 EPS guidance attributable to Henry Schein is for continuing operations again, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions and does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions if any. And again, we assume that foreign exchange rates are consistent with current levels.","So with that summary, let me now turn the call back to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Steven. We believe Henry Schein serves the largest worldwide base of dental, animal health and medical office space practitioners, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive EPS growth through increased sales and margins complemented by operating efficiencies, driven through our unique infrastructure and strong value-added services offering.","We have believed in the statement now for the 22 years that we've been a public company, and remain confident as ever that we as a company are well positioned to continue sales growth through internal local currency growth, coupled with synergistic acquisition growth.","Excluding the impact of the hurricanes and the loss of the previously disclosed DSO contract, our internal growth in local currencies in the third quarter was 5.4%. We believe that that is at least 2 times, if not more, the market growth.","We have a solid track record of gaining market share with normalized internal local currency growth, which has been in the range of 4% to 6% for the past 14 quarters. I started the call this way, and I'd like to stress this. And of course, even before that 14 \u2013 for the last 14 quarters, the track record has been outstanding.","We remain confident that we can supplement our internal local currency growth with synergistic acquisitions. We have a policy of not talking about acquisitions specifically until the acquisition is closed. And so we do not want to count our chickens before they hatch, but we do have a decent pipeline of acquisitions, of M&A investments, and putting money to work \u2013 capital to work, so that we could increase our synergies over time and driving operating income, and so EPS growth.","We have, as a priority, a plan to increase sales of higher-margin products, and so continue to drive gross margin improvements. We believe we can enhance our offering with additional technology and other solutions, including specialty products, product exclusives, and the Henry Schein brand and other controlled solutions to name a few areas of focus.","At Henry Schein, we have a longstanding ongoing commitment to efficiency in all that we do. Of course, at our world class distribution centers, in the field through our field sales consultants and regional offices, and of course the corporate head office, and through streamlining acquired businesses.","We are constantly looking for ways to be more efficient, all the while maintaining our commitment to best-in-class customer service and order accuracy that Henry Schein is known for throughout the world. We are also committed to the success of our manufacturing partners, no less today than ever before, and of course, to the growth and profitability of our dental, animal health, and physician customer practices, which is at the heart of our strategy.","With that background, let me now begin my review of our full business units with dental. The North American dental consumable merchandise internal growth in local currency was 2.7%, when excluding the impact of the hurricanes and the loss of previously disclosed DSO \u2013 and the previously disclosed DSO contract. Again, we believe we continue to gain market share in this market.","Based on our current view, we continue to expect stable market growth for dental consumable merchandise across North America. We believe the domestic dental market should realize unit growth improvement over time, driven by demographics of the aging population, as well as by emphasis that is gaining momentum, showing the link between good oral care and overall health.","North American dental equipment internal growth in local currencies faced a tough prior year comparison as Steven mentioned. However, we see continued capital equipment investments by North American practices, which is indeed encouraging as we consider the health and stability of the broader end market.","One of the areas we are most excited about in the dental professions is the dental professions' continued adoption of digital technologies. We are fully committed to offering a broad set of digital solutions on behalf of all of our manufacturing partners aimed at realizing greater practice efficiencies and enhanced patient satisfaction.","In addition, we are pleased with the initial reception from dental customers in North America, following the addition of the full line of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment. We believe that practices leveraging dental technologies, not only increase the efficiency of the diagnosis and the effectiveness of the diagnosis, treatment and productivity with existing patients, but advanced technologies will also drive greater patient flow through the practitioners' offices, due to the enhanced services they offer.","This is the most exciting dental strategy, the advance \u2013 at the moment in Henry Schein, the advancing of digital technology in our customers' offices. Henry Schein now has access to a wide and comprehensive offering of digital prosthetic equipment solutions, and, therefore, as Steven mentioned, we divested our equity interest in E4D Technologies a few weeks ago. This is a logical step in the evolution of our goal to offer a broad selection of dental equipment solutions to our customers through an open architecture market approach.","The Planmeca restorative system, including the Emerald digital intraoral scanner, which has recently been released, will continue to be an important offering enabling dental practitioners to deliver high-quality, one-visit dental restoration. We are looking forward to continuing to represent the Planmeca CAD\/CAM brand as part of our efforts to advance our leadership position in the dental digital marketplace.","We believe CAD\/CAM represents an attractive long-term growth opportunity. We will continue to represent the complete lines of equipment from other key suppliers as well, including 3M, 3Shape, A-dec, Danaher, Ivoclar, Midmark, Planmeca, and many others.","Also, we continue to be well-positioned in the global dental lab market providing solutions for digital restorations that are outsourced to laboratory facilities. We also now had access to a broad line of digital prosthetic materials and as a result recently divested our ownership position in a company that produces materials used for manufacturing dental restorations and distributes lab products in China.","Our investment provided us with access to high-quality zirconia products, a clinically advanced prosthetic material used in digital dentistry. Today, we are well-positioned globally with our supply of zirconia and other CAD\/CAM-related materials, and, therefore, elected to divest of this position. There was a slight gain on this divestiture in the third quarter. So, I have to say that we are very pleased today with our comprehensive offering of all digital equipment and related materials from imaging to digital prosthetics in the office, the operatory and also in the dental laboratory.","It's been a long journey to get to this point, but we are finally here, and I'm very, very pleased with our offering and our commitment to open architecture that is so well connected with our digital practice management platform and the related clinical workstation that we offer to our customers both in small, medium-sized, large practices institutions like dental schools and elsewhere, including the U.S. military.","On the international front, dental consumable merchandise and dental equipment internal sales in local currencies both grew in the low single-digits. In particular, we are pleased about dental specialties internal local currency sales performance, which increased by 10% in the third quarter.","Our global implant orthodontic, endodontic and other dental surgical solution continues to be well-received in the marketplace. Relative to our plan to expand our dental specialty product sales, our endodontic specialty subsidiary recently made an investment in EdgeEndo, as an additional source of endodontic products for our dental practitioners and for the endo platform that we have.","EdgeEndo in 2016 had sales of approximately $17 million. We are pleased that the EdgeEndo product offering will now be available to our customers in our dental specialty arena. And they will, in turn, supply additional innovative endodontic products to complement our portfolio of solutions in the endodontic area.","Let me now touch on the Animal Health business. Our sales performance in the Animal Health business in the third quarter reflects strong execution across our global business. These markets continue to remain healthy with growth in North America, driven by our focus on the companion animal segment. We believe this growth is due to the breadth of our value-added solutions offering, including an enhanced product portfolio featuring software, diagnostic equipment, and surgical instruments.","During the quarter, we announced and closed on our acquisition of Merritt Veterinary Supplies, which is one of the nation's largest independent regional veterinary suppliers with sales in 2016 of approximately $115 million. Merritt serves approximately 4,500 veterinary clinics and will become part of the Henry Schein Animal Health group. We believe Merritt will meaningfully add to the scale of our U.S. animal health business, while reinforcing our existing presence across the Eastern U.S.","It also will benefit our diagnostic equipment\/surgical instrument businesses, including scil, KRUUSE, and veterinary instrumentation. We expect Merritt to be accretive to earnings per share at the beginning of 2018.","Now, let me address the activities in our Medical group. Solid internal sales growth in local currencies of 7.8% was driven by contributions from the large group practice segment of the market we have focused on for some time. This success reflects our commitment to solutions that help customers provide quality care and increase value in the delivery of health care services.","In keeping with our desire to expand our offering of specialized solutions that help physicians provide high-quality care, we announced an agreement with Cerebral Assessment Systems to distribute Cognivue. This is the first computerized cognitive assessment screening device cleared by the FDA to detect early signs of dementia.","We also entered into an exclusive agreement with Terason to distribute its uSmart 3200T portable ultrasound device. This product enables emergency responders to perform exams in medical transport patient vehicles and in aircrafts, and alert emergency room staff of relevant patient vitals while the patient is in transit. Our customers rely on us to offer technology-advanced devices such as this to help triage traumatic situations that require quick decision-making and treatment.","So, now the final group, the Technology and Value-Added Services group. As Steve noted, our results in North America reflect lower dental software sales. During the quarter, we refocused a significant portion of our technology sales force as we prepared to launch the Dentsply Sirona dental equipment product line this past September. With this initial ramp up, we expect our software sales in the fourth quarter to improve sequentially. Then we also point out that now with some of the larger accounts that we are providing services to on the software side, sales can be somewhat lumpy.","Indeed, a prime example of our value-added solutions portfolio is our software expertise. Our solutions help customers cost-efficiently manage their practice, while identifying new ways to attract and retain clients. This could be through clinical workflow integration between patient records, equipment, laboratory, connectivity, inventory management tools or marketing campaign. It is our consultative approach paired with our commitment to building technological solutions around the practice of specific needs that makes us such a valued partner to our customers.","Our highlight in this business has been market reception of our cloud-based practice management solution known as Dentrix Ascend. With this versatile software platform, solo- and now multiple-site practices can manage their practices with advanced next-generation practice management capabilities, store practice data in the cloud, and access information about that practice at that time. This is especially important for dentists who practice in multiple sites that require access to patient information from any location, so that they can create reports, track patient's care and centralize business operations.","With continued pressure on dental practices to remain efficient and productive, Dentrix Ascend is an excellent tool for streamlining practice processes for a wide spectrum of dental practices, but let me stress, particularly for the growing and larger dental practice \u2013 group practices, who are now seeking the efficient software in the cloud. Of course, a highlight of our business has been our partnership with Cerner, Leidos, and Accenture in servicing the health care management systems, modernizing the Department of Defense digital platform in dentistry.","The roll out of the Electronic Medical Record system is making good progress with three military sites live and functioning and a fourth in process. According to the Defense Department, this project will support the availability of Electronic Health Records to more than 9.4 million Department of Defense beneficiaries and appropriately 205,000 Military Health System personnel globally. We are most pleased to be part of this very important project.","So, a couple of closing comments before we take questions. And let me just reflect for a moment on a series of natural disasters across the U.S. over the past couple of months that have tested our nation. We are committed to providing relief organizations with health care supplies that need to support public health, so communities can get back on their feet and begin to work. We're also committed to working with our customers to get them back on their feet, whether this means activating helplines or joining the appropriate symposium on practice recovery as we have already done in Houston.","In line with Henry Schein and its supplier partners have donated more than $600,000 of cash and products to relief organizations and associations working in the hurricane-affected areas in the Southern part of the U.S. and into the Caribbean. We are working directly with organizations can make a difference on the ground. Of course, our hearts go out to those who were tragically killed yesterday in Texas.","On a more positive note, Henry Schein recently celebrated important milestones with the 25th anniversary of our Indianapolis distribution center, and the 15th anniversary of the Jacksonville facility, two of our five core distribution centers in the U.S. These are extremely productive distribution centers customized to the needs of the office-based practitioner. We thank the Team Schein Members in all of our distribution centers, and all of our distribution centers across the company in the U.S. and globally for the Henry Schein success on the distribution side.","So, that concludes my \u2013 Steve and my prepared remarks, and we are now pleased to answer questions from participants. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from the line of Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Steve, wanted to go back to your comments on gross margin. Could you quantify or give us a little bit more detail on the three factors that you laid out: the product mix; Dental specialty in European; Dental in Germany, and how much of an impact do you think that will have in 2018?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. Well, let me \u2013 we're not going to be very specific on that, but I would say that probably the largest impact was the European Dental business, which probably had the biggest impact in gross margins. I think it's important to note that we see that as something that as we continue to build out our value-added services in Europe that are not as advanced as we do have in the U.S. So, for example, in Germany, we don't have software solutions among other value-added services. So, we do think there's opportunity to improve those margins over time, and of course, we're looking at operating expense efficiencies also.","So, that was probably the largest. The second largest was probably product mix, where product mix worked against us, where the fastest-growing businesses were the slowest margin. And then, even within Medical and Animal Health, we had some mix issues. Specifically in Medical, we have lower gross margins on flu vaccine versus a year ago. And the last was special markets or dental support organizations. But we mentioned that even though we're smaller in the current quarter, it will be a little bit larger in Q4 and into 2018 until those contracts annualize. We're also working at being more efficient to improve the profitability of those contracts over time, but that's still something we're working on.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","And then, Steve, on the guidance for 2018, how much of an impact does the divestment of E4D \u2013 of your investment in E4D have on the EPS guidance?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. Really very little, because we picked up in the affiliate income our share of the gain or loss, but we'll continue to sell the E4D products and we would expect that sales would be still good. And remember, we only have a small interest of about 20% in E4D, so really not significant impact on the EPS.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. I appreciate the comments on the headwinds and tailwinds driving your 2018 guidance, but I wanted to clarify a few items. So, you said that you expect dental consumables to improve over time. Was that counted in 2018 guidance? Are you talking about longer term? Then, on DSO contracts, does your guidance assume any improvement in margins over the course of the contract? Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yes. So, I'll comment on improving Dental markets. It was really a longer-term comment. We really have not factored that in at this time in 2018. So, we'll wait and see how that turns out, and if we see an improvement, then of course there'll be some upside.","With respect to DSO contracts, we have initiatives where we think we can improve the profit \u2013 by the way, they're still profitable, so it's not like they're not profitable, but we do want to improve the profitability of DSO contracts. We're being a bit conservative there, because that's still work in process, so there's still some opportunity there in 2018 should we do better than what's in that guidance.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks for the questions. Just looking at the North American dental consumables in the quarter, it sounds like adjusting for the hurricane and the DSO loss, growth would have been closer to around 2.7%, somewhere in that neighborhood. I'm wondering, how would you guys characterize the health of the North American end market that you saw in the quarter? And then, if you could, I think last quarter you provided some helpful insight into the breakdown between price and volume within the growth you saw in North America dental consumables, that'd be helpful.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's the key question and I think the question that so many investors would like answer. It's very hard to give you a precise answer. Having said that, just attended the meeting of the American College of Prosthodontists, and the impression I get is that visits are stable; there are parts of the country a little bit ahead; we've seen a little bit increased number of procedures, but generally, I would say it's flat.","Furthermore, I would say that inflation is very, very little. It is a little bit, but there's also a movement more towards generics, towards corporate brands, and I would say even in some areas, a movement towards lower-cost brands. So, overall, that would be \u2013 if that was the only change, all other things being equal, it would improve our margin. But generally, I would say the market is stable and in terms of units, and \u2013 there is a little bit of net price inflation, but not much because the price increase of the branded manufacturers are being mitigated by the use of corporate brand generics and lower-cost brands. So, I would say that the market is relatively stable.","Longer term \u2013 and we are not contemplating this in our budgeting and in fact in our strategic plan for the next three years, because we'd rather be conservative \u2013 we're expecting the market in the U.S., in North America in terms of units to be stable with very slight increase in prices as some of the bigger customers move their volume towards more generic-type products, which is not bad from our margin point of view, but at least I think we need to be a little bit more conservative.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And I guess just, Steve, the company targets about 20 basis points of organic operating margin expansion each year. It looks like this year you're trending a little bit below that target. I guess, what's the impact of this year, and then how should we think about your ability to expand margins next year? What's reflected in the 2018 guidance closer to that 20 bps target?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. So, for the current year, we will be below that 20 basis points target, and as I said for nine months we were, on a normalized basis, about 6 basis points. Typically, Q4 is a strong margin for us, because of strong sales of technology as well as equipment. So, there should be hopefully some upside there. I think \u2013 we still think that operating margin expansion is very doable for us. It may not be exactly 20 basis points, maybe a little bit below that for 2018, but we still feel like there's a lot of opportunity to be more efficient, leverage the infrastructure, et cetera, to achieve that, and it's important to our financial model to be able to achieve that. So, we're still calling for overall operating margin expansion.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, guys. So yeah, maybe one more follow-up question on guidance for next year, and then I do have a DSO question as well. But, Steve, on your tax rate guidance for next year, by my math, that's about $0.10 or so, about 2.5 points to EPS. Just want to confirm that that math year-over-year is at least ballpark accurate. And then, to the point you just made, it would seem to imply then that your guidance for next year on the operating margin line is flat to maybe up 10 basis points or so. Is that about ballpark accurate as well? Thanks.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. It depends on \u2013 I think your math is correct. It depends on where in that 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points we end up because as you could imagine, there are a lot of moving factors in an effective tax rate. And we still are trying to estimate for this stock-based compensation. We still have to estimate the number of shares that we'll vest next year, as well as what the stock price will be on that vesting date. So, there's a little bit of things beyond our control in order to be very precise on that. But yes, it is a significant headwind for us. With respect to overall margins \u2013 and I said on the last question that I think it will be a little bit lower than the 20 basis points. So that's in line with what you're saying. But we still expect to get overall margin expansion in 2018.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. And then the follow-up on that and it's kind of tied to DSOs. I think we've all heard of one or two of the big renegotiations that have happened here recently. But what percentage of your DSO contracts are now locked in for maybe a multi-year basis or what are the odds that we get into 2018, and there's another kind of big round of renegotiations that we have to think about impacting as we go then into 2019? Just any comfort or any kind of color you can give us on where you are with your DSOs and how we should think about the next few years on a contractual basis.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question, Jeff. So, we believe that at this point, all of our major DSOs have multi-year agreements. Yes, there are some smaller ones that are not multi-year at this point. But I think the risk is all behind us. I think the fact that all of the major ones now are tied up in long-term agreements, means that the risk, while \u2013 it's not that there's no risk going forward. It's really much smaller than before this.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Jeff, let me just add that I think it's becoming clearly understood amongst the DSO community, as well as the mid-market community that Henry Schein brings unique value not only on the supply chain side, but on the consulting side and increasingly on the software side. So, every now and again, every few years, we do have a loss of an account, so pick up multiple accounts in that period. So, I think this market is quite stable and we're enjoying very good relationships with our large accounts. I have to say I've spent time with a few of them recently and the feeling that Henry Schein provides, the value that they are seeking as they're growing their businesses is quite high. So, I think we're in pretty good shape.","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","Chantelle, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for the time here. Maybe first one for me is actually on Europe. I really appreciate the narrative that you just gave there on the DSO dynamics. It would be really helpful on the gross margin front if you could just expand a little bit on some of the earlier commentary on Europe and margins and help us understand how things are evolving there.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well, so Europe, as people probably know, is still a market where there is still many, many smaller distributors out there. And, again, I think for us we feel like there's a big opportunity still in Europe, especially on the margin, even though the margin is contracting right now.","But again, we need to continue to advance all of our value-added solutions in order to bring more value to our customers, so they're not focused on the price of that last product even though we intend to be very competitive. But we do more than just get products sufficiently to customers at a very good price. We want to show all the value-add that we need to get compensated for also.","So, it's still a very small market. Most of the players are really just competing on price. They don't have the value-add. They don't have anything other than price and a little bit of relationship to compete on. So, over time, I think we'll have nice opportunities improving that.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then a quick follow-up for me is actually on U.S. dental equipment. I wonder if you could just talk about, given some of the changes that you've made both with regard to E4D and with regard to Dentsply Sirona, how you think about the trajectory of the U.S. dental equipment business within 2018. Thanks so much.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","We're quite optimistic, feel pretty good about the equipment market in the U.S., actually globally at the moment. I think there is a good movement towards dentists investing in their practices. In the traditional equipment area, I think, we're doing well with A-dec. I think Danaher, Midmark, other manufacturers, including Planmeca, I think, they've invested in their offerings, and these are well received by the customers on the traditional side, chairs, units, lights.","On imaging, I think there is still a lot of momentum to adding the digital imaging into the practice, still some practices that don't have it and there are practices upgrading. And CAD\/CAM is the area of great excitement. The scan-only, we continue to do well there. We have quite a large offering. These systems are, by and large, either integrated into Dentrix, Easy Dental, Ascend, college system, a dental school system, where they're about to be integrated. And I think there's huge opportunity there.","And in the chairside units, I think full chairside, CAD\/CAM, lots of excitement there. I think the Henry Schein salespeople add excitement to the marketplace, encouraging dentists to look at the full system, the addition of the Sirona line to us, the expansion of the offering by Planmeca, all of this adds excitement to the CAD\/CAM chairside arena. And there's a lot of activity going on in the laboratory, as the laboratory moves from manual to digitalized dentistry. So, we remain quite optimistic about equipment.","I believe Steven mentioned our pipeline is quite good going into the fourth quarter. I think last year, we had about 13% growth in the third quarter. So, if you average that out with now \u2013 with this past quarter, 6%, 7-or-so-percent growth is quite good. It's certainly more than the market is growing. We are excited about this area both from the interest of a dentist in equipment and equipment technology, and our ability to continue to grow market share tying that into our digital practice solutions platform as well.","Operator","And your final question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, appreciate fitting me in. I'll ask maybe just one question with two parts. Steven, I may have missed this, but did you give any concrete numbers to sort of traditional consumable growth versus at a specialty?","And then the second part would be Stanley, within traditional consumables, do you see an increased risk of, call it, a subset of these traditional consumables going to a pure online provider, possibly at slightly lower cost? Thanks, guys.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. So, on the first piece of your question, I didn't give specifics, but the specialty sales growth did grow faster. I think it was in the mid-single-digit range, I don't have the exact number in front of me, but somewhere in the mid-single digit range. So yes, it continue to grow faster than the core consumable number.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","So, thank you, Steven. You're asking I think a very important question. On the digital standalone potential consumer distributors, there has always been and a price-driven components in dentistry. This has been the case for almost 40 years. Henry Schein built our initial business on coming out with a catalog, listing prices of all products, having those prices in stock and having great fulfillment. We were able to get to about 8% market share and could not go beyond that because dentist need much more than the consumable products at a discounted price if you will.","So, two points. One is that there are several companies out there that started out as mail order, and moved to telesales, and now are digital platforms. We have interests in those companies throughout the world, including one in the U.S., the biggest. And these businesses grow, but didn't grow much differently to the traditional full service dealers in terms of consumable products. The key here is for us to continue to offer the value added services, so that our value mainly that of our field sales consulting force.","Today, about 4,500 people around the world remains relevant and that the customers are prepared to pay and they pay some amount for those consultants to visit them, provide them the consulting advice on how to run the practice, on clinical efficiency, on quality of care, on simple business questions like where can I find somebody to help me run my office when I lost a general manager or lost somebody at the desk. I need to understand somebody who could help me use Dentrix. I need to find somebody who can help me do my marketing. All those kinds of things is a huge value in that.","So, we believe that the value-added service part of the offering continues to grow in importance and we're investing heavily in that area. So, the digital platform is an ordering platform, sometimes offered by standalone companies that only offer consumable products and is a part of the market that goes there.","And if it becomes really a price issue, well, Henry Schein has the largest variety of private brand, controlled brand products in the industry. We have practically everything a practitioner may need at very good prices. And if it becomes a price situation, we can win on that only \u2013 if that's the only issue.","So, there are lot of challenges that we have to face in our business like every other business. But to me this is not on the top of the list; this is an area we have to focus on. We have to focus on our digital software platform. We're investing in that, part of the expenses \u2013 additional expenses in 2016, 2017 and certainly 2018, 2019, and 2020 will be in the area of software to make our ordering platform even more efficient, more user-friendly, tying it into automatic order replenishment, video capability for particular product offerings, study clubs, all that kind of stuff. I don't think that that is something that our competitors in the supply chain only will be able to compete with.","Having said that, I think it will remain a modest size of the market of somewhere between 10%, 15% that will be priced only, and in that market, Henry Schein will continue to compete and compete very well, although on the major investment in the U.S., we do not even consolidate those sales. But I will say that the growth there is not much different to what it's been in the Henry Schein core business.","So, we need to invest in a lot of areas, of course, in the digital platform and in our value-added services in general, and I think those investments will be well worth it and continue to help us create shareholder value in the years to come.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Jon, let me just update the dental specialty growth. Actually, I looked at the number; it's a little bit higher on a global basis. I said mid-single digits, but on a global basis, it's almost 10%. So, I just wanted to update you on that.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys, for you time.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","So thank you all for calling in, really remain excited about where we're heading. I think we need to continue to invest in the business, as I described. I think we will continue to do well in our basic consumable and equipment businesses, dental, medical, vet, dental laboratory, and I'm particularly excited with the opportunity of increasing our operating profits, as a result of the work we're doing in the specialty areas and in the practice solution software areas, of course, all the while increasing efficiency in the business, while providing the best of products at the best value offering to our customers. So, we remain very excited about where we're heading. Steven can be reached at 621-843-5915. Carolynne Borders can be reached at 631...","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","...390-8105.","Stanley M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Susan Vassallo, Henry Schein's Vice President of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Susan.","Susan Vassallo","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss today's Henry Schein's third quarter results. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking.

As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.

Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.","[Operator Instructions] With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Susan. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. We are very, very pleased to have gained market share in each of our 4 business groups during the third quarter. Each group also reported accelerated internal sales growth, that is in local currencies, compared with the second quarter and after you exclude the impact of seasonal influenza vaccine from our Global Medical business. So adjusting for flu, which we'll talk about separately, and the results there are quite good, too, you'll see that internal growth has been positive in all of our business units and we have gained market share across the board.","We are also pleased today to be raising the low end of our 2012 EPS guidance range and to be introducing guidance for the year 2013 that represents growth in EPS of approximately 10% to 12% compared to the midpoint of our 2012 guidance range, and Steven can provide further color on that.","Looking at our business operations through 2 strategic acquisitions, we recently enhanced our dental software offering, in particular to dental schools, and expanded our veterinary footprint to include Ireland. These transactions illustrate our commitment to advanced technology and geographic expansion. Of course, these are 2 key initiatives in our 2012 to 2014 Strategic Plan.","I'll provide a little bit -- further thoughts on these acquisitions and some commentary on each of the business groups in a moment. So overall, we're quite pleased with our results for the third quarter. We think each of our business units is marching in a very solid way towards implementing our strategic plan, making progress.","And so let me now turn the call to Steve to provide further information on our quarterly financial results. Steve?","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to everyone. I'm also pleased to be reporting overall strong financial results and sales growth for the third quarter of 2012. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 29, 2012 were $2.2 billion, reflecting a 5.7% increase compared with the third quarter of 2011. This consists of 8.9% growth in local currencies and a 3.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales were up 4.4%, and our acquisition growth was 4.5%.","As Stanley mentioned, I'd like to point out that our seasonal influenza vaccine sales were lower this quarter than in the prior year's third quarter, although our profitability was higher. In order to provide more meaningful commentary, I will be discussing sales results including and excluding this impact.","So excluding sales of seasonal influenza vaccines from both periods, our net sales increased 6.4% and 9.8% growth in local currencies including a 5.1% internal sales growth rate. You can see the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued today.","Our operating margin for the third quarter of 2012 was 6.7% and declined slightly by 8 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2011. However, excluding the impact of current year acquisitions, our operating margin actually expanded by approximately 16 basis points compared with the prior year. And as we have previously discussed, acquisitions, until integrated, typically carry lower margins than our existing businesses and serve to reset our base operating margins.","If we look at our operating expenses as a percent of sales, they improved by 44 basis points as we continued to control and leverage our expense structure. This improvement was offset by a decline of 52 basis points in gross margin, and that's due mainly to our Global Animal Health business, which includes higher sales growth as well as product mix impact. And just to remind people, our Global Animal Health business has a higher percentage of its sales in pharmaceutical products, and these products carry a gross margin lower than our company average. So again, it's a mix issue.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, which is in line with our previous guidance and down from the 31.5% in the third quarter of 2011. We expect that our effective tax rate to remain in the 31% range or slightly lower for the remainder of the year. Net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the third quarter of 2012 was $96.8 million or $1.08 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 5.2% and 9.1%, respectively, compared with last year's third quarter.","I think it's also important to note that the foreign currency exchange -- translation exchange had a negative impact on our EPS, and for the quarter that negative impact was a little over $0.01 per share versus last year.","As a reminder, I'd like to point out that a $0.10 change in the dollar-euro exchange rates will have an impact on our quarterly EPS by approximately $0.015 of EPS on a quarterly basis.","So let's provide some detail on our sales results for the third quarter. Our Global Dental sales for the third quarter of 2012 declined by 0.3% to $1.1 billion. But this consists of 3.4% growth in local currencies and a 3.7% decline related to foreign currency exchange.","In local currencies, we had internally generated sale were up 2.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.1%. We believe that our overall dental sales growth in local currencies exceeded our estimates of what the market is growing, so we continued to gain market share. And if we look at our 2.3% internal sales growth in local currencies, and that's on a global basis, it's comprised of 3.1% growth in North America and 1.0% growth internationally.","I'll give you some detail on each of these figures. First, the 3.1% North American internal growth in local currencies included 2.3% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 5.6% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. The equipment growth continues to be very broad-based for us, with particular strength in our high-tech product lines.","The 1% international internal growth in local currencies included 3.4% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and a 4.5% decline in dental equipment sales and service revenue. The decline in international dental equipment sales reflect some economic challenges in many of our markets in Europe, but most notably in Italy. We also saw a modest decline in equipment sales in Germany, which reflects a tough comparable versus last year. And as you may recall, last year in Germany, we had the benefit from the biennial IDS trade show that we did not have this year.","Looking at our Global Animal Health sales, they were $598.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of 19.2%, which consists of 23.9% growth in local currencies and a 4.7% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales were up 9.1%, and acquisition growth was 14.8%. If we look at the components of our 9.1% internal growth, we can see that North America grew 12.2% and international grew 6.2%. The growth was primarily driven by sales of parasiticides as well as certain other vaccines in the animal health market. We believe we certainly gained market share in the Global Animal Health business, as we have done in previous quarters.","Turning to our Global Medical sales, they were $442.5 million in the third quarter. That's an increase of 4.2% and consists of 4.8% growth in local currencies and a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we have internally generated sales up 3.5%, and our acquisition growth was an additional 1.3%.","Looking at the components of that 3.5% growth, 3.8% was in North America, and 2.1% was a decline in our international business. As we said earlier, this year, we sold fewer doses of seasonal influenza vaccine than last year, but it's very important to point out that although sales from this product line were less in 2012 versus 2013, our profitability was higher -- 2012 versus 2011, sorry, our profitability was actually higher. In fact, we expect to achieve, on a full year basis for 2012, our full year profitability goals for flu vaccine, and there may actually be some upside to that also.","So if we exclude sales of seasonal flu vaccines from both periods, we had very strong medical sales growth in the third quarter of 8.4%, with 9.1% growth in local currencies and 7.6% internally generated. The 7.6% internally generated sales growth was 8.2% in North America and a 2% decline international. Here again we also believe we continue to gain market share in the North American segment of the Medical group and the North American segment is the largest portion of our medical sales, which represents more than 90% of our total Medical global business.","Turning to technology. Our Global Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $71 million for the third quarter, an increase of 14.1%, with 14.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we had internally generated sales of 11.2% and an additional 3.5% growth related to acquisitions. The components of that 11.2% growth was 12% in North America and 4.7% internationally.","We continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market during the third quarter. Remember, we had said at the beginning of the year that we expect to repurchase about $200 million to $300 million on an annual basis and we expect to be at the high end of that range for the full year 2012. And for the quarter, specifically, we repurchased approximately 760,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $77.52 per share, which is approximately $59 million. The impact of this repurchase on the third quarter was not material, although you will see that we did see some nice improvements in EPS on a year-to-date basis.","At the close of the third quarter, we still had $84 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock.","If we take a brief look at our balance sheet and some highlights. First, operating cash flow for the quarter was $78.5 million. That compares to $90.3 million in 2011's third quarter, and this minor decrease was related primarily to working capital and due primarily to temporary increases in inventory levels. We continue to believe we will have strong operating cash flow for the year, and that will be in excess of our adjusted net income excluding restructuring costs.","Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 41.1 days versus 42.1 days last year. Our inventory turns were down slightly from 6.6 turns last year to 6.3 turns this year.","And last, looking at our balance sheet, I'm pleased to report that in September, we closed on a new $500 million revolving credit facility. This new facility matures in September of 2017, so it's a 5-year facility. And it replaces our $400 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in September of 2013 so next year. We're very pleased to have expanded the credit line, and we also are very pleased that we've been able to secure favorable terms on that credit line.","So I conclude my remarks with discussing our 2012 and 2013 financial guidance. Due to the strength of our third quarter results, we are raising the low end of our 2012 diluted EPS guidance and now expect that EPS for the year to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.40. And this represents growth of 10% to 11%. And it compares to our previous guidance of $4.30 to $4.40, so we basically increased the bottom -- from the bottom half of the range by about $0.05 to the top half of the range.","Let me point out that the fourth quarter of 2012 has one less week compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Remember, we had that extra week last year. And as always, our guidance excludes restructuring costs and as for continuing operations, as well as any previously announced acquisition that does not include the impact of any potential future acquisition activity.","Looking at next year, we are introducing 2013 financial guidance as follows: for 2013, we expect diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $4.81 to $4.91, which represents a growth of approximately 10% to 12% compared with the midpoint of our 2012 guidance.","Again, the 2013 guidance is for continuing operations and includes any completed acquisitions or announced acquisitions but does not include any future acquisitions that may occur. It's important also to note that in determining our guidance for 2013, we took what we believe to be a realistic and somewhat conservative view of the overall economic challenges in the European Union, as well as the foreign currency exchange rates.","So with that, I'd now like to turn it back to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Let me review with you some highlights from the third quarter and recent weeks from our Global Dental, Global Animal Health, Global Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services business groups.","So let me start with the dental group. We believe that our dental -- our Global Dental group gained further market share in all of its business despite a challenging environment for the dental equipment in many of our markets. As Steven mentioned, sales of dental equipment declined fairly sharply in Italy during the quarter. And let me remind our shareholders that we're really the only national equipment provider in Italy. And having said that, in the scheme of things, the Italian business is not material to the entire Henry Schein business but is an important part of our European dental business. And we also saw modest decline in equipment sales in Germany versus a tough comparison to the prior year, which benefited of course from the biennial IDS trade show, which takes place again this coming March, this coming 2013 March. So we expect to see positive growth at that time. We remain confident in our dental strategy and look forward to continue to gain market share across the board in our Global Dental business.","And as Steve also noted, once again, North American dental equipment sales growth was particularly strong. At Henry Schein, we place considerable focus on advanced technology products. These products help our clients deliver high-quality patient care, while at the same time operating efficient practices. These products are also positioned to allow for the integration of various aspects of the practice, the various areas of practice management, and it's equipment that access to integrator, and it ideally positions -- the equipment and, of course, the software, shall we say -- and ideally positions Henry Schein for success with future high technology products.","As a good example of our commitment to bringing the latest in advanced technology products to our customers, we recently announced that Henry Schein was selected by 3M as the first qualified U.S. channel partner for a new digital impression system branded the 3M True Definition Scanner. We will sell, install and support the device, which will be offered as a standalone digital impression system at a price that we believe will change the economics of CAD\/CAM dentistry. In fact, it may be lower prices available in the future but for the quality of the 3M product that has been brought to market and is expected to be upgraded in the future, and for the price point, we think it will be a great value to our customers.","We will also offer customers who acquire the 3M True Definition Scanner the opportunity to have a full chairside CAD\/CAM solution through the integration with the E4D Design Center and the E4D Mill. This solution has already been validated by 3M as a trusted chairside connection, so we will be offering the connection as an upgrade option to users of the 3M system or as an integrated CAD\/CAM system. So I think you will see through the work we're doing in the marketplace that we have a terrific solution for the standalone scanner but also the standalone scanner in combination with the software and the milling system. And this is early times with tremendous amount of upside opportunity with various software and hardware systems that Henry Schein will bring to market over the years to come.  We're very, very excited with the progress being made by our practice solutions group, and Henry Schein is committed to being the go-to company for digital solutions.","And we now have the perfect choice for dentists who want an easy entry point into CAD\/CAM dentistry with a further option of having a full chairside milling solution as an add-on.  As another example of our commitment to innovation, late in the third quarter, we were named exclusive global distributor for Identafi Oral Cancer Screening Device. This is a small and really a terrific cordless handheld unit designed for in-office use to screen oral cancer and precancers. Henry Schein has been a leader in the oral cancer detection arena for well over a decade, and we are known for bringing excellent and innovative products to market in this area. This product, the Identafi Oral Cancer Screening Device, adds yet another very, very important component to our high-tech digital strategy. The product will become a core component of our Total Health Beyond The Mouth initiative,  which includes a number of areas that we're focused on, including of course, the whole area of oral cancer but also sleep apnea and many other areas.  So we're very, very pleased with the progress that our Global Dental business is making in terms of gaining market share and including on the consumable side but also on the equipment side. Of course, we'd be happy to provide further insight during the Q&A period.","So let's take a look at the Global Animal Health group. During the quarter, we continued to gain market share in the business, with particular strength here in North America in the U.S. market. After the close of the third quarter we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire C&M Vetlink, which is a leading distributor of animal health products in Ireland. In fact, we expect to close on the transaction by the year end. C&M Vetlink was founded nearly 40 years ago as a distributor of certain pharmaceutical products in Ireland. Today, C&M Vetlink distributes a wide variety of veterinary and companion animal products to veterinarians across Ireland and recorded, for the 12 months ended April 2012, approximately EUR 42 million. That's about $58.5 million in sales. About 80% of these sales are for large animals, which reflects the importance of dairy farming and livestock in the Irish economy. Generally, we're not focused on the farming and the livestock arena, but in Ireland, this is of particular interest to us. And the company, CMS, (sic) [C&M] has a very good market share, terrific know-how in this sector. We have similar know-how, by the way, in other countries, such as Switzerland, and the U.K. and Australia and New Zealand, but generally, our focus is on the companion animal side.","From a product perspective, the majority of CNM sales are for pharmaceutical products. We expect the impact of this acquisition on operating margins to be less than 5 basis points going forward. With their headquarters in Limerick and warehouse in Limerick and Dublin, C&M Vet Link has 46 team members, including 11 field sales representatives. The acquisition makes Henry Schein a leading Irish vet distributor and reinforces the established Henry Schein Animal Health U.K. base in the United Kingdom and indeed, throughout Europe. Our veterinary business now has a presence in 11 countries worldwide, including 9 in Europe and the United Kingdom.","So I think you can see we're doing quite well on the vet side. Sales are good. Market share growth is good, and I think that it would be fair to say not only in the U.S. but really in each of the markets that we're on the ground in outside of the United States. So Europe, United States, and I think we're progressing nicely in Australia and New Zealand as well.","So now let's take a look at the Medical Group international or the Global Medical Group. We're very pleased with third quarter growth. We sold approximately 6.8 million doses of influenza vaccine during the quarter. And as of today, we sold approximately 8 million doses, representing essentially all of the season's sales, down a bit from our expectations of approximately 11.6 doses (sic) 11.6 million doses, but I'd like to point out quickly that though we're selling fewer doses compared with 2012. The profit contribution to Henry Schein from this product line is greater than last year and in line with our internal growth. But there is no exposure on the purchasing side either. So we're quite happy with where we are on the flu side. It's a nice annual contribution and complements our terrific progress that we're making in our North America, or U.S., shall we say, Medical business. More than 90% of our sales, by the way, in our Global Medical business are from North America. Our continued gains in market share in North America reflect the increased penetration of integrated delivery networks. I think we're doing very well in this area. We're doing very well with larger group practices. And the ASC, the ambulatory surgery centers are also areas we're doing well, as well as solid growth in sales of pharmaceutical products and medical equipment products. All-in-all, we're really pleased with our U.S. in particular, medical business, which is doing very well.","We've developed a strategic plan 3 or 4 years ago in this area to focus on the newer areas of health care delivery, the IDNs, the larger group practices, the ASCs. And we're executing in a terrific way in this area and also focused on certain specialties and are doing well in that area.","Now on the European side, it's a relatively small business, I think less than $100 million, but something that is important to us. We recently announced that J\u00fcrgen Hahn, a very experienced medical executive, has joined Henry Schein to be the President of our European Medical Group. J\u00fcrgen has responsibility for Henry Schein's Medical full-service and mail order businesses in Europe. J\u00fcrgen is the ideal person to build our European Medical Group into the continental leader role that we currently hold with our Dental and, of course, our Animal Health businesses. He brings to us more than 20 years of experience in the medical business, including work at Novartis, Fresenius, and most recently, Hitachi. Although as of this stage, we have not spent a huge amount of resource in our European Medical Group, it's an area that we think we will do quite well with in the future, and it will be a terrific complement for our U.S. Medical Group.","Today, Henry Schein serves approximately 75,000 physician customers throughout Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Europe overall, we have a highly experienced team of more than 4,000 Team Schein members serving medical, dental and animal health practitioners. So I think you'll see that we have done well, of course, in our Animal Health business and our Dental business in Europe and are now positioned to continue to expand the business -- our overall business in Europe in the medical arena with some great management and using the base that we have developed on the dental and animal health side.","So let me conclude my prepared remarks with a discussion of our business in the Global Technology and Value-Added Services arena. The performance of this group continues to be solid during the quarter. Good sales growth, of course, terrific margins. More than 85% of revenue from this business is derived from North America, and core results include a particular strength in recurring revenue streams on both the technology and financial services sides of the business. We are, of course, committed to utilizing advanced technology and software to help all of our customers run more efficient businesses, whether in the dental, medical or animal health space.","Later in the third quarter, we acquired a majority interest, a very important strategic investment, in The Exan Group, which is a Canadian dental software company servicing dental schools and general practice dentists in the U.S. and in Canada. I think Exan's reputation, for example, in the dental school area is unsurpassed. And talk to any dental dean of a U.S. dental school, or perhaps even some abroad, and you will hear that reputation being confirmed. Exan has 82 members, including 76 at headquarters outside Vancouver. They recorded sales for the 12 months of approximately -- last 12 months of approximately $11.7 million. Of course, compared to our overall $9 billion or so in sales, it's not material, but Exan's value to Henry Schein from a strategic point of view is really important. There is a greater growing demand for enterprise systems, both in schools, dental schools and the dental, the group practice arena. And we think that Exan working in complement with our Dentrix unit here in the U.S. and our software at Exan systems organizations abroad will really make headway and provide terrific value to large practices and particularly schools throughout the world. Of course, Exan sales recorded in our Global Technology and Value-Added Services business unit.","So Exan's main product is a dental institution management software solution that is sold to approximately 65 dental schools representing the vast majority of dental schools here in the U.S. and Canada. Exan also has a practice management solution for general practitioners that's being used in approximately 750 practices; also has a very good French version of software, which we will be introducing in Qu\u00e9bec soon. Exan's dental software technology is well known for its excellent, tremendous success in the school arena and large practice area, and we're optimistic that the integration of the Exan line with Henry Schein's existing offerings of dental SOE and [indiscernible] will bring real value to our customers and improve on the stickiness of the relationship between our customers, helping them operate better businesses so they can provide better clinical care and at this event driving up our profits.","So that's a bit of flavor on our 4 business units. So before we open up for questions, let me highlight a new addition to our company's Board of Directors. In August, we announced that Carol Raphael had joined our Board. Carol will be a tremendous asset to Henry Schein, bringing to us a wealth of health care policy, economics and management experience. For more than 20 years, Carol served as President and CEO of Visiting Nurse Service of New York, which is, of course, the largest not-for-profit home health care agency in the United States.","She's credited with expanding the organization's services and launching innovative models of care for complex populations with chronic illness. She previously held executive positions at Mt. Sinai Medical Center and New York City government. Carol is an Advanced Leadership Fellow at the Harvard University, and she chairs the New York eHealth Collaborative, which is a public-private partnership working to advance the adoption of health information technology in the state of New York. As health care continues to evolve, Carol's Board experience will provide Henry Schein's Board with an important new perspective on this rapidly changing market and we're really excited that Carol has joined us as we take our medical business into a whole new world to complement the changes that are going to be evolving in the health care arena in the future. But also, Carol will be able to provide tremendous background information for the advances we're making in the dental arena and, of course, in the medical practice, the animal health practice arena as well.","So that's the overview. Steven and I are ready to take some questions. Operator, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elliot Feldman with Barclays.","Elliot Feldman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions, if I could. Maybe, even Stanley, for you, on the Medical side first. Obviously, a large acquisition taking place in the physician marketplace. Wondering if you have any perspectives broadly about going forward potentially how this transaction could impact you guys and maybe shift the competitive dynamics there, or is it still a little bit too early to tell there?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. Unfortunately, we do have competition, and there will always be competition out there. So I'm not sure whether the direct merger between the 2 companies you mentioned will impact us in any material way. Having said that, about 3 or 4 years ago, Henry Schein spent time undertaking 2 studies. One study was to review the methodology that we expect health care to be delivered in, in the future and how it would evolve. And the second was a study to determine what specialties to be focused on. We started implementing programs, strategies to support the results of those, the findings of that study. And I think we've done very well in focusing on the new entities, on the IDNs, the group practices, different kinds of ambulatory services that are now being used to deliver health care. And we're watching the acceleration of these trends. I think we've done very well with regard to capturing a lot of this business because we have very unique software services. And of course, our logistic capabilities in this regard are excellent. We expect to continue to make progress in this area. I think our results are quite clear -- 8% internal growth if you take out the flu vaccine. And I think you can expect us to continue to do well with these newer entities, as well as with the specialty areas that we've embarked on or focused on. So we remain very excited about our Medical group and are more focused on executing our plan than what our competition is doing and how they're merging. Having said that, I am sure that we will get some telephone calls from customers and others in the marketplace asking us to elaborate on how we are going to be operating, and I think we have a very good answer for the marketplace and very, very focused on executing our strategies in this area. We remain very excited, by the way, about our medical business and expect to invest heavily in that area over the years to come.","Elliot Feldman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. And one quick follow-up on that, maybe around capital allocation. As we look at 2013 and beyond, and you guys have clearly made some acquisitions here, consistent with your prior comments. Is the priority still M&A, particularly overseas as you guys continue to build out that scale that you talk about, Steve and Stanley, to build out your Dental and Animal Health platforms, particularly overseas and in Europe? And again, this is for Steve, really quick. Any share repurchase assumptions we should start building into our models for next year embedded in that guidance?","Steven Paladino","Okay. So on capital deployment, 2 things. One is similar to recent history, our goals are continue acquisition activity. It's not necessarily focus more outside the U.S. It happens to have been more outside the U.S. because it's a, a more fragmented market; b, there are no pan-European players other than Henry Schein so there's not a lot of additional competition for assets; and c, we have a smaller market share in Europe than we do in the U.S. But our focus is not necessarily outside the U.S. We'd like to do both in and outside the U.S. So ideally, with our free cash flow in the $500 million range, we'd like to spend $200 million to $300 million on an annual basis for acquisitions, cash acquisitions. We'd also like to spend an additional $200 million to $300 million in stock buyback. And as I said in the prepared remarks, for 2012, we'll be at the high end of that range, and we'd expect to continue it on an ongoing basis as a way to return capital to shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Stanley, just wondering if you could give us some color as to what's driving the market share gains in both Dental and Animal Health segments. Are you taking share from some of your larger competitors or are you taking it from the small guys?","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, I don't think I can give you specifics on the breakdown between whether it's coming from large competitors or our small competitors. But I would say in all 3 of our global business units, we are quite agnostic as to where the business was coming from. And I would say that our solutions-based sales approach of fielding what I think is today something like 3,400 field sales consultants spread out in the U.S. in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and now in Asia, all with the same goal of helping practitioners operate a better business so that those practitioners can provide better clinical care, train those field sales consultants, giving them the tools to get the job done, ranging from consulting capabilities to software to financial services software, practice management software and other kinds of software, prosthetic solutions in the dental world rather than selling a particular hardware, coming out with solutions. I think all that, the direct mail, the telesales capabilities allowing the field sales consultants to be available for consulting rather than ordertaking, real sales consultants working with key manufacturers, suppliers to introduce new products, all those working across the board and we've invested heavily in these areas for 1.5 decade, maybe 2 decades and it's working. So I don't want to get into any specifics as to which distributor in what country, which location we\u2019re taking business from, but I would think that in practically every one of our markets, we're gaining market share from some big competitors and some small competitors. So I don't think it's any easier or harder to get business from a small versus a large competitor. The small competitor may not have the tools but may have a deeper local community relationship. The bigger ones may have the tools but may have lost a little bit their way. So I would say from sitting here right now thinking of our 3 business units, I would say we're getting little bits of market share across the board.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick question for Steve. Looking at the cash flow, you gave us some detail on the working capital and inventory. So we're looking at possibly north of $300 million of operating cash in Q4, and then I see inventories are building on the balance sheet. Is there anything going on there in terms of special stocking for the Animal Health pharmaceuticals or vaccines or can you give us some color around that front?","Steven Paladino","You know we did see a little bit of inventory increases in Q3 that may continue in Q4. We just saw some good buying opportunities. It was really on a spot basis, so I can't say it's necessarily something that will continue. But we do have a sophisticated procurement model that when we see opportunities, we do buy in slightly. From an inventory risk perspective, it's virtually 0, I would say, because we're buying in a few weeks\u2019 extra supply, so there's really not an inventory risk and because capital costs are low, it's wise from a financial perspective. But I wouldn't say there's anything that I could point to, 1 or 2 things that would drive that. It's really being opportunistic in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Stan, I really appreciate all the detail you gave on the different business segments. But as I think about sort of the growth, the internally generated growth numbers you're putting up in your Medical segment in the mid to high single digits, I just want to -- curious if you can elaborate a little further, I mean. Were there any incremental products categories in either of those segments that may have been driving additional growth? Or do you really feel like it's just robust market growth with some market share on top of that? And I guess if you can give us a sense for how fast you think those 2 markets are growing, then we can figure out maybe how much of it is maybe benefiting from market share.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, Glen. That's a good question, so let me bifurcate it. On the Medical side, I don't think there's any one product. I mean, you've got to take out flu, right? I think there are in fact some challenges in that market because there's a shortage of certain pharmaceutical products, namely in the anesthetic area, and that tends to be go lumpy right now because -- and I think we had a little bit of suppression of sales in that area. But overall, I would say that on the Medical side, it's not product-driven. It's more driven from a movement of market share in some of these newer entities towards Henry Schein. And I would say that our core business in the small practitioner arena is quite stable, and so the growth is coming from this investment we started making a few years ago in that area and also I would say from some of the specialty areas that I think we're gaining market share. It's just a matter of focus. But I don't think it's from the introduction of any major product offering per se. On the Animal Health, it's a little different. I think we said this on prior calls. When looking at the Animal Health area, there's a couple of things you have to take into account. First, you've got to x out the large animal side in North America in particular. I don't think it's that important in Europe, but you have to x -- because Europe, we have a little bit of that, but the mix is not as profound as in the U.S. So in the U.S. when you look at the market growth of Animal Health, please take out the large animal health component and look at us from a pure companion animal point of view. Then the second thing is you need to look into a whole agency to full value sales GAAP accounting methodology, and there was some switch this quarter between agency sales to full reflection of the value of the sale from a GAAP accounting point of view, not material but some. That was to some extent offset by the loss of a prescription diet manufacturer that moved towards going direct and not working through distribution. And then I think the big swing is the whole Trifexis addition because that is an addition of a fully booked sale versus the competition to Trifexis, which I believe is an agency-booked sale. So you take all of that out. I think the market is probably growing somewhere around 2% to 5%. It's impossible to give specific data. There are about -- we set our board meeting for Butler Schein yesterday, and there's about 5 or 6 or 7 indexes and all of them are a little bit all over the place. Having said that, I think it's fair to say the market is growing at least 2% and it's not much more than 5% on the companion animal side. So the gain is related to a lot of what I just described, plus we are gaining market share. I think the fact that our sales organization is settled, our management in the field is settled, the offering is settled, commissions are settled. We have, I believe, the best value-added service offering in the marketplace. Our 2 software systems are doing well. The morale is great. And when an organization is winning, it's winning and it leads to more success. So I would say that our Butler Schein business in the U.S. is doing extremely well in gaining market share, although it's modest market share growth. And a lot of the other things I know that need to be taken into account in evaluating the performance of the business relative to market share growth. Again, I think it's probably not the best place on this call to go through this. But for those investors that have specific questions, I'm sure Steven will take you through the details. But it's quite complex, so we set it out in our Butler Schein Board meeting yesterday, and we spent at least 45 minutes trying to figure this all out. And it is very complex. And I think there are all sorts of dialogue on the Wall Street on this area that's not quite accurate.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. I appreciate those details. Maybe if I could ask you, Stan, one more follow-up. I was kind of curious about your comments you made with respect to some innovation within the scanner industry. It kind of sounds like with this new kind of 3M relationship, that's a new strategy I guess for Henry Schein. Does it -- are you worried about it sort of cannibalizing maybe your relationship with E4D in terms of front-end scanning? And you mentioned it's at a pretty interesting price point. Are you willing to share what the price point is of that new scanner and how do you think that maybe sort of disrupts the competitive continuum within that space?","Stanley M. Bergman","The first thing is I want to be very, very, very careful to start a competitive dialogue through Wall Street analysts between one manufacturer and another, so -- because we have seen this in dentistry. It's a very small industry and all sorts of positions can be taken by analysts, and it's not a good thing. It's not good for the dentist and it's not good for our industry. First, let may lay the philosophical background. Henry Schein has been in the solutions business for years and years and years. Over 2 decades ago, we saw that there was an opportunity in the practice solutions in the software area. There were 800 or 900 different systems in the early 90s. Henry Schein backed one, Easy Dental, and whether it was the best software or not, I can't tell you. But what I can tell you it was the best solution and I think we brought automation to the dental office. We then did the same in the electronic record medical arena for dentists with the Windows product of Dentrix. Whether it was the very best software or not, I cannot tell you. But what I can tell you it was the best solution. And supported by Henry Schein, having helped this simplified way of viewing it but a help that\u2019s available to practitioners and making automation of the practice easy. It's the same philosophy we have on the practice solutions area. We implemented. We outlined and installed a practice solutions -- global practice solutions enterprise about a year ago, and we've taken some of our best managers, and I covered that in the last call, and put them into this area. We are more interested in the solution than any one's particular software or any one's particular hardware. At the end of the day, we want to bring the digitalization of the impression and related prosthetic activity, whether its movement of data to a laboratory or movement of data chairside, moving of a crown or bridge, whether it's in a traditional prosthetics area or in the implant area. The total solution is what we are interested in. And that's what we have built our dental business around. So having said that, at this moment in time, there are 3 broad areas to be focused on, amongst other things. There is the scan, there is the software and there is the mill for chairside and also having applicability in the laboratory space. We are working with many manufacturers, some manufacturers in one country, some manufacturers in another country. And at the end of the day, our job is to bring the total solution. In this context, we have been working with 3M for a long time. We also work with other manufacturers in Europe, for example. But then you asked about 3M, particularly. 3M has invested in a scanner, but 3M has also invested in D4D. We about 1.5 year ago, could even be 2 years ago, started dialogue with 3M to see if we could take their scanner and integrate it with the D4D software, which will turn this integrator with a mill. And we've brought together I think what is a terrific offering at a great price point. But for the scan we think that the D4D software is quite advanced, I don't want to get into a debate if it's better for worse. It's best to ask a dentist that question or visit the greater New York meeting and make your own assessment. But we think it's a pretty good system and it may even be the best in certain regard. Certainly, the mill is very, very solid as well. And again without getting into debate through Wall Street, I think it's one of the best systems out there, if not the best for the chairside. We also offer a whole series of laboratory hardware and software, so we are focused on the solution. We will sell -- we will drive towards open technology. That is our philosophy. It's always been our philosophy. And those that want to connect to our system can connect. And those that don't want you, we believe in the end will either connect or they will have challenges because the marketplace has to dictate and not the manufacturer. So we will be open to technology and work with any manufacturer that will work with us. Our goal is to provide the best solution for the office-based practitioner for the whole prosthetics arena and, of course, tying their prosthetic solutions into our practice management software systems at a practice solution systems, in this country, Easy Dental; SOE aboard, et cetera, et cetera. Now you asked about the price of the 3M units; I don't know what it is exactly. But I think it's $10,000, $12,000. I'm not sure if the price per se is relevant. It's on the lower end relative to the quality, but when you go to the IDS show this coming year, my guess is you'll see 50 different kinds of scanning devices, maybe even more. And Henry Schein has to bring the best units to market for our customer, so that we can come up with the very best solution. And it's less about the particular device and more about the solution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Steve, the SG&A cost this quarter came in better than what I was looking for and it looks like a pretty decent sequential decline. Can you just comment on that? Is there any streamlining going on between North America and Europe distribution?","Steven Paladino","Sure. David, there was. Remember, we did some restructuring activities, and we are getting now the benefit of the restructuring activities, so that's, I think, the driver. We're also -- given the economic times, we're also really looking to manage our expenses very tightly. We don't have any hiring freezes or things like that, but we really justify any new hire that comes on board. We really want to make sure that we're not having our expense structure get ahead of market growth and sales growth activity, so it's really a combination of the restructuring and really trying to manage expenses very tightly, so it's both activities. And we're hopeful that we'll continue that into the next year as we do think the economic climate will continue to be choppy and difficult.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Great. And then also, your global technology growth rate, 11.2%, can you just talk about that? Are you seeing any continued benefit from the high-tech act like some of the doc offices? Or is that being driven mainly to practice management solution sales of dental offices. Could you just touch on what drove that growth rate, please?","Steven Paladino","Sure. It's really not on the medical side related to EMR. We have a small business there, so it's really -- it's not that. It's really driven by our dental business, as well as we included in the value-added service part of the technology our financial services business. Both of them had very strong growth. On the technology side, it's really not driven by new units. It's really driven by additional recurring revenue activities, annual technical support, claims processing, credit card processing, things like that, billing for our customers' patients. So really, we like that because it is on the recurring revenue side and it's both domestic as well as international. And you know, if you look historically, we've had very strong growth in this area for a number of quarters. And we do expect it to continue given our platform of users, where we have really the largest global platform of users in the dental, medical and animal health -- excluding medical. Medical, there\u2019s some bigger ones. But in dental and animal health, we certainly have the largest user base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So Stanley, it sounds like, if I'm hearing you correctly on this call, maybe a little more focused on M&A in Medical internationally. If I look domestically, the most fragmented market across your businesses to me would seem to be Medical. And obviously, in light of the proposed acquisition in that space, I was wondering if maybe you could just comment on your appetite for consolidation or your view on consolidation of the medical distribution space, particularly in ambulatory here domestically.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. I think we are and have been committed a couple of decades now to continuing to consolidate all 3 markets: dental, medical, animal health and of course, together with value-added services, in this country and abroad. So we will continue with our strategy of acquisitions, I think we do about 20 a year, and we also will continue with our strategy of focusing resources on those areas in these markets that we think lend themselves towards internal growth. We have a very good strategic plan that we started with from January 1, 2012. And at the end of 2014, I think we know exactly what we're going to do. We've got our 3 business groups: Dental, Medical, Animal Health, as well as our practice management -- Value-Added software businesses focused on global agendas. And in that regard, I think you can expect acquisitions across the board in this country and abroad, all in pursuit of advancing the office-based practitioner business and the ambulatory business that we are focused on. I don't think we're going to stray beyond that. We may enter into dialogue and alliances with different people, but that's what we're going to focus on.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then Steve, if I could maybe just ask one a little bit around the outlook. I just wanted to see if you would be willing to share a little bit more segment-level detail behind the guidance, maybe even qualitatively. As I look at Dental specifically, this year looks like you're on pace for global internal sales growth somewhere around 3%. I was wondering based on what you're seeing today how you're expecting that to trend as we move into 2013.","Steven Paladino","Sure. Dental, I wouldn't say any major changes in dental, although we are trying to be cautious in our outlook in European dental, especially in some markets like Italy, which are going through some difficult times. I would say, when you look at Dental, Medical and Animal Health businesses, I think you'll see similar growth rates that we're expecting as over the last couple of quarters that we've gotten. There may be some minor upticks and downticks individually, but I think from a trend perspective, very similar to what we've seen over the last couple, few quarters.","Operator","We do have time for one more question from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just expanding on Bob's question. Steve and Stan, if you look across your 3 major segments, other than Italy, are you seeing any other areas where you're noticing there's deterioration or maybe even strengthening, particularly in Dental?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I think it's sort of mixed bag, John. I don't think there's anything that's really bad other than Italy. And I don't think there's anything that's really, really good other than perhaps China. So the middle is somewhere around flat to slightly positive. So if you look at our European business, you'll see that the consumables were up by 3.4% internal growth. That definitely takes into account that we're gaining market share. Whether the market is growing by 1% or so percent, I can't tell you because the data's not available but it's not growing by 3%. And I don't think its aggregates are going backwards on the consumables side. So I think France is okay. The U.K. has challenges. We covered that before. I think we're gaining market share there. And Germany on the consumable side is okay. I think we should be more or less okay going for the balance of this year. But generally, the market on the equipment side kind of freezes until the IDS and then picks up again. That's just the way the German market works. Of course, Spain is terrible, but it's been terrible for a while, so the comparables are not that bad. There's some odd things going on in the Netherlands relative to reimbursement. I think that should be sorted out. And Australia and New Zealand, it's a funny economy. It's bifurcated. There's a part of the economy that does very well because of the commodities. In that part, we're doing well. The high-end dentists are doing quite well. And then you've got the part of the economy where people are just not keeping up because of whatever it is -- lack of employment, et cetera. And so dentists in those parts of Australia are not doing well. New Zealand is okay. And so as I'm thinking through the world, I don't see any areas that are particularly bad other than, as you pointed out, Italy and Spain. And I don't think there's any booming areas really. Canada's okay. It's been okay throughout the recession period, and so if you look at Animal Health, I think we grew internally. It's something like 6% outside of the U.S. That's definitely a growth in market share. That's definitely not the rate of growth in those markets, again the markets may be growing at 1\/2 that number. So overall I think we're gaining market share. And the markets we're in are, I mean, positive territory but not hugely positive.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","That's really helpful, Stan. One last question. I don't think you've kind of talked about how the specialty dental markets are performing relative to the general dentistry. Are you seeing any interesting changes there?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. So of course, Henry Schein can't be a gauge because our market share is relatively small. But I do think, at least in the third quarter, from what our management is telling us, is that orthodontics and implants did not do well as a market. I\u2019m just referring to Henry Schein, and even the endodontic to some extent. There was some kind of a malaise in that area in the third quarter. At least, that's what our management is telling us. We're not the biggest player. But in aggregate, we started to have several hundred million dollars of business. So I think we can talk with a little bit of authority, but we are by no means a big player in any of those markets. In specific countries like Germany in implants, we are a big player. And in endodontics in the U.S., we're a pretty good player. But generally, I don't think we are impacted that much by the economics in those particular sectors rather than the impact of a relatively small market share gaining market share. So we end up in the positive territory by and large, but having said that, I think the underlying market is not necessarily doing that well. At least, that was in the third quarter, and I think we're a little more optimistic in the fourth quarter from a market point of view. Sorry, we ran out of time. So thank you, all, for your questions. I think Steven's available at (631) 843-5915. I don't call the number that much anymore because you can walk into my office, and Susan at 5562. And of course, as usual, we'd be very pleased to entertain specific questions from those who are interested in our business. We remain optimistic about the business. Hopefully, now that we\u2019ve left the U.S. elections behind us, there will be certainty and it will be perhaps a bit more economically positive environment. Sandy did have, of course, an impact on the business; not material. Our overall sales seems to be holding up, but I think on the one hand, I think patients are going to have a challenge going to see some doctors. But on the other hand, there will be more investment in equipment going forward. So we don't know the full impact. It's not going to be material to Henry Schein as a company, but there will be I think some impact on specific businesses and specific locations. So we're very excited about the company. We're executing well through our strategic plan. The morale is good, and I look forward to seeing some of the people on this call at the greater New York meeting at the end of this month. And if not, have a good balance of the year and a happy holiday season. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Susan Vassallo, Henry Schein's Vice President of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Susan.","Susan Vassallo","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's fourth quarter results. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company\u2019s business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.

Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. ","I ask that during the Q&A portion of today's call, you limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up before returning to the queue. This will provide the opportunity for as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour we have allotted for this call. ","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Good morning, and thank you, Susan. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We are delighted to have gained market share in all of our business groups during the fourth quarter and in fact, for the full year of 2011. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced overall middle -- mid-single-digit internal growth and that's adjusting, in fact, reducing the actual sales growth or sales rate of growth for the extra week. And of course, we complemented the internal growth with growth as a result of strategic acquisitions.","For the year, we are proud that we exceeded $8.5 billion in sales. The team has done a remarkable job in garnering market share growth through internal growth and of course, absorbing the acquisitions that were made in the previous year. If you think about it, we had $6 billion of sales in 2008 and took that to $7.5 billion in 2010. And for the full year of 2011, we had $8.5 billion of sales. ","Overall, our view is that the markets we serve are modestly improving. We think we are off the bottom and are growing in all of our markets, and we look forward to the return of historic growth rates, 5% to 6% annually, in the long run as the baby boomer generation understands the importance of preventative care in the medical and dental arena and as the market continues to develop throughout the world with a companion Animal and Equine business. So in a moment, I'll provide some commentary on each of our businesses but first, I'll ask Steve to provide an overview of our quarterly financial results. Thank you. Steve?","S. Paladino","Okay, thank you, Stan, and good morning to everyone. I'm also very pleased to be reporting solid sales and earnings growth for the fourth quarter of 2011. Before I begin, let me point out that the fourth quarter of 2011 included one additional selling week compared with the fourth quarter of 2010, and that week is the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's. This occurs approximately every 6 years for Henry Schein, given that we are on a 52-, 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. We have estimated the impact of the extra week and I'd like to point out that this estimate is not a precise calculation, although we are very comfortable with the estimate. And that's mostly related to equipment and technology sales, which are larger ticket items and are significant investment decisions on the part of our customers. And that decision is not likely to be proportionately impacted by the inclusion of an extra week during the quarter. So in order to provide a more meaningful commentary, we have provided separate estimates on the impact of sales growth for that extra week, as well as the internal sales growth figures excluding that extra week.","So turning to our financial performance. Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, were $2.3  billion, reflecting a 15.6% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Internally generated sales were up 5.3% with only 0.1%, a decrease due to foreign currency exchange and acquisition growth was 4.7% and the growth estimated to be attributable to the extra week was approximately 5.7%. Sales of seasonal influenza vaccines during the quarter did not have a significant impact on our sales growth for the quarter. You can see the details of our sales growth that are contained on Exhibit A in our earnings news release that was issued earlier today.","Our operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 7.0%. It declined slightly by 4 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. However, excluding the impact of current year acquisitions and sales of influenza vaccines from both periods, our operating margin expanded by approximately 24 basis points compared with the prior year's quarter. ","As we have historically discussed, acquisitions typically carry a lower margin than our existing business until we integrate them and serve to reset our base operating margin. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.9%, which is in line with our previous guidance and is down slightly from the 31.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2012, we estimate that our effective tax rate will continue to be in that 31% range.","Our net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $104.7 million or $1.15 per diluted share. This represents growth compared to the 2010 fourth quarter of 12.6% and 15%, respectively.","Taking a look at our financial performance for the full year, I am pleased to report that we achieved a number of good milestones, including sales growth of 12%, again, adjusting for that extra week; growth in diluted EPS of approximately 11% compared with the prior-year EPS on a non-GAAP basis; and free cash flow was extremely strong of $509.5 million for the year and that exceeds our net income and is in line and actually, in excess, of our corporate goal. So we're very proud to have exceeded the EPS goal that we stated more than a year ago during, we believe are difficult and uncertain economic times.","Now I'd like to provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Our North American Dental sales for the quarter increased 11.9% to $806.6 million. Internally generated sales were up 4.5% with a 0.1% decline related to foreign exchange and growth attributable to the extra week of 7.5%. Our consumable merchandise sales increased 4.8% in local currencies and that's all internally generated and also adjusted for the extra selling week. And on a same basis, our Dental equipment sales improved and increased to 3.8% in local currencies, again, all internally generated and all adjusted for the extra week. ","Our North American Medical sales were $373.3 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 13.9%. This consists of internally generated sales of 7.1%, approximately 0.7% growth related to acquisitions and 6.1% growth attributable to the extra week. We are really very pleased to continue to gain market share in our North American Medical business. Again, sales of seasonal influenza vaccines did not have a meaningful impact on our Medical sales growth for this quarter.","Turning to our North American Animal Health business. Animal Health sales were $255.9 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 14.9%. This consists of internal sales growth of 7.2% and growth attributable to the extra week of 7.7%. As we have previously discussed on prior conference calls, now that the Butler and Henry Schein Animal Health businesses have been completely integrated, we are seeing the benefits of our coordinated sales efforts and that is driving the sales growth. ","International sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $833.8 million, an increase of 20% compared with the prior year's fourth quarter. Internally generated sales growth was 4.8%, acquisition growth was 12.2% and growth due to the extra week was 3%. The foreign exchange impact on international sales was really insignificant this quarter. If we look at some components, that 4.8% internal sales growth includes 4.4% in our international Dental business and 6.3% growth in our international Animal Health businesses. And these businesses represent approximately 65% and 32%, respectively, of our International business.","Technology and Value-Added Service sales for the fourth quarter were $70.7 million, up 23.1% compared with the prior year's quarter and this consists of internal sales growth of 2.4%, growth attributable to the extra week of 6.5% and acquisition growth of approximately 14.2% due to the acquisitions of McAllister and ImproMed. ","During the fourth quarter, we saw particularly strong growth in our Electronic Services and Financial Services businesses. With respect to stock repurchase, we continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter. More specifically, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock during the quarter at an average price of approximately $61.98 per share and that's translated to approximately $68 million of cash. The impact on the repurchase of our shares for the fourth quarter on diluted EPS was a little less than $0.01 per share.","Let's take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter. Again, our operating cash flow for the quarter was extremely strong, $277.8 million. That compares to $216.6 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the year was $554.6 million. And as I mentioned earlier, we are extremely pleased to have achieved and exceeded our goals of having operating cash flow. In fact, free cash flow exceed our net income. ","Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 39.3 days for the fourth quarter. That's slightly down compared to 40.8 days in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full-year basis, days sales outstanding were 40.6 days. ","Inventory turns for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 6.8 turns. That's up compared to 6.7 turns in the fourth quarter of last year and a full-year basis, they were also 6.7 turns. CapEx for the year 2011 was $45.2 million, and we expect capital expenditures for next year, 2012, to be in the $45 million to $55 million range for 2012.","So moving to some of our strategic priorities. One of those that Stanley will discuss later is optimizing our cost structure and our processes and to that end, we have announced today that we are implementing a small restructuring with the goal of improving profitability. We expect to record restructuring charges of somewhere approximately between $11 million to $13 million or $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share. And this will occur during the first half of 2012 as a result of this action.","I'd like to conclude my remarks by reaffirming our 2012 financial guidance as follows. We expect 2012 diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.34 and that represents a growth of 7% to 9% compared to our actual 2011 results. I'd like to point out a couple of things with respect to that guidance. First, it's important to recognize that 2012, that fiscal year includes one less week compared to 2011. Our guidance also excludes the one-time restructuring costs and as always, our guidance is for current continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. ","So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven, very much for your update and I'd like to now provide a little bit color on the business units.","So let me begin with the North American Dental business. That's our dental business in the United States and in Canada. The results for our North American Dental business was strong across the board and reflects steady patient traffic to our Dental customers' offices and higher demand for dental equipment. Of course, this was partially driven by the tax incentives that were in effect for 2011. ","Internal growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise in local currencies was 4.8% during the quarter, excluding the extra week. So I think it's best to look at it excluding the extra week, which is solidly ahead of our estimate for the market growth and shows the strength of our Dental franchise here in the United States and in Canada. And our dental equipment results turned positive for the quarter with internal growth in local currencies at 3.8%. Again, if you should take out the extra week and this is after taking out the extra week. And as I noted during our last quarter call, we entered the fourth quarter with a strong backlog of equipment orders, including some that occurred in the -- early in the fourth quarter due to the timing of the end of the third quarter. I think we provided some color on this during the third quarter conference call.","So overall, I think we continue to be happy with our North American Dental businesses. They're doing well, gaining market share. The team has high morale and overall, the management is doing a very good job.","Now let's take a look at the North American Medical team and their performances. The team also, by the way, is doing a very good job. Happy with the management to that team and how they're leading us through some of the changes in the physician environment. The performance was good, very good, actually during the quarter, with internal growth well in excess of our estimate for the market growth. ","During the fourth quarter, we distributed about 1.7 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines as planned, bringing our total for the year to 11.6 million doses, with sales of approximately $88 million. We expect to distribute a similar number of doses in 2012. We are quite comfortable with the current supply agreements for seasonal flu vaccine, and the profitability for these products in 2012 is expected to be potentially a little higher the comparable numbers for 2011. The team on the -- so overall, very good North American Medical performance. I think we're doing well with -- working very well on taking advantage of the change in dynamics with respect to the consolidation in that field and expect to continue to garner market share in the next year or so.","So let's now turn to the North American Animal Health business, where we continue to be very pleased with the results of that team's performance. This business, we believe, is growing well in excess of the market. Again, remember, in North America Animal Health, we are focused virtually exclusively on the companion animal side. So I think when trying to understand the market share growth in this sector, it's very, very important to understand that we are only focused on the companion animal side in this country.","Our sales growth is due primarily to expanding the breadth and depth of our product offerings and to strengthen relationships with our customers. We recently acquired all of the Oak Hill Capital Partners' interest in Butler Schein Animal Health, and Henry Schein now owns 71.7% of this business. Since its formation 2 years ago, Butler Schein Animal Health has performed exceedingly well. Today, it is one of the anchors in our leading global Animal Health business, which has annual sales in the United States, in Europe and Australia and New Zealand of approximately $2 billion on a GAAP reported basis. And from a strategic perspective, the Butler Schein Animal Health joint venture is yet another example of the benefits to Henry Schein and to our partners in structuring such partnerships, which benefit all parties. So we're very pleased with the leadership of our Animal Health business in North America with the partnership we had, which included the Oak Hill Capital Partners and now is a partnership between us and the Ashkin Family, and we couldn't be happier with the way this has turned out from a financial point of view, from a strategic point of view and from a partnership point of view.","So now let's take a look at our international operations, which also featured solid sales growth in our Dental, Medical and Veterinary businesses and of course, was complemented by the acquisition of Provet Holdings in Australia and New Zealand and that is now annualized out. On prior fourth quarter, we had strong growth in dental equipment, in part because of the various tax incentives in Australia and New Zealand. Against that tough comparison, our international group had very good rates of growth and so it's really important to take out -- to take in account the tremendous sales in Australia and New Zealand in the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result of this, tax incentives had expired and if you take that out -- you take that into account, the results for this year were really very, very impressive on the international side. ","Early in January, we acquired Veterinary Instrumentation, which is the leading supplier of surgical instruments and implants to veterinary surgeons in United Kingdom, not a material company in terms of sales, $11 million. But the company, which was founded by John Lapish, who began his career in the late 70s as an orthopedic animal health surgeon, focused on small animals. Dr. Lapish started designing and developing instruments for his own use and as the word got out to the other veterinarians and the demand for these products increased, he formed Veterinary Instrumentation. This acquisition holds strategic importance to Henry Schein, not only of course in the U.K. but globally. And we look forward to bringing the portfolio of high-quality specialty products to a growing number of professionals across Europe, here in the U.S. and in Australia. So overall, the international team and we could, of course, add more color if anybody has any more specific questions, did very well. I think it is fair to say that there are some challenges in Europe. But overall, the key markets are markets that we are comfortable with, that we will continue to grow our market share and our profitability.","So now to the Technology and Value-Added Services business. We once again had a strong growth including the successful integration of strategic acquisitions. Indeed, total growth in this business has exceeded 20% for 5 consecutive quarters. As Steven mentioned, our Electronic Services and Financial Services businesses continue to be particularly strong. ","So I'm very pleased with the management team and the performance of our Practice Solutions business here in the United States, on the Dental side, on the Animal Health side and particularly pleased with the performance of our SOE business on the Dental side. Also they now have some veterinary businesses in the U.K., Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and looking forward to expanding our software franchise outside of the United States. ","Also Henry Schein Financial Services had a especially good quarter and the market share of our equipment sales that is being financed by Henry Schein Financial Services is growing, and I think is a very good, by any standards, with actually potential to increase our market share in the future as well. So overall, our Henry Schein Value-Added Services business, Software and Financial Services had another great quarter.","So that's very high level 60,000 feet high, take a look at our 2011 accomplishments. Looking back at the year as a whole, 2011 has been both challenging and high rewarding as we faced dynamic changes in our businesses. What's going on? Although there remains uncertainty in the global economy, we believe that Henry Schein is well positioned for the future and is affected by macro-economic factors to a far lesser extent compared with other areas of healthcare and specifically, industry at large. So let's take a moment to cite a few highlights from 2011.","First, we did complete a number of strategic acquisitions last year. On the Veterinary side, we closed our purchase of Provet Holdings, which is Australasia's largest distributor of veterinary products with annual revenues of about $280 million at the time of our acquisitions. I just visited with the team in Australia and New Zealand last week and the morale is good. We've gotten through the challenges of integrating into a larger business public company like Henry Schein very well, and I think the team is doing a great job. They have their eyes set on taking the business north into Asia and very, very pleased with the team that they're putting together to do just that as well. ","We also acquired majority ownership positions in McAllister Software Systems and their AVImark practice and the AVImark practice management system, which is part of the McAllister Software Systems and the most popular actually practice management system. And then ImproMed and the Infinity practice management software product was also acquired and of course, ImproMed is a high-quality system. AVImark, too, but ImproMed is also particularly feature-rich. So between these systems, we have now combined sales in the Animal Health Software business of close to $25 million and we believe from a market point of view, have the same positioning as we have on the Dental Software space in North America and in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and Ireland.","On the Medical side, we acquired a relatively small but strategically important company, Alpha Scientific, which strengthen our presence in the very important medical markets in Southern California. Alpha Scientific had sales of $10 million in 2010. If we take a look at the International Dental business, we are very pleased with the performance of the acquisition in southeastern France, a very strategic acquisition. The Sogim Grimouille business which, in 2010, had sales of $20 million but the strategic value is much greater than the sales. So that's a little bit on the strategic acquisition side.","Now second several notable highlights, we're looking 2011 financial performance should be mentioned. Net sales reached a record $8.5 billion, representing approximately 12% growth on a comparable week basis. It's actually, on a GAAP basis, higher but taking out that extra week, takes it down to 12% growth. That's several times the growth of the marketplace -- the average marketplace of our 3 major business segments. EPS, diluted, increased by approximately 11% on a non-GAAP basis. And we generated almost $510 million of cash flow, which substantially exceeds our net income for the year. ","So overall, financial performance was very good. And the third highlight and testament to the strength of our market position and our future business prospects is that in March -- sorry, in mid-August of 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of $200 million of shares of common stock. This program was additive to the $100 million repurchase program announced in November of 2010. During 2011, we repurchased approximately $200 million of stock, and we expect to continue buying shares during 2012 as part of our ongoing stock buyback program. ","So now let me conclude with our thoughts on the future. We are very, very, very excited about our portfolio we have assembled, the markets we're in, dental, the physician marketplace and the veterinary marketplace. And with this in mind, we entered into a strategic and organizational development plan process in 2011. And specifically, over the last 6 months or so, members of our executive management team had been engaged in the process of developing and documenting Henry Schein's 2012 to '14 strategic plan. Our vision, our goal, the question we answered was what would we like Henry Schein to look like on January 1, 2015 and to create the appropriate strategies and focus to achieve this vision. One of the measured goals from a financial point of view was for us to aim at generating sales in excess of $2 billion -- I'm sorry, $10 billion along with improved profitability. And our goal is not to leave that to the last day of the strategic plan but to build up the $10 billion relatively soon. So that's aspirational, but I don't think it's too far of a reach. And if you look at our track record, our $6 billion in 2008, $7.5 billion in '09 and in '10 and $8.5 billion in '11, I think the trajectory would lead one to be comfortable that our aspiration is realistic. Of course, we're not providing guidance on this. This is entirely an internal aspiration.","At the core of our initiatives to support this plan and our financial goals in the establishment of a -- is the establishment of a global, highly customer-centric group of business units. We are, in fact, establishing 3 and then we score customer-centric business groups, the global Dental group, the global Medical group and the global Animal Health group, as well as the global Technology and Value-Added Services group. At the same time, we will be strengthening our company-wide functions, that are used by these 3 groups to advance their business, namely, our Global Services, our Business Development, our Financial Services, Legal Services as well. In fact, beginning with the reporting of financial results for the quarter -- first quarter of 2012, we will be providing net sales and sales comparisons for each of these 3 global vertical groups that I just mentioned: the Dental, Medical and Animal Health global vertical groups. ","Importantly, we believe that the formation of these global business groups will provide distinct organizational focus for reaching each of our practitioner segments, and we will do so with the benefits of a global perspective, which I think is very, very important to understand. Our suppliers are global. Our customers have a lot in common throughout the world and we need to think global but act local. And we need to think that way for strategy and on the operational side and of course, with respect to our global products and services offering and global best practices. So it's global thinking at Henry Schein and the process that we began 20 years ago of being the first distributor in our field to be really reaching global goals is well underway. We have an outstanding global management team that are culturally and internationally competent.","So we have an overarching corporate goal of global leadership in servicing healthcare practitioners in an office or ultimate care setting and of recognizing -- recognition by our customers as meeting the changing needs by providing superior value and experience. These are not hollow words. This is the series of goals that we've set for ourselves and we've always, traditionally always met the goals we've set for ourselves. ","To achieve these goals, we have identified 6 priorities. First, the very first priority is pursue growth on a global scale and the market is somewhere north of $30 billion globally. It depends on how you define it and we have $8.5 billion, at least 1\/2 of the market is still in the hands of relatively undercapitalized competitors. So there's really lots and lots of opportunity to continue the growth of the company in new geographies and keeping our relations with current customers in Dental, Medical and Animal Health arena. We have no plans, by the way, to go beyond the businesses that we're in. There's too much opportunity, and we want to focus on further consolidation of these markets and bringing further value-added services to market so that we can help our customers run a better business. So that they can provide better clinical care.","So the first is to pursue global growth and to increase our scale. The second goal is the optimization of our cost structure and processes, where we have already begun to take actions Steven previously noted earlier on in the conference call. The third is priority -- the third priority is a commitment to continue development of our human capital, recognizing that Team Schein remains our most valuable asset. We've invested the team for decades and continue to view this as investing in our team as one of the most important, if not, the most important investment the company could make. ","The next goal is superior relationships with our suppliers with continued focus on branded, exclusive and private-label products. Our customers, our suppliers are critical to us, and we want those suppliers that work well with us to understand that the best place for them to do business is Henry Schein and that they will make more money and be more successful by doing business with Henry Schein than with any of their other customers. ","Our fifth priority is satisfying our customers' clinical and business needs, which is actually critical in a dynamic business environment. So we need to understand what's on our customers' minds and in the sixth goal, is the commitment to deliver innovative customer solutions that meet our customers' clinical and business needs today and in the future.","The various initiatives under our 2012, 2014 strategic plan reflect how far we have come as a company, and it's a real recognition of the size and scope of our organization. ","In 1990, our revenues were $236 million, primarily in the Dental Mail order business. In 2011, our revenues exceeded $8.5 billion and in 1990, we were just starting to enter countries beyond the U.S. Today, our International business generates some $3 billion in sales to practitioners in more than 200 countries with operations on the ground in 23 countries outside of North America. So the offering has significantly expanded from the Mail Order Consumable business to the most comprehensive array of consumables, equipment, software, financial services and other value-added services than any company in our space has to offer. So the performance -- the aspirations are good and the delivery on those aspirations from a performance point of view was excellent and our team -- we really appreciate the hard work and effectiveness of our team.","So as we look back on the 20 years since we implemented our first globalized strategic plan, as we look back on the period since we have become a public company in November of 1995, I think it is fair to say that we've done a good job. We set goals. We deliver on them, not always in exactly the month we wanted to, but if you look at the track record going back to the 65 or so quarters, I think you will see that the track record is very, very good. And let me take this opportunity to thank the team, our suppliers, our customers and our investors for working with us to achieve these goals. ","So operator, I think we have time now for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Maybe if I could just ask going back to the dental strength in the North American Dental, obviously, encouraging to see strength both in the consumables and equipment. I understand, particularly, in equipment in the fourth quarter, some of that could be just this normal seasonality of year-end buying and so forth. Can you step back and say how much do you think is an underlying strengthening on the ongoing tone of North American Dental? And how much might have just been a strong year-end push?","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, first of all, by the way, it's a very good question. First of all, every year, we have a fourth quarter that is driven by year-end buys. Of course, the greater New York meeting is the shopping place for year-end buys and every year, we have a tax consideration because, very often, dentists and even doctors or veterinarians for that matter, sit with their accountants in October, November and they make their financial decisions -- their planning decisions based on tax considerations. So I think fourth quarters always have the same dynamic. Having said that, the mood, I think, in dentistry is pretty good right now. Even during recession times, it was okay. There were 4, 5 quarters where the mood was not good. But right now, I would say the mood is good. Traffic in the offertory is solid. In some places, it's constant. In others, it's going up. And I don't think there are many parts of the country, although there are some, where traffic is actually going down. So I would say, the mood in the dental world today, from our perspective, is quite good.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then maybe my follow-up would be just to understand on the restructuring. I'm sure others will ask questions here to. It seems like there is sort of an aspect of it that is to streamline efficiencies, particularly, in the international side that's sort of immediate and then there's some more global long-term strategic repositioning of the divisions. But in the short term, on the international operations, is there immediate cost savings that are benefited from this $0.08 to $0.10 restructuring charge? Will there be ongoing cost savings from that, that you can point to?","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, Steven will respond to the ongoing number. But just let me confirm to you that this is really part of a global reorganization to bring our organization into alignment with our strategic plan, to establish the 3 global verticals: Dental, Medical, Animal Health and to provide these business units with the resources they need to implement the strategic plan. So in certain parts of the business, we need to taper down our resources. In other parts of the business, we need to advance additional resources. So I think we've spoken, in the past, to shareholders about additional management resources we brought on board, both for succession purposes but also to bring us new skills that are required to implement our strategic plan. So on one side, it's bringing down spend in a certain part of the company and on another side, it's advancing resource spend in the areas that are important to advance the company on these 3 verticals and implementing our strategic plan. Having said that, Steven can give you comments on how this is likely to impact our actual expense -- expansion in the company.","S. Paladino","Yes, we do expect it to have a cost savings that will be ongoing. I would point out, though, for 2012, because the restructuring efforts are spanning the first half of the year, at best, we get 1\/2 year benefit from those restructuring efforts in 2012. But we do think that it will bring ongoing cost savings. There's really 2 activities. There's some elimination of some positions, although that's a smaller piece of it. There's also some facility closings -- some smaller facility closings. So those will have continued ongoing benefits. Again, at best, 1\/2 of that benefit is in 2012 and we're trying to be conservative on that in our guidance also. But we do look forward to bring ongoing benefits into 2013 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, just wanted to start on the operating margins. I know the goal, the annual goal is usually for 30 to 50 basis points of expansion. Looking at the 4Q results, top line growth really strong but didn't seem to necessarily translate to the operating margin line. I guess, maybe, just what kind of top line growth do you feel you need to see a little bit more leverage in the P&L? And then, I guess along those lines, following on AJ's questions, is that in part what the restructuring is intended to help do, create a little bit more leverage in the model?","S. Paladino","Quick answer to the second part of your question is yes, it helps to obtain additional leverage. But let me just point out, for Q4, when you exclude the current year acquisitions and the impact because of lower profitability on flu vaccine sales, we actually got 24 basis points of operating margin expansion. So it's still a little bit below our goal and it's only for Q4. So we believe after restructuring efforts but even beyond that, the ability to leverage incremental sales growth, you probably need at least mid-single digit internal sales growth to get to the lower end of our goal in margin expansion. And again, our margin expansion, Bob, is always guidance, excluding the impact of acquisition. So keep that in mind. I wouldn't focus completely on the restructuring. The goal is to get annual operating margin expansion. We have done that over a long history of time. We still believe that there's good opportunity, although there's balancing with entering into new markets, especially in the emerging markets, where today that's an investment. But overall, we still feel comfortable that operating margin expansion is a good opportunity for us, and we expect to achieve it, certainly, during this next 3-year strategic plan window.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Stanley, just to -- I know you commented on the North American Dental. The way I'm looking at equipment, I was wondering within the International business last quarter, clearly, there seemed to be a little more cautionary commentary in Europe around equipment. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more detail in the 4Q results on how the dental equipment shaped up in Europe? And then maybe just current thoughts on how you see that progressing in 2012.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. Well, Steve will give you specifics on the actual growth numbers internationally and shading on countries et cetera. But I think that the business is in pretty good shape. However, this is the one area in the portfolio I'm tending to be personally a little bit more cautious because if there is a tightening of credits or the stock markets don't do that well in Europe, that could make our customers a little bit negative. But I have to tell you, we're not seeing any significant swings yet. It's not as enthusiastic as it was, say, the day after the IDS meeting or the day of the IDS meeting but -- and so the data we're seeing is not that negative. But I think logic says that this is the one area we need to be a little bit cautious, and I think Steven has taken that into account as he's built his budgets.","S. Paladino","So just on equipment internationally, first, let me point out that when you look at the total international numbers, the equipment sales growth was only up slightly, a little less than 1%. But there's a story to that and the story is that, as Stanley said in his remarks, Australia and New Zealand had significant tax incentives in 2010, that people took advantage of to buy equipment. And excluding that, we did get -- I don't have the exact number, but low single-digit equipment sales growth on the equipment, on the international side. More broadly, when we look at our geographic split, we had during the quarter, very strong growth in the 3 large countries for us, namely, Germany, France and the U.K. Other countries also did well, including Australia and New Zealand on the consumables side. And of course, some of the Mediterranean countries are having a little bit of weakness. Italy is our biggest market there. So they're not having a stronger period. But overall, you know, I would say that internationally, right now, we're feeling like those markets also are modestly improving. Now be careful because if you're in a country where the improvement is -- the market declining less, that may be true for some of, again, the Mediterranean countries. But certainly, Germany, France and the U.K., we're getting good growth. The U.K. market is probably the softest of those big 3.  But we're gaining market share so we're doing well in that market. And again, the goal in our guidance is to have a conservative bias because there is a fair amount of uncertainty as to what's happening in Europe. We hope that, that conservative bias will turn out to be more conservative than what we built in, and we'll have some upside to that. But it's still early on in the year and we felt that it was not the time to be more optimistic at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steve, if I could maybe just follow up a little bit on the non-Dental business. Essentially, if I look at your Medical growth and the Vet growth, it certainly surprised me on the upside a little bit and I was wondering if you could discuss what happened in the Medical business a little bit more specifically, particularly, given there was a lack of seasonal flu this year. I'm kind of curious as to why the results were as strong as they were.","S. Paladino","Sure. And I think you're also asking about Animal Health so I'll comment on that, too. Medical -- we're clearly -- on both Medical and Animal Health, we're clearly gaining market share in both of those markets and by a pretty significant margin. Because if you look at Medical internal sales growth of slightly over 7%, the margin is probably just marginally positive. So most of that growth is market share gains. I think we're seeing growth in a couple of areas. One is in larger group practices that we're winning business in that area. This emerging -- it's more than emerging. This trend of practices that are either owned or affiliated on a group basis, either by IDNs or otherwise. So we're gaining share in that market, which is probably the fastest growing subsegment of the physician market and in other area, there are some pharmaceutical products, non-flu vaccine pharmaceutical products that we're capitalizing on, that we're doing well with. And as you probably know, we are a leader in the physician -- that niche physician pharma market. So we're benefiting probably more than our competition on some of those products because of that. So the Medical continues to be very solid.  Turning to Animal Health. Animal Health, this quarter, putting another extremely good quarter, also growing just slightly north of 7%. That's probably at least 2x what the market is growing in Animal Health. So that's very positive. I think, here, it's a continuation of -- we now have our Butler Schein team completely focused on driving market share gain. The integration is behind them. They're still -- their sales force is still learning all the new products, the new tools that they have as a part of the merger with Henry Schein business. And also there is a pharma product that's also aiding our growth as well as the market's. So that's just a little bit more color on both of those. We still think that, that is something that's continuing. We don't see weakness in either of those markets in the short term. Obviously, in the longer term, I would say, it's impossible to grow at 2x or 3x what the market is growing for the indefinite period of time.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, I guess, that was my question. I'm just kind of looking at sort of the market growth in your non-Dental businesses and non-Dental is now over 40% of the company by my estimate. Is it fair to say that this business is growing faster than Dental and is probably a little bit easier to take market share? Because I'm trying to put that in the context, Stan, of some of your comments regarding the company's internal goals if I look out 3 years, and I understand, you're not giving any guidance in the out years. But based on some of your internal goals, it appears you're looking to grow revenues compounded annually in that 5% to 6% growth range and as I think about it, with Dental kind of lagging behind that number, maybe it's the non-Dental businesses that kind of get you there. Is that a fair assessment or no?","Stanley M. Bergman","What I think you need to look at is our strategic goals. I think we spent a long time. We want to grow a couple of hundred basis points more than the market growth. We want to take our operating margin up by 25 to 50 basis points, somewhere around there. You do that and you end up with mid-term -- you end up with high single-digit EPS growth. Our goal is always to add a little bit through acquisitions and then you end up in the low teens. So I think -- what I'm thinking that's very, very important is to bear that in mind. When you look at the Animal Health numbers and you compare that to our competition and one has to be very careful. There are a couple of things here. First is the switching periodically both ways from agency to sales booked at the full rate of the sale. It does have margin implications but there's a difference between agency sale and regular sales, as when reports from a GAAP basis, so not the time in the call to go to the details. If you want it, please, anyone, feel free to give Steven or Susan or our guest relations people a call to get those details. But I think that has to be taken account. Then the swing between us and our competition on what happens in the large animal area has to be taken into account. So I think, overall, we expect to gain market share in the Animal Health arena. I think we're well positioned to do that. Our investments in the software area have paid off. I think there is lots of opportunity in the Medical arena as the market shifts from 1 and 2 and 3 practitioner offices to larger offices to multiple locations under common management. We've always done well in that area. If you look at the Dental space, I think the same dynamics apply. I think the consolidation in the Dental space, although not as rapid in the Medical, is moving in our favor. I think we've always had a big market share in that area. That part of the industry is spending money. So I would say in the North American area, we still believe we have lots of upside and certainly, although no one can guarantee, we're quite comfortable with growing at a couple of hundred basis points above the market growth. As it applies to international, I think Germany will do okay. France and Italy have somehow, even with challenged economies in the last decade or whatever, always tended to be okay. The U.K. is this year's challenge, I don't know if it's going to be next year's challenge but it's not material. The rest of Europe kind of balances itself out. You have Holland that does okay, always has, and you've got Spain that is a little bit -- has had some challenges, shall we say. But we're working off a lower base. The base really went down significant 3 years ago. And then, we have very good markets in Australia and New Zealand, and we had some issue there between the fourth quarter of 2010, being great the first quarter of 2011, not being so great second quarter of 2011. But it's not material overall. So if one looks through the portfolio, internationally, I think we will have okay growth in Europe, a little bit of some new business in the developing world and probably a turnaround in Australia and New Zealand. So I think the international world should also do okay and the 200 basis points or so more than the market, from an internal growth point of view, should be there. So overall, internal growth, I think it's well spread throughout the portfolio with my sense that on the acquisition side, barring perhaps something unusual happening on the positive side, shall we say, it's likely to be tilted towards international rather than the U.S. simply because the opportunities are there, although it's a greater extent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Cherny - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just thinking about some of your long-term strategic initiatives. Obviously, Stan, you brought up the idea of pursuing growth on a global scale. As you think about where you guys are strategically and it was obviously a much bigger move with Provet into the Australia and New Zealand markets last year. Are there any other geographies that you're particularly focused on in terms of building out, anywhere that you're not right now that you want to get into with the strength you've had in the Australia regions, that's somewhere you want to continue to grow? I'm just trying to get a sense of -- as you think about that long-term 3-year plan, when we get to 1\/1\/15, where does Henry Schein have a bigger presence from a geographic perspective?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, I'd like to be as specific as possible but obviously, for competitive reasons, it's probably not a good idea because when the word gets outs, the chance coming to market, that doesn't make any easier for us. And sometimes we just like to arrive. So having said that, I think Europe presents a market of the size of the U.S. and in the U.S, we have a significantly bigger market share than in Europe. So then Europe is there. I think the markets of Asia in the developing world and the aggregates are also equal to the U.S. and Europe. So if you break the world into 3 big markets of about equal size and I'm done converting [ph] it to the nearest dollar, you've got North America, you've got Europe and you've got Asia. And I don't -- I can't see a reason why we should not have similar market shares in Asia and the rest of the world, in Europe versus the U.S. and I still think there's upside in the U.S. So exactly how the mix works out is no one can tell because a lot of our acquisitions across all of them are opportunistic. But I think there's upside in the U.S. and there's opportunity in Europe and the rest of the world, the other 1\/3 to also grow. And there's a gap between our market shares in North America and our market shares in Europe and our market share in the rest of the world. So it's all over and lots and lots of opportunity over the next 3 years. But clearly, I think the globalization is critical for us as well as, by the way, expanding our footprint in business with specialists.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Michael R. Minchak - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. Just a couple of questions. First on the North American Dental equipment side. The growth in the fourth quarter bounced back after decline in the third quarter. Just wondering if you had a sense for how much of the fourth quarter growth do you think came from the end of your tax incentives. And maybe based on your sales pipeline, are you currently anticipating growth in that North American Dental equipment market in 2012?","Stanley M. Bergman","Sure. First, let me point out that our North American Dental equipment growth of 3.8%, I think, was the highest that we've achieved in 6 or 7 quarters. So yes, it was a little bit of tax pull-through. But I think that statement would still be true to a slightly less of extent without the tax incentives. So we do think that we saw an improvement in the Dental equipment market. Remember, a lot of this, Mike, is the sentiment in the dental office, dentists feel like the business -- the economies are doing well. Patient traffic is steady and maybe modestly improving. So that allows them to make some investments in their own practice. We think that we'll see growth in the market and we'll take market share in equipment in 2012 in the dental market. That's our goal. I'll remind you also that the negative sales impact related to [indiscernible] is now over. So that's annualized. So we had a little bit of that negative impact in Q4 so our growth was probably a little bit higher than that, maybe another 1\/2 a point or so. So that's now gone. So that will help also into 2012. So we feel again, like the Dental equipment market is beginning to improve and come back. I just want to be careful because it's really hard for us to estimate exactly how much of that improvement in Q4 is related to tax incentives. I think, again, though just to conclude, we still would have had the best quarter in 6 quarters on equipment, even if the tax incentives were not as significant.","Michael R. Minchak - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood and then maybe just a quick housekeeping question. Are you assuming any additional share buybacks in your 2012 guidance?","Stanley M. Bergman","No. There's maybe a small modest amount from what we've already completed in Q1 that's baked in. But really, there's not -- acquisitions and stock buyback are based on when we do that so it's really not baked into any significant expense in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So it seems like you guys have a pretty good momentum here exiting 2011. I'm just kind of curious -- just general comments on leaving the 2012 EPS guidance unchanged, if that's just being conservative. And I only ask because -- this is probably semantics but it just seems like the same EPS range you now suggest, basically about 6% to 8% growth, instead of 8% to 10% previously when you factor in ending 2011 on a higher EPS base and also the additional Butler JV accretion. But just sort of the general thoughts around the 2012 guidance.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. The overall growth is 7% to 9%. I guess there's a few comments. One, just remember, everyone, that 2012 is one less selling week than 2011. That probably has at least a 1% negative impact on EPS, maybe slightly more than that, maybe as much as 1.5%. So that's just a fact. We can't do anything about that. The second point is the goal was to put out guidance with a little bit of a conservative bias. We do think that the global economies, while they're improving and our markets seem to be improving, the sustainability of that still has some uncertainty. And we've decided that, especially given what's going on in Europe, that it was more prudent to be conservative in the outlook. We're hoping that -- we're maybe being a little bit too conservative but time will tell. And maybe the last thing that I would point to is when you look at foreign exchange rates, when we -- while on the call, when we initially gave guidance, the dollar to the euro was either $1.36 or $1.37. Today, it's slightly north of $1.30. So that has a negative impact on translating EPS growth. We still -- that's not negatively impacting our guidance because we were conservative on what we've used in foreign exchange rate. But obviously, now that conservatism is less because of the way the dollar has strengthened. And quite frankly, I don't think anyone really can predict with any degree of certainty what's going to happen, although I personally think that there's a greater likelihood that the euro will weaken a little further. But we'll see what happens. There's a little bit of conservatism built into what's going on with foreign exchange rate. And those are maybe the 3 things I'd point to and maybe less -- still early in the year. It's only mid-February now, right? It's still a long way to go for the year to go.","S. Paladino","And having said that, I must say we are feeling very comfortable with our business. But this is not the time to be adjusting guidance. Let's have another quarter or so under our belt and -- but the business is feeling pretty good right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Stanley, I was hoping I could push you a little bit just on your strategic, your 3-year plan as you talk about getting to that $10 billion, obviously, a big goal there. But when you look at the numbers, it's maybe about 5% to 6% compounded annual growth over the next few years and you yourself started talking through kind of what your -- historically your company-wide plan has been, which is 4% to 5% or maybe 5%, 6% market, shying a couple of points above that and then acquisitions on top of that. So where you typically talked about maybe mid to upper single-digit company-wide growth, you're putting out a 3-year plan of 5% to 6%. How do I just reconcile those 2?","Stanley M. Bergman","Maybe I didn't use the right word. It's over $10 billion. And I hope our team is listening in to the call because that's the hope and the aspiration. I think the aspiration, obviously, has to be a little bit ahead of our commitments to the street. But overall, this should be a company, January 1, 2015, well over $10 billion","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So we shouldn't read that at all to mean that maybe Schein's ability to outperform the markets by 100 or 200 basis points, you're coming off that or that you're coming off kind of your acquisition -- expectations of maybe a few hundred points annualized a year over the longer term?","Stanley M. Bergman","Not at all. Not at all. I think if $11 billion or so were a round number, the number may have been $11 billion. $10 billion sounds like a nice aspiration and it's got to be over that or north. We give an exact time, we're not saying it's going to happen on January 1. Hopefully, a little bit earlier.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And Steve, could you just a little color maybe on basic equipment versus high-tech equipment in the quarter. And then the follow-up there, just on the basic equipment side, I think you guys are making some push or making a push on kind of the office planning side and some courses you're running this year or planning to run this year. Can you just talk about maybe how you think high-tech versus basic dental equipment plays out this year?","S. Paladino","Sure. I think the good news is while high-tech continues to be the fastest subcategory within our overall Dental equipment growth, we had very, very good growth in traditional equipment also, not as good. Of course, again, high-tech was the fastest growing but traditional equipment is growing and helped contribute to that overall almost 4% growth. So it was really across the board and going forward, we do expect to -- I still think high-tech equipment will continue to outperform traditional equipment in the next year or 2 or longer, simply because higher return on investment for our customer base, as well as still relatively modest market penetration. As you know, the traditional equipment is a combination mostly of replacement market, as well as, as new offices open or people move to a new office, many times they'll re-equip their office. But it's primarily a replacement market whereas digital x-ray, CAD\/CAM, intra-oral cameras and other high-tech equipment still is growing in demand and market penetration for our customers. So we think that will continue for at least the next few years.","Operator","And we now have time for one last question. That will come from the line of Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick clarifications. First, Steve, on the segment reporting, just to confirm, you're going to be giving us 8 segments now versus 6 starting in March. Is that right?","S. Paladino","No, no. Let me clarify because that's not correct. We have today -- we show effectively 2 segments, right? We have healthcare distribution and technology. And then we have subcomponents within healthcare distribution. So the first thing is that technology will stay the same. No changes there. So there's going to be core technology as a separate segment. The change is occurring within the healthcare distribution segments. Other than showing what we currently show, which is Dental, Medical, Vet for North America individually and then International, the subsectors there will be Global Dental, Global Medical, Global Vet and International will effectively go away. So it's going 3 subsegments within healthcare distribution rather than before. So again -- so I just want to clarify and I'm glad you asked that. And then what we'll do, we'll probably continue to give some color information on geographically, North American sales growth within Dental, Europe and maybe rest of world something like that, although we haven't completely determined that. The other thing I wanted to point out, Larry, is what we plan on doing is providing a data book on historical information in this format. The goal is to post something on our website for investors during the third quarter, within the next probably 4 weeks or so, so that investors and analysts can see the historical reporting, see the growth rates and begin thinking about that in preparation for our Q1 results.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, okay. So you're going to try to be -- you have some clarification on components but you're not specifically going to give us any more North American equipment -- North American Dental equipment, North American Dental consumables.","S. Paladino","I think we probably will continue to do that at least during the transitional period because we want to try to be very transparent with our investor group, and we recognize that people have looked at this for many years in the way that we've historically presented it and we don't want people to lose their data points.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, good. Okay, that makes sense. Implicitly, you already gave us International, Vet, Medical and Dental through your percentage numbers but it will be helpful to see that. I guess then and just a clarification about your strategic initiative internationally. You mentioned the $11 million to $13 million. So once you get through 2012, that should be a profit generator for you. So can you elaborate with 3 teams now versus 1, why that will be the cost saver? And are you in a position to say -- in ballpark numbers, what kind of cost savings you can get out of that, say, starting in 2013?","S. Paladino","I hesitate a little bit but it has a slightly greater than a 1:1 payback once fully implemented. So that's -- I'd rather leave it at that. It will be a little bit greater than that but not significantly. And again, it really depends on once implemented and executed.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And finally, so what usage do you think -- even though it's 3 teams now versus 1, it's actually being more streamlined, more efficient than what you have now. Is that what you're saying?","S. Paladino","I'm not sure I understand why you say 3 teams.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","We're using global. Oh, I see. I guess you're saying global. International is going to report up to a global head so I see, so you're really taking out some of the senior officers.","Stanley M. Bergman","No, no, no. I think some of these are apples and oranges. The first thing is, we have been organized along geographic lines from an internal point of view up to now. We had a North American Dental and Medical business. We had an International business and we had a business that was U.S. Animal Health and some Dental businesses. What we are doing is returning the business into, from an organizational point of view over the next 6 months or so, into 3 global verticals, one a global Dental business. And we issued announcement internally on the services being dealt with from an internal point of view, an international Animal Health business and a international Medical business. So there will be 3 global verticals. The management has been arranged -- rearranged to focus instead of on a geographical basis and within that geographical basis by profession. We are going to focus globally by profession because we think that there's a lot in common between the professional aspirations and the needs of the practitioner on a global basis, and we want to leverage the economies of competency. So it's not adding any additional management per se as a result of its reorganization or any additional costs. What we are doing independent of this, we are reducing expenditure in certain parts of the business, which is dealing essentially the reorganization and increasing expenditures to bring on expertise in new areas that we think are very important to drive our strategic plan.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's clear now. And then finally, just a quick clarification on Medical. You may not quantify this much but I think you'd said, hey, we're gaining market share based on strong management positioning clearly the physician to practices associated with IDN and IDN is going faster than your overall business, which is growing 7%, which is great. Can you clarify, if you could, how fast is that piece of Medical growing, the IDN piece? And then just remind us when you mentioned strong management, the top 2 or 3 managers in that business that you highlight.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. So on the Medical side, IDN is part of it but it's really the newer entities that are emerging, which is entities that roughly correspond to multiple locations under common management or many more practitioners in one setting. And that, of course, includes IDNs in one way or another but not by any means exclusively IDN. So that part of the business is managed by our global services group, which we put into effect. We created that group 3 years ago and I think we spoke at the time about a strategic plan we just completed for our Medical area, which contemplated a view of 2 things. One is greater specialization and organization of the business by specialty to a greater extent and then the focusing on the global services group, which is these newer entities that have emerged. But when it comes to healthcare services, global services is different and healthcare services, which focuses on these newer entities. So there are 2 plays that have gone on our Medical world. One is a focus on specialty and the other is a focus on these newer entities through our healthcare services group. And that, I think, has driven quite a bit of our sales. Now you ask who's managing the group. Well, the group today is part of our North American group and that reports up to Jim Breslawski and the person -- the senior executive running our medical group is Dave McKinley, who joined the company, I would say, about 6 years ago. And he and his team drive our North American Medical group. There is also a small group in Europe but it's not material on the International Medical side. I'll take you through underneath that core spread, connect, take you up the sales side and so on and so forth.","S. Paladino","Yes. I'll just conclude because we're running a little late on time. But I'll just conclude. Now I don't want to be very specific on how fast that subsegment is growing but I will say, it's growing significantly faster and it's in the double-digit range. But I'd rather leave it at that for now. And just in the interest of time, I think Stanley is just going to wrap up at this time. We're running a little over.","Stanley M. Bergman","Right. These are good questions, and of course, please, everyone, feel free to give Steve a call at (621) 843-5912 or Susan Vassallo at the same with a 5564 -- 62. I don't call Susan that often. She has an office near me, 5562. And so please feel free to reach out to them. ","Again, I think, you can sense from the prepared remarks and the Q&A, we remain very bullish about our business. We think we're in the right space. We think that preventative care is going to continue to drive our -- and a desire for preventative care is going to continue to drive our Dental business. The movement towards more primary care is also important in our Medical business, plus our focus on specialty in the dental world and in the medical world is helping us. Our global view of things, I think, is the right strategy for us at this time. And as I've said before, there's no need for us to leave this terrific marketplace of the office-based practitioner, lots and lots of value-added service business to go, software opportunities all over the place and we're very, very happy with the strategic plan we have, with our senior management team, with the entire motivation level of the company. And I've just visited our European businesses, Australia and New Zealand business, and I can report to shareholders that we really are -- have a company with high morale and excitement. So we look forward to speaking to you. I think it's in -- this time, it's 8 weeks' time and when we will be reporting on our first quarter numbers. So thank you, thank you and bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes the Henry Schein Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you Holly. Before I begin, I want to make sure that we no longer have that background noise. It sounds like it is now muted. Thank you. Thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2019 third quarter. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referenced to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end-market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.","Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.","These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for information and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the supplemental info section of our Investor Relations website and in Exhibit B of today's press release which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 5, 2019.

Please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up during Q&A to allow as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour we have allotted for this call.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you Carolynne. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. We are pleased that we reported solid third quarter financial results with increases in diluted EPS from continuing operations of 54.2% on a GAAP basis and 15.4% on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to make progress in growing organically with a focus on sales of higher-margin products while making strategic investments to supplement growth in the years ahead. Today, we are tightening our guidance range for 2019 non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations, which reflects growth of 8% to 9% compared to 2018 results.","Steven will discuss this in greater detail in a moment but note that we continue to believe that global dental and medical markets that we serve are growing. We are executing well on our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan, especially in the slow-growing U.S. dental consumable market. As we progress with our strategic plan, we are confident that we are well positioned to gain further market share in all our businesses, leading to increased EPS. We are particularly pleased this quarter with the performance in our international businesses as well as our dental specialties, technology and value-added services and U.S. medical businesses.","As you listen to our call today and of course read our filings, I hope that our investors appreciate that we are making solid progress in driving the composition of our operating margin towards higher margin products, including our specialty brands, suppliers who value the services we provide and of course efficiencies in the business. While we are investing heavily in additional value-added services and digital signal technology, both in our distribution, manufacturing and Henry Schein One businesses as well as human capital, our number one assets and of course continue to advance satisfying and in fact, exceeding the needs of our customers in environments where all businesses are faced with increased expectations by customers.","So I hope that I believe we provided the information needed for our investors to come to the conclusion that I just outlined. So at this time, I will hand the call over to Steven to review our financial results and guidance and then I will provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments as well as a number of other matters. Thank you. Steven?","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you Stanley and good morning to all. As we begin, I would like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis.","Our Q3 2019 and Q3 2018 non-GAAP results exclude certain costs that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website. Please note that as with the first half of the year, we have again included a corporate sales category for Q3 that represents sales to Covetrus under the transition services agreement. There product related TSAs are currently scheduled to run through August 2020.","It should also be noted that in October 2019, we sold our minority equity interest in Hu-Friedy, a manufacturer of dental instruments and infection prevention solutions. This minority investment sale will result in a significant fourth quarter gain in 2019. However, at this time, we are still quantifying the exact amount of the gain due to certain contingent consideration included in the transaction. I will also note that this investment was a non-controlling investment and we were not involved in running the business. We also had no representation on the company's Board of Directors. This was a financial investment. We have had an excellent relationship over many years with Hu-Friedy as one of their key distribute distribution partners, in particular helping them build share in the international markets.","So now turning to our Q3 results. Net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 28, 2019, were $2.5 billion, reflecting a 6.5% increase compared with the third quarter of 2018, with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 3.9%. When excluding the sales to Covetrus under the TSA, internal sales growth in local currencies was 3.0%. The details of our sales growth are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings press release that was issued earlier this morning.","On a GAAP basis, operating margin for the third quarter of 2019 was 7.5% and increased 223 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring costs in both periods and also excludes the litigation settlement expense in the prior year, our operating margin was 7.4% and increased 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis, mainly due to lower expenses as a percentage of sales. Of that 20 basis point increase in operating margin, acquisitions contributed 12 basis points. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin in the supplemental info page on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Turning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 23.5%. This compares with 15.7% GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018. However, on non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 23% and 0.5% and this compares with the prior year non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.5% in the same period last year. Again, look at the supplemental info page on the Investor Relations page of our website for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP taxes. We estimate that our full year effective tax rate will be in the 24% range, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.","Moving on, net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for Q3 of 2019 was $134.9 million or $0.91 per diluted share. And this compares with the prior-year GAAP net income from continuing operations of $90.8 million or $0.59 per share. Third quarter 2019 results include a pretax reduction in the estimated restructuring cost that we previously have accrued of about $800,000 or $0.01 per diluted share. Again, those restructuring cost were originally accrued in earlier period and this was a small change in estimate for those costs. Excluding the reduction in restructuring cost, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2019 was $134.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share and this compares with non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $120 million or $0.78 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018. This represents growth of 12% and 15.4%, respectively.","If we are looking at provide some additional detail on our results from continuing operations, it's important to note that amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q3 2019 was $29.5 million pretax or $0.15 per diluted share. This compares with $19 million pretax or $0.09 per diluted share for the same period last year. For the first nine months of the year, the amortization was $79.6 million pretax or $0.40 per diluted share and that compares to the nine months of $56.2 million pretax or $0.20 per diluted share in the same period last year. I will also note, in Q3 of this year, foreign exchange currency negatively impacted our diluted EPS by approximately 1% for the quarter.","Let me now provide some detail on the sales results for the quarter. Our dental sales were $1.5 billion, an increase of 2.1% compared with the prior year with internal growth in local currencies of 1.7%. North American internal sales in local currencies was down 0.2% and included 1.2% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales of dental specialty products and is also against a difficult comparison in the prior year as internal sales growth for dental consumables last year was 4.3%.","Our dental equipment sales and service revenues included internal sales that decreased 4.5% in local currencies. That's partially related to deferral of sales orders in anticipation of the Dentsply Sirona World sales event which was held in October this year and was held in Q3 last year. That contributed to a decline in high-tech equipment sales. This decline was mostly driven by lower CAD\/CAM sales because of that selling event. I will also note that our current dental equipment backlog is very solid.","International dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 5.0%. This included 4.1% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. Our growth in international consumable merchandise sales was driven by broad-based sales growth across Europe and other international markets, including strong dental specialty sales in our international markets. The international dental equipment sales and service revenue internal growth in local currencies was 7.9%, including very strong CAD\/CAM sales. Note that our change in our business model in Brazil had very little impact on the international dental equipment sales in the current quarter.","Medical sales were $804 million in the third quarter, an increase of 11.3% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 5.3%. The 5.3% internal growth in local currencies was the same number in both North America and internationally. Our medical sales results once again are driven by both solid organic growth along with a contribution of acquisitions sales growth from North American Rescue acquisition. We believe our medical group is well-positioned with large group practices, independent physician offices and alternate sites of care with strong customer relationships in each category contributing to our growth.","Our technology and value-added services sales from continuing operations were $137 million in the third quarter, an increase of 15.1% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 4.9%. In North America, technology internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.5% on an as reported basis. Our technology sales in Q3 2019 were bolstered by a billing related to the U.S. Department of Defense contract which was approximately $9 million in the current quarter and that compares to $6.3 million in the same period last year. This was partially offset by lower financial services revenue related to the lower dental equipment sales we experienced in the third quarter. Internationally, technology and value-added services internal sales growth increased by 7.35% in local currencies.","We continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the third quarter buying 1.6 million shares at an average price of $62.48 for a total of approximately $98 million. The impact of the repurchase of shares on our third quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. Also note, on October 31, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of shares and that's on top of the $75 million that we have available at the end of the quarter. So in total, we have $475 million available for future stock repurchases.","Let's take a brief look at some of the highlights of our cash flow. We had strong operating cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter. It was $226.4 million and that compared to $157.5 million in the third quarter of last year. We continue to believe we will have strong operating cash flow for the year. We also note that we plan on implementing a new restructuring initiative in 2020. The goal of that initiative is two-fold. One is to help mitigate stranded cost from some of the expiring transitional services agreements related to the Animal Health Spin-off as well as to continue to look for more opportunities to save costs and drive operating efficiencies. At this time, we do not have specific details on this initiative since they are in process of being developed but we will provide additional details on future earnings calls.","I will conclude my remarks by noting that we are tightening our guidance range for 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS. At this time, we are not providing GAAP guidance as we are unable to provide an accurate estimate of the gain on the minority equity investment tat we just talked about that. That will be recorded in the fourth quarter. Again, this gain is subject to certain contingent consideration related to the transaction, which makes calculating it a little bit more difficult. This guidance supersedes both our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance previously issued.","Our 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. is now expected to be in the range of $3.41 to $3.47, reflecting growth of 8% to 9% compared with the 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations which was $3.17. The outlook for 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations excludes $0.08 of estimated restructuring expenses and $0.01 credit to income tax expense related to the Animal Health Spin-off. Non-GAAP guidance also excludes the gain on sales of minority equity investment which will be recorded in Q4 and also our non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations for 2018 exclude certain expenses and benefits, netting to a charge of $0.37 per diluted share and you could see that as reflected on our previous earnings releases for 2018.","Turning to 2020. We are introducing non-GAAP diluted EPS for 2020. At this time, again, we will not be providing GAAP diluted EPS as we are unable to provide an accurate estimate of costs related to the restructuring that I mentioned earlier. 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 and that reflects growth of 6% to 9% compared with the midpoint of our 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was $3.44.","Our guidance for both 2019 and 2020 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. is for current operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions, if any, or the restructuring expenses. Guidance assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. And the guidance also assumes that end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions.","I will also note that our guidance assumes certain continued IT investment in three areas. One is CRM. The second is European ERP. And the third is our web interface development. We will continue to make investments in those three areas in 2020.","With that said, I would like to now turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you Steven. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter dental business highlights. During the quarter, the North American dental consumable merchandise internal sales grew by 1.2% in local currencies as we reported earlier on. As Steven mentioned, this despite a difficult comparison to the third quarter last year when we reported growth of more than 4%. In the third quarter, we believe Henry Schein grew slightly faster than the end markets.","Internationally, dental consumables internal sales in local currencies grew 4.1%. This was also faster than our estimates for the end market growth driven by broad-based sales across the entire business, in part driven by strong dental specialty sales as well. And the third quarter internal sales of global dental specialty products increased 9.3% in local currencies and we did particularly well in the areas of implants and bone regeneration products and endodontic products of our own brands.","In dental equipment, internal sales in the third quarter in North America declined 4.5% in local currencies, primarily related to decline in high-tech equipment revenue. Traditional equipment sales grew at a healthy rate of 4.8%. We are particularly pleased with our performance on the equipment sales in general.","As you may know, one of our large dental manufacturing partners, Dentsply Sirona, there was a key sales event early in the fourth quarter and we believe a portion of practices in the U.S. held off on equipment purchases in anticipation of show promotions. Last year, this event was in the third quarter of 2018. This was an excellent sales event for Henry Schein, particularly for sales of high tech equipment and specifically CAD\/CAM and extraoral imaging products.","More than twice as many of our dental customers attended the Dentsply Sirona World compared to last year and we believe the strong participation should translate into incremental dental equipment sales for Henry Schein in the fourth quarter and beyond that even. As Steven mentioned, our current dental equipment backlog suggests improved fourth quarter dental equipment sales.","International dental equipment internal sales had a robust growth of 8% in local currencies in the third quarter. This was particularly encouraging given the economies in certain of the markets that we operate showing that dentists are prepared to invest in their practices when the investment results in improved profitability of the practice, while at the same time providing better quality care for the patients that the practitioner is treating. We know that investing in new dental equipment and digital technology can transform a dental practice through enhanced capabilities, greater efficiency and increased patient satisfaction. We look forward to working with strategic supplier partners to build mutual market share for those manufacturers who continue to innovate and address practice opportunities and challenges and who understand and appreciate the value that Henry Schein can bring to those manufacturers who are bringing their products to market.","We continue to see opportunities to advance interoperability between Henry Schein One and equipment manufactures. This is really important. A key part of the strategy of Henry Schein One is to integrate specifically digital dental equipment into the electronic medical record and from there also advance better quality of care and patient demand generation. Over time, we believe that key demographic trends including among the aging population in the developed world and expanding middle class in the developing world as well as greater awareness of the link between oral care and oral health will all drive dental market growth. And specifically with certain products and specifically in the specialty products and digital dentistry.","We have built our portfolio of solutions around helping dental professionals manage more efficient practices, enabling our customers to improve the overall health and well-being of their patients, help to educate patients about the oral systemic connection. The connection between good oral care and good health care in general. There is a huge amount of data that has been published in the last decade specifically in the last few years connecting the notion of good oral care with good health care in general.","We believe education will invigorate the dental practice with new wellness services and reinforce the value of prevention and regular oral care as with general population understands that wellness and prevention lead to a better life, a quality of life, and, of course, lower cost of healthcare in general. The requirements have moved from sick care to health care, which is a good segue into our medical business, which is focused in the ultimate care section of medicine with a high focus on wellness and prevention.","We delivered solid internal growth in the third quarter of 5.3% in local currencies. Our medical team has built a reputation for excellence in serving small and large scale physician practices with a goal of enhancing patient care. We have made many investments in our solutions and systems to optimize what oftentimes are highly complicated supply chain systems. The needs of the office-based practitioner of the ultimate care sites are quite unique and we believe we satisfy these customers in a rather unique way.","Our goal is to think ahead of an evolving medical landscape to best support patient focus care across the sub-acute spectrum. And in this connection, we continue to invest in technology to support these customers' unique needs. A great example of our forward thinking is our announcement several months ago of the availability of Medpod MobileDoc 2, integrated with Uber Health. This platform is designed to enable health care practitioners to conduct remote telemedicine examinations for patients in nontraditional care settings, such as homes, offices and schools.","We provide the vital signs monitoring equipment in the vehicle so that the practitioner is able to read and gauge the vital signs of the patients in the field. We are helping to seek practices transform and improve relationships with patients looking for convenient access to care, a key requirement of the younger generation. As we invest in our teams, systems and product offerings, we believe we will remain a trusted valued partner to small physician practices, large group medical practice, specialties practices, general practices and urgent care and ambulatory care centers as they promote increased wellness and prevention for their patients while at the same time servicing the ambulatory surgical center in a rather unique way.","Now let's move to our technology and value-added services business. Henry Schein continues to evolve as a provider, as a service provider shall we say, as well as a resource for unmatched selection of products and services. Henry Schein One is an important strategic asset, not only in the day-to-day management of practices, but also to drive both existing and prospective patients into our customer's practices. Over the years, we have successfully expanded our services beyond our world-class distribution platform and practice management software into building a model to help practitioners better engage with and market their practices to patients and serve these practices more efficiently and effectively. In other words, positioning our customers to provide better healthcare, providing better tools to provide better healthcare while bringing that to the attention of the public and their patients in general.","The Henry Schein One platform exemplifies our service-oriented solutions and last quarter, we delivered several new functional enhancements. In practice management, we introduced electronic forms of consents as well as new practice workflow tools. In patient engagement and patient acquisitions, we launched an expressed chick-in solution as well as a powerful new full appointment to allow practices book open appointment slots to help dentists manage practices and maintain a full schedule and prioritize the procedures in conformity with the practitioners' needs. We also offer online appointment booking through Dentrix Ascend. This is our successful cloud-based system and soon through Dentrix, our traditional Windows-based system, allowing patients to book appointments on their practice website as well as through links in emails and text appointment reminders. We have a significant text reminder business around the world and actually quite uniquely in our international markets.","I mentioned last quarter that we are looking for new opportunities to cross sell our software solutions with practitioners who purchase our consumable merchandise and equipment. Our Henry Schein One and Henry Schein dental teams are increasingly engaged and working collaboratively to support our customers across our business. Although it's barely a year old, we continue to believe that Henry Schein One represents a significant opportunity over the short, medium and long term and we expect to continue to enhance our product offering.","Before we open the call to questions, I would like to comment on two important developments related to litigation. First, with regard to the recent decision by the FTC, we are gratified that the Chief Administrative Law Judge dismissed claims that Henry Schein conspired with competitors to avoid providing discounts to buying groups representing dental practitioners which we publicly denied from the start and are happy to do business with dentists in any form, have been committed to doing that for decades.","Secondly, we announced that in the case of opioid litigation involving Summit County, Ohio, presently before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, the plaintiff has agreed to dismiss Henry Schein with prejudice as a defendant. The opioid crisis is a terrible national tragedy and we believe that all segments of society must come together to address this crisis. Even before this litigation, we have played a constructive role and look forward to continue to play a constructive role in helping to advance solutions that put an end to the tragic opioid addiction crisis.","As such, Henry Schein will make $1 million donation to establish an educational foundation in Summit County to develop best practices regarding the proper use of prescription opioids. We believe this will in the end be a benefit to practitioners in dental and medical and society in general. Working with Summit County, we will make the donation to a Pain Management Education Foundation dedicated to making grants supporting and aggregating research around best practices for pain management, including the prescription of opioids and alternatives, educating dentists, physicians, clinical associates, patients and patient networks on those best practices along with the risks of opioid addictions and alternative pain management treatment, opioid options for key indications.","Henry Schein will also pay $250,000 of Summit County expenses. Henry Schein has a long-standing commitment to doing well by doing good and operating our business in an ethical manner wherever we might operate throughout the world. Team Schein looks forward to continuing to serve all our customers and suppliers with excellence and integrity that is expected from us and at the same time serving the needs of our investors and indeed society in general.","With that, operator, we look forward to opening the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Glen Santangelo, Guggenheim.","Glen Santangelo","Hi. Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to comment on underlying market growth rate trends in the North American dental business. It looks this quarter that the consumable business obviously was facing a difficult 4%-plus comp last year and the equipment business was obviously impacted by the timing of the Dentsply event. But as we look to the balance of the year, have you seen any change in those underlying trends in either of those two businesses? And where would you sort of peg the growth rates at for each?","Stanley Bergman","Yes. Glen, I think it's hard to be precise within basis points. I mean they are in a very narrow trading range. But if you kind of look at on the consumable side, what we did in 2018, what we did in 2019, you divide by two, it's something like that. Maybe a little lower, maybe a little higher but it's some deflation, not a lot. The unit growth is about stable in general, quite well with pretty good growth in the specialty areas and the number of procedures. So on balance, it's very hard to be precise.","On equipment, the market is quite healthy and we often caution investors not to look at one or two quarters but to take a look at a 12-month, four quarter, something like that. This quarter was a particularly unusual quarter. We actually had very good traditional equipment sales. One or two vendors did well. One or two vendors were somewhat challenged. We had some challenges with the CAD\/CAM and the extraoral imaging products. But in that regard, a lot of that is related to a particular supplier, Dentsply who held a convention in the third quarter and we have reported that we have a pretty solid backlog of equipment going into the fourth quarter.","So I think it's very, very hard to be precise within basis points. But generally, I think these markets are positive with equipment being quite good. I am not saying we were surprised with the positive developments on the traditional equipment side, but I think that's an indication that practitioners are prepared to invest in their practice and by the way, this is not only in the United States but in Europe also. With the surprisingly challenging economy in most of our major markets, we have done quite well. And I think we did pick up market share. But the bottom line is practitioners are investing in their practices.","Glen Santangelo","I appreciate the comments, Stan. Steve, maybe if I could just follow-up on the initial fiscal 2020 guide. I was kind of just curious, are you assuming any trend changes in any of those underlying markets? I know you specifically did not include any capital deployment in your guidance and you sort of called out the IT investments. I just wonder if you could maybe size that? And any sort of high level commentary to help us think about that initial guidance would be helpful. Thanks.","Steven Paladino","Sure. So the 2020 guidance assumes that market conditions are pretty much consistent with what we are currently experiencing. So we are still expecting U.S. consumable merchandise growth to be modest. We are expecting a little bit of pickup on overall equipment. Again, we think Q3 was negatively impacted by, again, the Dentsply Sirona World sales event. But we do have a little bit of headwinds in a couple of areas.","One is in stranded costs. Stranded cost in 2020 are expected to be greater than 2019. Right now, we are estimating that they could be at the high-end of the range, could be $10 million to $12 million. But we are working very diligently on reducing those stranded costs. But there is still more work to be done to see how far we can reduce them. But again, right now, the estimate is in the $10 million to $12 million range.","And there were also increased investments in the technology investments. We are not quantifying exactly how much that is, but certainly it's in the millions of dollars range of increased IT investments. Part of that is going to be ongoing because some of those IT investments are not a one-year event. They are multiple year events. So I think the step-up is in 2020. And hopefully they won't as significant a step-up in future years.","We also assume from the effective tax rate, that the tax rate will be approximately equal to or slightly less than what we currently are experiencing. So at the 24% range or slightly below 24%. And we are assuming a little bit, not the full amount, a little bit of stock buyback in our guidance. We are not assuming the full amount that was authorized since it's difficult to predict exactly how much we will buyback in any given year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jon Block, Stifel.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Nice quarter. I am actually going to start with the specialty consumable number. Stan, I thought you gave a number around 9% or even over 9%. That's a big number. So was that predominantly or all driven by implants? Are there any incremental revenues coming from some of your other initiatives like I guess what I am alluding to would be clear aligners and do you that high single digit number from specialty can be maintained as we look forward?","Stanley Bergman","Thanks. Jon, that's a very good question. I think we have outlined to Wall Street on many occasions that our goal is, of course, to continue to make our distribution business a core business more efficient, continue to grow market share, satisfy the complexities of our customers, they are growing, some of them, even the small customers have great demand today for our value-added services. But we have two key programs, well three key initiatives to mitigate margin compression.","The first is specialty products. I will cover that in a minute. The second is value-added services. And the third is expense mitigation, in other words, driving efficiency in the practice business. A slight bonus in that, a challenge in that, because we had the Covetrus -- sorry.","Steven Paladino","TSA sales.","Stanley Bergman","TSA sales and the stranded costs that we have to deal with. But now if you go into specialty businesses, we have a relatively small market share. And what we have shown to be successful is to combine the specialty products, the niche products with the general merchandise and equipment we sell and bundle that with the practice management software where we have leading positions in several of the specialty areas. So yes, we believe we can continue to grow our specialty product businesses in the niche products as well as the general consumables and equipment and software.","Returning to the niche products. We believe we have a small market share, relatively small market share, in implants and bone regeneration. Yet, these are important positions. We have great platform. We have very good know-how. We have excellent facilities. The management is really superb. And we believe we can continue. Now I cannot guarantee. Of course, no one can that we will have double digit growth in implants and bone regeneration products going forward.","And at the same time, I think we have a relatively small position in the worldwide endodontic market. We certainly work with certain branded manufacturers and hope to continue to do that. But we also have our own brand products that are doing quite well and have also returned somewhere around double digit growth. Orthodontics is a bit more challenging, shall we say. We have a very small business in wires and brackets. I think there is an opportunity there. We have some unique products and we are doing well with the unique products. That market is not growing significantly, although it's probably somewhere between stable and a slight decrease.","On the aligner side, I think we have a good product. We have had a soft launch. I think the product actually works and is pretty good. I wouldn't want to make claims on this call but I am told by our KOLs that it's a very good product. And we are sharpening the related software for those areas to support the aligner, the various kinds of software to support the aligner and really believe we have a very good solution for the GPs in particular because there is actually no reason to go to a direct to consumer company if you can get a great product, a really outstanding product provided by clinician at a slightly higher price, not much higher.","So we believe we will do well eventually over time with the GPs and I believe the specialists are starting to appreciate our offering, which is a little bit different to any of the market offerings out there. And we are not really looking to be a generic compared to anyone out there. We are looking to create our own demand for our own products in the specialty area.","So yes, we do remain quite optimistic about the specialties areas and who knows exactly. It's not possible to predict. But we believe that a greater part of Henry Schein's profits over the next few years, at least the next three, four, five, seven years will come from these specialty products under our brand as well as working with certain branded manufacturers who are increasing their demand, their sales of certain specialty products.","Jon Block","Great. Fantastic color. Thanks for that. And with the second question, I will just pivot over to the medical business. The 5% change in total was still well above industry. But the two-year stack was about 10%, the past tow years in 2017 and 2018, the two years stacks were a lot closer to midteens. So should we just think about the rate of your market share gain is starting to diminish a bit? And maybe that mid single digit plus type of number for medical is the better neighborhood to be in? Thanks for your time, guys.","Stanley Bergman","Yes. Glen, I think we have mentioned this before with respect to medical. You can't judge one particular quarter. First, I think we will continue to invest in additional businesses in the medical field to expand our offering. So that will bring us acquisition growth, but that offering will also bring us internal growth. NAR, for example, is a very nice product offering. We have got acquisition growth but it will result in internal growth.","One also has to be careful in looking at any one quarter. There are so many variables. You take flu, for example. One year, there is a demand for flu test. The other year there is not. One year, a flu vaccine is delivered in the third quarter. One year, it's delivered in the fourth quarter. So I think what's important here is to look at our business over a three, four quarter basis and again, we don't have a crystal ball but we are pretty comfortable that we are positioned to deal with the service, the transfer of procedures from the acute care setting to the office-based or the surgery center environments or even the urgent center environment and to gain further market share in that area.","And those are reasonably fast growing markets and we are quite comfortable in that. We have got a really outstanding management team there too. They are investing in software, unique software for those markets. And so with the acquisitions, we will expect to have greater internal growth, acquisition growth and continue to gain market share in a he market that is growing. So it's hard to gauge one quarter at a time and hard to talk about whether it is going to be double digit growth or not, but it is going to be a decent market growth and sales growth and will continue to add to our profitability in combination with all the other strategies we just outlined.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson, Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning guys. Stanley, I want to follow up on a comment you made earlier about the dental equipment business and looking at it over more than a single quarter. If I look over the last 12 months, it seems like your North American dental equipment revenue is kind of flat, maybe even down a little bit from the 12 month period prior to that. So if I take that longer term view, what has been the change in cadence of equipment demand or selling on your part over the last few quarters relative to maybe a year or two ago where we were?","Stanley Bergman","Yes. Jeff, it's a very good question. I am glad you asked it. So in the quarters after we added CEREC, in particular Sirona, but CEREC in particular, we had a significant bulge in pent-up demand that we satisfied. That initial demand bulge has kind of faded out. But at the same time, we are starting to gain, I think, market share within that category from customers that we are introducing the CEREC and related lines to. So I think that's number one.","Number two is and I think we have mentioned in the past, there has been quite a bit of deflation with certain 2-D and 3-D imaging equipment, not units. I am pretty sure, I can't say for sure, but that market has now stabilized. And actually, I believe that as manufacturers come out with unique technology or improve on their offering, the price is likely to go up. So taking those two into account and looking at an aggregation of the average of, say, four quarters, I think we are in positive territory. And I do believe that practitioners are investing in their practices here and abroad and that technology can help practitioners operate a more efficient practice, increase the profitability of the practice while providing better clinical care. And yes, there is also a little bit price compression on scanners, sensors, but overall I think this is a very good market and I believe that we continue to gain market share in all the markets we are in.","Jeff Johnson","Great. That's helpful. And Steve, maybe as a follow-up, just on 2020 guidance, 6% to 9% EPS growth. It would imply, I am assuming anyway, a little bit of leverage in the model in addition to maybe some repo and other helpers below the revenue line as well. But I guess what I am trying to get or hoping you can provide some color on is, how should we think about margin gating next year? I know you don't guide on margin, but if there is some leverage to be had in the model, we have got business mix as an issue, ERP investments, restructuring. Is it going to be mainly come through OpEx where that margin can go up next year a bit and we should think about gross margins closer to how we have may be seen it here in the current quarter?","Steven Paladino","Yes. Let me provide some color. So first, when you look at our Q3 reported gross margin, it's down 33 basis points. But when you exclude the very low margin sales to Covetrus under the TSAs, it's only down about nine basis points. So that's why we are providing that level of detail, Jeff, on the TSA sales so people can look at our margins with and without the Covetrus. So really, all of our margin expansion in the current quarter is coming from leveraging expenses and getting lower expenses as a percentage of sales. I think that we would expect that to continue in 2020. But I would caution that we are not expecting the full 20 basis points or more in 2020 of operating margin expansion because of some of the things we just talked about, stranded cost and other things. We do believe that longer term, we can get back to that type of margin expansion but right now in 2020, we really don't expect that we expect a more modest operating margin expansion. And that's why we are looking to do more restructuring in 2020 because it will help us accelerate eliminating or mitigating those stranded costs as well as taking more cost out of the system to help offset some of the slight gross margin decline.","Jeff Johnson","Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Courtney Owens, William Blair.","Courtney Owens","Hi guys. So my first question is on Henry Schein One. So it appears to still be driving meaningful growth and experiencing good customer uptick. I guess, from your vantage point, what do guys really think differentiate the product at this point and given kind of feedback from customers thus far from other competitor's offering? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Well, it's very hard to do this on a telephone call and this is an area where investors are interested and I really would investors would be interested. The best thing would be to attend a briefing at one of the dental shows where we can show the product. But clearly, we had a very unique cloud-based system that is based on Ascend, that is based on Dentrix, the leading Windows-based system which is richer with features, I believe, that there is no other system that has all these features.","The system is, also both those systems, together with the three, actually four specialty software systems that we have for ortho, endo and oral surgery and the unique systems we have that service dental schools. I think 90%-plus of dental schools use our software, the military, a large DSO, all of these unique needs of these customers, in one way or another, are satisfied by the software.","In addition, we have quite unique electronic medical record software that is interoperable with many suppliers, not all suppliers yet because some supplies are still having challenges developing a software to connect. But most of, many of the leading suppliers are interoperable with us already in the areas of imaging and to some extent of digital prosthetics.","And then you move into the various kinds of digital exchange of information, whether it's credit card processing, patient financing and a big area where we, I think, have a quite an important market share is in various forms of demand generation, including risk mitigation software, website management design, it is a large offering in an area that I think is highly factionalized from a competitive point of view.","I am not sure if there is any one competitor that has anywhere near the aggregation of opportunities that we present dentists with. And that is, of course, not only in the U.S., which is what I just covered but also in international markets where we have different software covering most of what I just described.","Steven Paladino","Let me just add, Courtney, that on the Henry Schein website, the Investor Relations section of our website, we hosted a webinar for certain investors that were looking for more information on Henry Schein One and that webinar is still up on the website. So people can view that. It gives a lot of great detail on what these services and solutions are. And so I would invite investors who are really interested to take a look at it and if you have follow-up questions, call us and we will be happy to answer those questions. We could also, if people want more detail on it, we could also set something up separately for a group of investors it that's what's wanted.","The other thing I just want to add to what Stanley said is, I would say that no one has, it was kind of at the end of Stanley's remarks, I just don't want to lose it, no competitor has the breadth and level of services that we have. Some people may just have a cloud-based system. Other people may have patient engagement tools. But we really have all of the tools under one roof and they all connect with each other very seamlessly. Some of the new products are still being connected better. But I think that really differentiates us that we really can go to customers and all of their technology services and solutions can be provided by Henry Schein One.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. Our last question for today will come from the line of Nathan Rich, Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Great. Thanks. Two quick ones, if I could. Steve, first on the updated 2019 guidance, it implies a 4Q EPS number that's roughly flat sequentially. I think in 4Q, you usually see a bit of a sequential growth just with it being a higher volume quarter and you also have the DS World shift this year. So could you maybe just talk about what's driving your expectations there as we think about the cadence for 4Q?","Steven Paladino","Yes. I would say that Q4 is impacted, Q3, let me say it this way. Q3 had a significant amount of favorable timing things that happens in Q3 that will not repeat in Q4. So let me give some more details to that. So one is this Department of Defense contract that happened in Q3. We were expecting it to happen in Q4. Two is, there is little bit higher stranded cost in Q4 versus Q3. Three, we did restructuring last year in Q4 of 2018 and we won't have that same year-over-year benefit in 2019 because we are not doing restructuring in Q3 and Q4. So there is a little bit of foreign exchange headwind. So there is a number of items but I would characterize it all as largely timing between Q3 and Q4. And that's why we maintained other than tightening the range for just one quarter left in the year, we basically maintained our full year guidance.","Nathan Rich","Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then just lastly, Steve, as we kind of look out to 2020, are there any large kind of customer renewals especially on the dental side that we should have in mind? And maybe more broadly, just can you maybe talk about what you are seeing from these customers in terms of purchasing behavior and have you been able to kind of penetrate those customers, especially products? And what's driving some of the strength in the specialty businesses that you guys cited earlier?","Steven Paladino","Sure. So again, we have elected not to put out press releases and publicly talk about every time we renew or win a contract with large DSOs. But I will say that even in 2019, we renewed a couple of contracts. So we are happy with that. There is really not big activity expected in 2020 for renewals or things like that. So that should not be anything that we are concerned about. We are looking to add customers in the DSO side. So I would say that our belief is that could be next year, slightly more upside than downside. Of course, when we are working with these large DSOs on renewals, we always have to sharpen our pencil a little bit on pricing but that's expected. And I would just conclude by saying that I think our service and relationships with these large DSOs is really superb and I don't think that people want to move for very small modest financial gains because it's difficult to switch and again there is risk that service levels from others won't be as strong as ours. So we feel we are in good shape and we feel that we will continue to have a very strong market position on DSOs going forward. But there is always renewals each year that are coming up. Again 2019 included at least two renewals that I am aware of.","Stanley Bergman","And we do continue to add new accounts, both in the large account area and the midsize practices.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Stanley Bergman for any final remarks.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you operator. As we close today's call, I would like to underscore that we believe we are executing well on our growth initiatives as our strategy and value proposition continue to resonate with our customers. It is not a strategy that came together quickly. It's a strategy, a deliberate strategy that we have been executing on for the last three strategic plans, each a three-year plan and we are half, almost two-thirds of the way through 2018, 2019 and 2020 plan. We will shortly start preparing the plan for 2021, 2022, 2023.","Yesterday marked the 2fourth anniversary of our IPO. On a compound annual growth basis through the end of 2018, we grew sales by 13% and non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations by 14%. We have also provided a return on investment of 13% on a compound annual growth basis.","If you have any further questions, please contact Carolynne Borders and Investor Relations at 631-390-8105. We believe that we are well positioned, as I noted, for the future. We have a good track record, I believe an outstanding management team with a deep bench, 19,000 committed Team Schein members around the world and we look forward very much to the future.","We will be at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix and at the Greater New York Dental Show, both in November. For our investors in Europe, we hope to see you at the NASDAQ Investor Conference in London in early December. So there will be ample opportunity to meet our executives in the field. But if you have any questions, please feel free to call Carolynne with specific questions or actually visit our website. So thank you for joining us today and look forward to speaking to you on the next call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That will conclude today's Henry Schein conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you who are joining us to discuss Henry Schein's second quarter results. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company\u2019s business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.

Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. [Operator Instructions]","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Good morning, and thank you, Carolynne, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We are pleased to be reporting record sales results for the second quarter, and as an indicator of the continued success of our diversified strategy, each of our business units gained market share this quarter. This strong sales performance coupled with our ongoing expense control efforts has us on target for our full year financial plan. In fact, we are pleased that we were able to report raising the bottom of our 2013 financial guidance range by $0.05 per share. I'll provide some additional commentary on our performance in each of our business units in a moment but to just set the tone for the call, we really are pleased with the results of yet another very good quarter and the performance of each of our business units which, in the aggregate, have gained market share across the board in each of the markets that we're in. So thank you for calling in and now, let me ask Steven to review our quarterly financial results.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report overall solid results for the second quarter of 2013.","As we begin, I'd like to point out that our prior year second quarter results included onetime restructuring costs of $3.4 million pretax or $0.03 per diluted share. Exhibit B of this morning's earnings news release reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and diluted EPS from continuing operations.","Our net sales for the quarter ended June 29, 2013, was $2.4 billion, reflecting an 8.6% increase compared with the second quarter of 2012. This consisted of 8.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange.","In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased by 4% and acquisition growth was 4.7%. Our sales growth and share gains were enhanced by the timing of 2 factors that we discussed when reporting our first quarter results. First, the timing of Easter and Passover holidays impacted our U.S. business and had a more pronounced impact in Europe and Canada since it effectively added one business day to the current calendar quarter compared with last year in those geographies. Second, the timing of the IDS trade show in Germany positively impacted our International Dental equipment sales. We estimate that these 2 factors combined added a little less than 1% to our overall sales growth for the quarter.","You can note the details of sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release. Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2013 was 7.4%, an increase by 18 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2012, and that excludes those restructuring costs in the prior year.","When we also exclude the impact of current year acquisitions that were completed during the past 12 months, our Q2 operating margin expanded by 32 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 54 basis points as we continue to control and leverage our expense structure. The operating expense improvement was partially offset by a decline in gross margin of 36 basis points due primarily to 3 factors: first, greater internal sales growth in the Animal Health business, which is lower margin; second, the impact of 2 Animal Health acquisitions in the international market -- they were C&M Vetlink and AUV Veterinary Services, which accounted for approximately $79 million in sales from the quarter; and third, we did have some product mix issues across all of our businesses.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.4%, which is up slightly 0.2% versus the second quarter of 2012 and is in line with our guidance. We expect the overall effective tax rate for the rest of the year to remain in the 31% range.","Our net income attributable to Henry Schein Inc. for the second quarter of 2013 was $108.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share. This represents increases of 8.1% and 10.8%, respectively, compared with the second quarter of 2012, again excluding those restructuring costs in the prior year. I'll also note that foreign currency exchange did not have any impact on our EPS for the quarter.","I'll now provide some detail on our sales results for the second quarter. Our Global Dental sales for the second quarter of 2013 increased 6.2% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 6% growth in local currencies and a 0.2% gain related to the foreign currency exchange fluctuations.","In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 3.0%, and acquisition growth was similar at 3.0%. The 3% increase in internal growth in local currencies is comprised of 3.6% growth in North America and 1.9% growth in the international markets. I'll go through some details behind each of these figures.","The 3.6% growth in North America included 4.2% growth in our dental consumable merchandise side of the business and 1.4% growth in our Dental equipment sales and service revenue.","The 1.9% growth in International Dental market included a 1.3% decline in consumable merchandise and an 11.1% increase in Dental equipment sales and service revenue, which was of course enhanced by the IDS trade show.","Our Global Animal Health sales were $666.3 million in the second quarter, which is an increase of 13.7%. This is comprised of 14.1% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales growth was 4.2% and acquisition growth, again, primarily related to C&M Vetlink and AUV Veterinary Services was 9.9%.","Our 4.2% internal growth included 9.6% growth in the North American market and a 1.4% decline internationally. If we normalize our results to account for the switch from agency sales, our North American sales growth was approximately 4.2%. This sales growth was lower than Q1 due to a later start to the flea and tick season compared with last year where we had more unseasonably warm weather that allowed the flea and tick season to start earlier. However, I think it's important to note that we expect the sales growth for the balance of the year in North America to return to the high-single-digit levels on a normalized basis.","We believe we gained further market share in this business unit, and this marks our sixth consecutive growth of overall double-digit sales growth.","Our Global Medical sales were $387.9 million in the second quarter, an increase of 7.4% in local currencies, which consist of 6.2% internally generated and 1.2% acquisition growth. The 6.2% overall internal growth in local currencies included the same number, 6.2% growth in North America and a 5.6% growth in the international markets. Here, also, we believe we continue to gain market share in the North American segment of this business unit, and that accounts for more than 90% of the total revenues for Medical.","Our Global Technology and Value-Added Service sales was $78 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 14.5%. This included 14.9% in local currencies and a 0.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased by 9.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 5.3% to our growth. That 9.6% internal growth in local currencies included 8.1% growth in North America and 18.4% growth International with particular strength in our electronic services recurring revenue, as well as overall software sales.","During the quarter, we continue to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Specifically, we repurchased 840,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of just under $93 per share or approximately $78.1 million of cash. The impact for this repurchase on our second quarter results was not material. At the close of the second quarter, we had approximately $149 million remaining for future repurchases that were authorized by our board.","If we take a look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $274.8 million, and that compares to $178.5 million in last year's second quarter. We continue to believe that we'll have strong operating cash flow for the balance of the year.","Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 39.5 days in the current quarter, and that compares to 40 days in last year's quarter. Our inventory turns for the current quarter was 6.2 turns, and that compares to 6.5 turns in last year's quarter. It's important also to note that we no longer have any remaining inventory related to our forward buy-in with the medical device excise tax that we completed late last year. So inventory levels now have been reduced for that volume.","Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our 2013 financial guidance. Due to the strength of our second quarter results, as well as the outlook for the second half of the year, we are raising the bottom end of our 2013 EPS guidance range, and we now expect the range to be $4.86 to $4.91, and this represents a growth rate of between 9% and 11% compared to 2012 results excluding those restructuring costs. This guidance also excludes 2 onetime items. The noncash charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to the debt refinancing of Henry Schein Animal Health, which was formerly known as Butler Schein Animal Health, as well as an estimated charge of between $0.13 and $0.15 per diluted share, which we expect to take in the third quarter related to divesting a noncontrolling interest in a dental wholesale distributor that we previously announced.","Also, as always, our 2013 guidance is for current operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. Let me now turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven. As I noted in my opening remarks, we're very pleased with our second quarter results. Quite solid across the board. We are seeing an overall stable environment among our U.S. customer base, slightly leaning in the positive direction, and I have confidence that we will continue or even improve somewhat on our sales over the coming quarters.","Overseas, however, we are experiencing continued geographic weakness related to the macroeconomic factors, although there are strengths in certain markets such as Germany.","Let me now provide some more specific observations on each of our business units, starting with the Global Dental business. Internal sales results in local currencies were particularly strong in the North American Dental consumable merchandise and International Dental equipment businesses as we experienced a typical benefit from the biennial IDS trade show. During June, we announced 2 developments in our Dental unit that are noteworthy. We did announce the introduction of a new product called Realine from Align Technology, which is an entry-level, clear aligner solution designed for relatively minor crowding and space issues that general practitioner dentists see in their practices every day. Realine is ideal for adults whose teeth have shifted from -- have shifted after adolescence orthodontic treatment, and we are now actively selling this product in the U.S. This agreement is Align's first exclusive distribution partnership in North America for a clear aligner product, and we are delighted to be partnering with them on this innovation and, quite actually, innovative solution. It's pretty early to tell how this will be received by the marketplace, but our sales force is reporting very good interest in the product offering of the Realine product, and we are quite enthusiastic about this launch, which also was as I -- which actually I didn't report to the shareholders before -- was actually well received at our international sales meeting.","Also at our National Sales Meeting in June, we unveiled the all-new E4D NEVO Scanner and Design Center. The NEVO Scanner technology represents a new level of precision, proficiency and productivity compared with prior D4D systems and is based upon years of experience with powder-free and, as you know, D4D has been powder-free right from the beginning almost, image capture in the intraoral environment. This is the first scanner to use E4D's patent pending blue laser technology, and it offers dentists the potential to further improve the quality, fit and predictability of restorations. It also affords the patient a great outcome and strengthens the practitioners' clinical offering. I'm delighted to report that we are receiving extremely positive feedback from dental professions -- professionals, in other words, key opinion leaders, in the United States who are using the system from the very first time. And we are quite optimistic with this, what we view as breakthrough technology in the CAD\/CAM scanning field.","Let me now spend a few minutes on our Global Animal Health business, which notched further market share gains, we believe, during the quarter here in North America and in -- abroad. The North American growth was nearly 10%, all internal of course, and in the companion animal field primarily. International growth in local currency was approximately 19%, which was driven by acquisitions, while international internal growth declined slightly, primarily due to the macroeconomic environment in most of the countries in which we operate in. That's outside the U.S.","You will recall that early in 2012, we acquired Veterinary Instrumentation, which is the leading supplier of surgical instruments and orthopedic devices to veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom. What attracted us to this company was not only its leadership position in the U.K. but also the opportunity to bring their high-quality products to other geographies. In May, we announced the introduction of the full-service Veterinary Instrumentation product line in the United States, and we're expanding the veterinary instrument offering, therefore, from the U.K. into the United States to a greater extent than in the past, with positive results, I might add. We are committed to offering the best products and services to our customers here and so the veterinary instrument line fits in with that goal, and we're excited to bring these proprietary products to our domestic animal health customers, therefore.","So generally, quite happy with the performance of our Global Animal Health business. In the United States, we believe we continue to gain market share; likewise in Europe. Having said that, in Europe, the markets are, of course, are not growing. In the Global Medical arena, we also believe we further gained domestic market share in this business unit with strong sales growth in Integrated Delivery Networks, that's the IDNs, urgent care settings and ambulatory surgical centers. We have particularly good competency and strength to service these markets in the alternate care space. Our strategy is to focus on these types of larger customers who are continuing to grow their share of the overall foot traffic in the medical arena, and we continue to show positive results of the strategy that we have been following for the past half dozen years or so.","So now let's look at the Global Technology and the Value-Added Services businesses. As Steven mentioned, we posted particularly strong sales growth in electronic services -- reoccurring revenues, as well as sales of software products. We are also delighted to report another quarter of double-digit growth in the international software market as well. We believe that our products are very well positioned to help practitioners who are faced with challenging economic times, and the products can, of course, help them increase the profitability of their practices while, of course, increasing the quality of care. And so we believe we're well positioned to help and, therefore, showing very good growth in our international software business, as well, I might add, in our international financial services business.","Last September, we acquired a majority interest in the Canadian dental software company, The Exan Group. Exan products have strong penetration among U.S. and Canadian dental schools and are also used by Canadian dentists. About 2 months ago, we announced the release of a new French language version of the Power Practice Software system, which previously was available only in English, through Exan. The Power Practice was developed in Canada by Exan, by their local development team. And as the full -- the first full practice management software system in French, designed for French Canadian dental practices, this product has also been well received in the marketplace.","So there's a lot going on at Henry Schein. So I think it's best for me to now allow for the rest of the time of this call to respond to questions that analysts and shareholders may have. And so, operator, perhaps it's best now to ask for Q&A.","Carolynne Borders","Amy, could we please start the Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just to start on North American Dental. You saw some nice growth there, a nice step forward in the quarter, and you're specifically calling out consumables. Can you give us a sense for what you saw in the quarter, as far as foot traffic, versus price increases, versus share gains, just trying to get a sense of what was driving the growth in the quarter in North American Dental?","Steven Paladino","Well, so the consumable growth, remember we did have a little bit of tailwind for the quarter related to the timing of the holidays. But even without that, the consumable growth was over 3%. So we think that, for us, there's probably about 2\/3 of that, that is pricing and 1\/3 that's additional units. So we think we are gaining market share since we think that the overall market units is relatively flat. So we feel good that we're gaining market share. Equipment, I think while equipment was a little over 1% of sales growth, I think it's important to note that equipment, we had a very strong Q2 last year with almost 8% sales growth, so up against a more difficult comparable. But we feel good about equipment growth in the U.S. market going forward. Our backlog report shows a nice healthy increase, both domestically, as well as internationally, so both of those are good indicators. So overall, we feel like that the overall U.S. dental market has the potential to show some additional improvement. As Stanley said, that the market is stable to slightly positive in foot traffic, so we believe that, that's true. And we're hopeful that for the rest of the year, we'll continue to show those trends.","Stanley M. Bergman","Just to amplify a little bit on what Steven said. Of course, I don't think any particular group of weeks represents a trend necessarily. But our sense, and this is anecdotal, is that the U.S. dental market traffic into GPs is getting a little bit stronger and that there's a lot more optimism amongst GPs in general -- there's some parts of the country, where this may not be the case -- there's a trend towards a little bit more optimism than perhaps some months ago.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And actually just want to get one in on Animal Health. You mentioned your expectations for Animal Health in North America in the back half. But the internal growth in the International Animal Health business is a bit disappointing. Can you talk about the trends you're seeing in the major markets overseas in vet? And I guess, just as it relates to that market -- obviously, inter-quarter, we saw a fairly significant acquisition announced from your largest U.S. competitor, just wondering if you would comment on the risks or trends that we should be thinking about in that space.","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. The overall trends are a little bit different for the U.S., whereas the U.S. is stable to growing, I would say international is stable in the markets that we're in, to leaning slightly down. The U.K. market that you referenced is probably leaning in the slightly down column, and Europe is on balance, probably stable to slightly down. We do participate a little bit more in the large animal market, particularly in the Netherlands, and that market, the large animal, is not as strong as it's been in the past. As it relates to Australia and New Zealand, I think we continue to gain market share but the -- and there we're also in the large animal arena, the market is not as strong as it's been in the past. So I would say that, on balance, we feel that the markets that we're in, in the aggregate, are gaining market share slightly, but the markets are stable to slightly down. As it relates to a competitor that entered into the U.K. market, I would say that we have competitors, strong competitors in every market throughout the world. We're a good #2 player and have been a good #2 player in the U.K. animal health market for a while, several years. We're very happy with the progress of that business, have an outstanding stable management team that's been with us for a while. We've gained market share, we've improved on the efficiency of the business, we've continued to invest in that business and are very comfortable that we will continue to grow our market share in the U.K. as well. Let me add that we're also making good progress on our Practice Management software in the animal health arena, and we believe that our logistics plus our value-added software offering will continue to help us advance our market share, all in unison with some high margin products that we're adding in different markets throughout the world, such as the vet instruments offering.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess I wanted to start off with the International Dental equipment growth. Obviously, saw a pretty good impact from IDS, was that pretty much in line with what you expected, going into the show? And then, how much follow-through have you seen into Q3?","Stanley M. Bergman","I would say the follow-through after the show was pretty good. The actual orders at the show were impacted to some extent, by -- I think it was an airport strike on the Friday and there was snow. So if you lump together the orders that were received immediately before the show and after the show, we are quite happy with our performance in Germany, and actually believe we continue to gain market share in equipment field in Germany amongst the key manufacturers of dental equipment in Germany. So I think, on balance, it was a very good show and has given us good momentum going into the balance of the year. But the actual orders taken at the show were somewhat challenged because a number of our customers could not get in to deliver the orders. But we didn't miss a beat really, we picked up the orders afterwards and, overall, we're quite happy with our German business in general.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. But anyway, going back to -- I've got a quick question for you, Steve, minority interest, or net income attributable to minority holders, was a little bit higher than what we were looking for. Just wondering what's caused -- it that really just from the acquisitions and is this kind of a run rate we should be looking at on a go-forward basis?","Steven Paladino","Yes. I think the run rate -- first of all, that number being higher is a very good indicator, because that means the underlying business units that we have a controlling interest on, those -- the profitability of them is increasing, and that backs out the minority share of profits that we do not own. So I do think the run rate that we're seeing now, we should look at more consistently, again as adjusted for seasonality. The biggest driver really was the U.S. Animal Health business that had very strong profitability growth, as well as we did increase our ownership during the year slightly. So that was the biggest driver. I just want to also just remark on the last question. I think it's important on the Dental equipment sales internationally to note that, going forward, we feel bullish about international equipment sales because of the backlog report, that's up slightly at the end of the quarter, even despite the IDS trade show, and that's a very strong indicator.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Cherny of ISI.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Similar to Bob's question on Dental, I want to dive into the medical a bit. You guys have continued to perform well, from an organic growth perspective, particularly against what looks like a backdrop of challenging utilization. Can you maybe break down that what you see as some of the differences? I know, Stan, you talked about focus being on the IDNs, but in terms of what you guys are seeing in your book of business, on foot traffic versus price versus share gain, particularly given there's been some disruption recently in the competitive landscape?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. It's very, very hard to gauge foot traffic because the market is not constant any longer. You see a shift from smaller practices to larger practices, and a shift from both smaller and larger practices to acquisition by, to some extent, consolidators, but more importantly, ownership by IDNs in one form or another. There's just no data available. What we can report is that our business in the smaller accounts is not doing well. It's not doing badly but you can see that this area is definitely not where the growth is coming from. Having said that, the growth is really coming from these consolidators, whether they are IDNs or they are group practices merging with other group practices, or group practices acquiring small practices. And there's many, many different ways in which this is taking place. And that part of the business is particularly strong. One should never count one's eggs before they are hatched, but we think that we are on a very good position to continue to gain market share amongst this emerging sector, the area that we refer to as our Health Care Services group, and this is a group we put together about half a dozen years ago, and it's gaining real market share growth. I don't believe that there's any price inflation, really. I mean there's something perhaps here relative to the medical device tax, some of that's been passed on. Although in the aggregate, in our $1.5 billion business or so, I don't believe that's, that material, it's basis points. But overall, the growth that we're experiencing is from market share growth. Of course, there is some growth coming out of these urgi centers and some of the other specialty products that we've introduced over the last few years. I think we're doing well in equipment, particularly diagnostic equipment. But overall, its market share growth in units that is driving our sales here. And although it's very hard to predict every quarter going forward, we remain rather bullish on our continued growth. I don't think particular -- any particular acquisition is driving our growth in a positive direction or a negative direction. The market is consolidating and the larger players will, of course, do well because in the end, this market is driven by the capacity to deliver on value-added services to these larger customers. And for that, you need to invest a lot of money in software and other services and, I think, we've made a lot of investment already and will continue to make that investment, and those that make those investments or have the capacity to make those investments will do well.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then one other follow-up on IDS. Obviously, strong growth there for the quarter. If you think about within those markets, are there any specific product areas that were selling particularly well versus others? And obviously, Sirona, who you're partnered with over there, had a very large showing in terms of new product introductions. But any other areas of equipment, in particular, that have garnered significant interest coming off the back of IDS and anything where maybe you expected in terms of a product category to be a little stronger and it came in less than your expectations?","Stanley M. Bergman","I don't think it's that finely -- the categories are not that finely granular that I could really comment on. Of course, equipment is important to us but we have a business that's heading towards $10 billion, $9.5 billion, and the impact of IDS per se on the whole of Henry Schein is not that pronounced that we would actually look at specific categories. And Steven will be happy to talk to our equipment people and get the details for you. But I would say, IDS was good generally for CAD\/CAM imaging and even the unit sales. And I can't tell you whether there's a particular unit sale that was down or less -- was not -- didn't grow as much as our expectations or not -- that's a bit too fine for this call. What I can tell you is that, generally, our manufacturers did well at IDS, across the board. There was a good showing of new equipment but I would say also that nothing that was completely profound. I think the showing of new equipment was more or less in line with what was expected. Our sales force was ready for the new equipment and was able to process interest of customers and turn that into sales. So I don't think there was any major disappointment or major really positive surprise from the show. It was a good show. And was in line with what we expected, more or less, other than the weather, which resulted in us having to pick up orders and close the orders after the show, but I don't think that will impact, really, shipments in any particular way.","Operator","The next question is from John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Stan, a question for you, kind of along the mix topic. Can you give us a sense across your 3 main segments, the kind of momentum you're seeing with private label versus branded products? And is that influencing mix at all?","Stanley M. Bergman","I don't -- let me just think about it. On Dental, I don't believe private brand is having a material impact in any way. There may be markets that it's going up, there's certainly other markets where the branded manufacturers are responding -- by the way, you should know that, generally, in Dental, we have our biggest market share in private brand. We are essentially a branded company, and where we have a branded option, we will kick off with that. We only use the private brand where we have price competition, and this tends to be on the less technique-sensitive products and more towards the commodity and infection control commodity-type products. So I don't think there's much swing. I mean there are a couple of markets I can think of in Europe right now, where we were particularly under-penetrated in this area and others were perhaps more focused on this and we've advanced. But overall, it's quite stable. In the Animal Health area, it's a relatively small amount of the business because the business is predominantly in the branded pharmaceutical area from a sales point of view, and in the Pet Food area, and those are essentially branded products. We do sell some generics. We are increasing our sales in absolute terms on things like surgical products and instruments, et cetera, but it's not material as a percent of this almost -- what is it? $2 billion business, or more than $2 billion business, I don't think it's material. On the medical side, I would have to say that, it is growing. And it's growing because of the price pressure and it's growing, I would say, with the medsurg products in particular; we don't really sell private brand equipment. It's some small equipment and maybe private brand, we do not really have private brand reagents for machines, that's all branded. There's some private brand quick diagnostic type stuff and I don't know if that's growing, it's probably stable. And on generics, yes, on the injectable side, it's important. Although there's been a shortage of injectables, it slightly eased up. And of course, I don't know how you would classify a flu vaccine, but if you classified it as an injectable -- as a generic, of course, that is growing. And although there is a branded flu vaccine that's coming to market now, I don't think it will have a material impact on the number of doses, at least not for the foreseeable future.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great, thanks. A quick follow-up about your -- across your Global Dental equipment line. Within CAD\/CAM and digital scanning, are you seeing more momentum with the full chairside systems or with the scanner-only option at this point?","Stanley M. Bergman","I think the scanner-only option is relatively small, although will gain momentum. I think we're really at the early stages of this whole CAD\/CAM recognition by dentists. I think there's a lot of curiosity, and I think the majority, of course, of dentists that are buying these CAD\/CAMs today are buying a chairside unit. Having said that, I'd think the scanners -- there are many scanners out there, and the market will grow, it will develop. I think we're in a stage today where dentists are looking at all the options out there and I think the variety of scanners that are in the marketplace will just draw attention to this marketplace and make dentists more comparable to invest in this space. But I would say that from a dentist's point of view, at least from my gut reaction, I don't have any scientific data right in front of me, the majority of dentists that are investing in the space are today investing in the area of chairside. The whole role of the laboratory as it relates to CAD\/CAM is fascinating and that's emerging rapidly with many, many different players and lots and lots of different solutions. Of course, Henry Schein's goal is to be the #1 place for dentists to turn to and for laboratories to turn to, to understand the changes and be the trusted adviser in leading dentist\/dental labs in the area of digital dentistry from a prosthetics point of view. But we're in early stage, I think, still, with lots of excitement of us.","Operator","The next question is from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Stanley, just curious if you care to give us your expectations around flu dose volume shipments and AFPs for the back half of the year and whether we should expect that to be more weighted between the third or fourth quarter, just on the back half.","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, as it relates to expectations, at this point in time, our internal numbers, as -- I think, I don't think this is anything new, otherwise we would've changed things and we would've announced it. Very similar to last year and I don't think we're looking for much change either in volume or pricing. Of course, things could change. And it's really virtually impossible to give you the shipping dates because, as it happens, you know, the fine line in shipment between September and October is very hard to predict. So I don't think it's material in relationship to Henry Schein's performance because we will always point out the aggregate of flu vaccine shipments in doses and impact on earnings per share for the entire year, and we will make that very clear in the third quarter conference call. So I don't think it will have -- it should not an impact on our earnings per share for the year, at least from what we're seeing right now and we're not aware of any manufacturer that has difficulty.","Steven Paladino","And just to remind people, we sold about 8.6 million doses last year, so again, as Stanley just said, we do expect a similar volume this year and, again, between Q3 and Q4, from our perspective, it's just really not possible to give, at this time, any accurate projections. But we'll be totally transparent on the Q3 conference call and compare our Q3 results this year and last year. And the good part is that by the time we announce Q3 results, we'll be well into selling into Q4, so we'll be able to give indications on full year, also.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then one more, Stan. Acquisition activities have been fairly muted year-to-date. Just curious, how would you characterize the acquisition pipeline and where you see the greatest opportunities sort of mid-term?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. I mean, the pipeline continues to be as strong as ever. Muted is not reflective of what's likely to happen. Deals happen when they are ready to happen. We have more in our pipeline than we have the capacity to close, not from a financial point of view. In fact, we think our balance sheet is a little bit under-leveraged at this point in time. But more from a capacity to actually do the deals and absorb them from an internal point of view. But we are hopeful, but no promises that, in the second half of the year, we will be able to close on some deals that will bring us accretion. Not necessarily this year, of course, because of the way of the accounting treatment, but that will give us momentum into next year and the year after. So we continue to be quite optimistic. We're not going out of the dental medical vet space. Our consumables equipment and software will remain within that space. But we believe there's lots of opportunity and are hopeful that we will close some deals in the not-too-distant future. But of course, we can't guarantee until the deals are done.","Operator","The next question is from David Larsen of Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about what your preliminary expectations are for 2014 in health reform, and the decline in a number of uninsured lives, any thoughts around that?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes. It's a good question because we spend a lot of time talking to people that are in the health care delivery world and it's still rather unclear. What is clear is that health care reform is here to stay. At least the notion of insuring people that were not insured in the past and the implications of that relative to visiting -- having access to a physician rather than only being to go to the emergency room of a hospital should somebody be sick. So we see a lot more wellness programs emerging. And a lot more preventive activity. And that takes place essentially in the physician office. And we also see a marked movement from the hospital where procedures are taking place to the alternate care site for procedures. The doctor's office, the small ASC and the large ASC. And our focus is essentially on the doctor's office and the smaller ASCs. Now when it comes to the doctor\u2019s office, of course, that can be small groups and large groups. But our focus is essentially on the smaller ASCs although we do have some larger ASCs. Now a lot of is going to happen, we think, in 2014 and more in 2015. Exactly when this is going to transform -- translate into dollars, it's hard to tell. But we are doing well today without this movement resulting from increased covered lives and only expect -- and expect that there will only be more to follow as anywhere from 30-plus million Americans have access to a physician from -- in a physician office due to emphasis on wellness and prevention, and that's very exciting for our medical business. So we believe we just need to continue advancing our programs in the medical arena, and we will be the beneficiary of this trend in the years to come. But hard to pinpoint a date. I think, for sure, by 2015, we will have a nice benefit, but I think it will grow between now and then. And also, I think insurance companies, in anticipation of some of the changes, are driving activity to the alternate care site with a focus on prevention and a focus on wellness. All of this, I think, bodes well for this part of our business.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And just one more follow-up. Steve, can you just touch on SG&A? I mean, it looks like costs were managed very well in the quarter. Is this a pretty good run rate going forward, do you think?","Steven Paladino","Yes. Again, subject to seasonality and acquisition activity, I would say, yes. And it's by design, there's a continued focus on managing expenses tightly. We know that the markets that we're in are growing slower than historic norms, so we want to continue to do that. So I think it is something that we take great pride on and will continue to do going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just 2 quick ones for me. First, on the North American Animal Health for the back half of the year, will the agency sales impact on the reported results be about the same as what it was in the second quarter? I just kind of forgot when you anniversary some of that.","Steven Paladino","Yes. So again, we have been getting, for a few quarters now, what we call the normalized sales growth. So it adjusts for any shifts of agency to traditional sales or vice versa. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we do believe that for the balance of the year, that normalized sales growth will be in the high-single digits. So it'll be back to where it was in Q1. We had this anomaly in Q2 because of a very strong flea and tick season last year. And I think that roughly speaking, the delta between GAAP reported sales and normalized sales will stay consistent for the balance of the year.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the other quick one, you guys gave us some pretty good color around the International Dental equipment, but for the back half of the year, it seems you also have some pretty easy comps there versus the back half of '12. So I think, at a minimum, you should be able to sustain at least positive organic growth in that line in the back of the year, as opposed to reverting back to negative territory. Is that a fairly safe assumption just based on your comments, without getting too granular?","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, I never found a quarter in our -- my 30 years with Henry Schein that's been easy, but I appreciate the positive tone of your question. Having said that, I think our book right now, as of this moment -- of course, I can't turn this statement into any kind of calculation, I think our book of business at this point on the equipment side generally is pretty good and we are optimistic. But we have, ahead of us, the big dental show in France in November. The French economy, it's hard to tell because it's summer now and not much activity, was steady going into the third quarter. But there's very little prediction and no comfort that the economy will continue to be this way. I think Germany is stable and the U.K. is stable. And so -- and then we got Australia where we have some real challenges. About $1 billion was taken out of reimbursement by the government from a $7 billion reimbursement package. So I think it's better for us to be conservative when we prepare our internal projections. So I think we are leaning towards positive growth, but I think it's hard to confirm one way or the other. And I don't think it would be wise for us to predict where the third and fourth quarter will end up with from an equipment point of view in Europe given the volatility of those economies. But we remain very optimistic and, generally, our international businesses, whether they are dental, medical and\/or vet, have really good management teams and they're always outstanding.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glen Santangelo of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Diego Hernandez","It's actually Diego filling in for Glen, and I was just kind of wondering if you can help us out, thinking about the operating margins in the distribution businesses, which is the tech and value-added services line, and maybe how that came in versus your expectations?","Steven Paladino","Sure. Overall, again, operating margins, were up 18 basis points. Let me just pull out some of the detail between distribution as you're asking. Just give me one second to do that. As I'm pulling it out, I'll just comment that overall, we think that operating margin expansion is an important goal that we continue to believe we can get margin expansion. We always look at operating margins, excluding acquisitions or current year acquisitions, because if we buy a high or low-margin business, we kind of look at the same-store operating margin, excluding that acquisition. And for the quarter, we did show, on that same basis, excluding acquisitions, 32 basis points of operating margin expansion, x acquisitions, we got margin expansion, both in the health care distribution segment and in the technology segments. Including acquisitions though, the technology segment declined slightly, because we did buy some companies that while they have overall good margins in the teens or 20% range, they are lower than our overall technology margins. So again, because of that current year acquisition activity, it did show on a reported basis a little bit of decline. But overall, I think it's good that we increased on both components, again, x acquisitions on a same-store basis.","Operator","We do have time for one more question, and that question is from Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So 2 just quick follow-ups. One, I tend to think about consumables on the dental side as kind of your leading indicator for equipment, and consumables are getting better, then dentists probably a few quarters later are going to start buying equipment again. So in North America, it looks like we're starting to move the right direction there. But 2 quarters in a row now of the international consumables business being negative so, Stanley, I heard some cautionary comments from you on the international equipment side. But is that kind of what's leading to some of the caution there on the international side and conversely, on the North American side? Is that what's giving you some confidence in the equipment market there?","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, I can't remember the exact quarter, but my guess is 4 or 5 quarters ago, we were quite cautionary on the U.S. market, and I think we can quite safely say, as I'm making this statement, this very second, that we tend to be a little bit more optimistic, or quite a bit more optimistic, on the U.S. and I might add, the Canadian market. So that kind of sentiment or that kind of gut, and to be sure, we're talking about a couple of percentage, either away, we're not talking about massive swings one way or the other. It's that kind of sentiment that we're a little bit concerned with in Europe. Look, Germany is stable. We've had good IDS. We think, in the wake of that, there will be some business to be had in the third and fourth quarter. Having said that, Italy went through a very traumatic period. The Italian market melted. The dental market went back significantly, although we gained a lot of market share because we have capital and I think a great business in Italy, the only national consumable and equipment business. I think, although business is good-okay, in France, I think, at least if you read the newspapers, you've got to believe that the French economy is going to have some bumps along the way, although we haven't seen it dramatically from our point of view. The U.K. is a bifurcated economy. If you go into London, things are okay; if you go outside of London, some of the big cities, there are challenges. But on balance, I think we will continue to gain market share. But gaining market share is, in itself, is not as good as gaining market share within a growing market. The Netherlands had some economic challenges as it related to reimbursement. I think in a quarter or 2, we should see some positive growth as that market stabilizes. And then Australia, we had a very, very good finish to their fiscal year, which is the second quarter. In fact, we've seen some reimbursement changes, very rare do we see reimbursement changes impacting our dental business. But we have seen some reimbursement changes in Australia, and we're heading into an election. There's optimism that once the election is over, the economy will get better, I was just there the other day. And so, the rest of the world is not that material. Spain, yes, the comps are much lower than they were because the economy collapsed some time ago. So we're off lower comps. So I think it is only prudent for us to be conservative on European performance, from an equipment point of view, although consumables seem to be chugging along okay. So I just think we should be conservative and that's what I believe Steven has baked into his budgets and guidance, et cetera. But the business is in solid state. I believe that the European economy will get better at some point and we will, at that point, be very well positioned to do even better, because I think a lot of our competitors are weakened right now, and so I think -- they're weakened and we're investing in our European businesses. So I remain optimistic about our International strategy. I expect us to make acquisitions globally, no problems. And I still think our International business is likely to be closer to half in the next few years, than it is to the 35% it is today. And it will be profitable business. So, I'm sorry not to give you a perfect answer but that's the thinking right now. It's better to be a little cloudy and therefore, [indiscernible].","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. No, that's helpful, Stanley. And Steve, just a clarifying question for you on the North American Dental equipment business. Just any color you can provide on high tech versus basic in the quarter?","Steven Paladino","It was interesting because typically high tech leads for us. This quarter we saw actually very strong growth on traditional equipments. One of the things I think that is a reason, is a little bit of an anomaly this quarter because I think the people are very excited about the new NEVO Scanner for the E4D product. And I think that, as that product comes to market in, I guess, late Q3, I think people are waiting for the introduction of the new product. So I think that's also a good indicator, Jeff, because, as you know, traditional equipment, I think, is where people tend to, when they're being conservative, pull back on. And the fact that we saw good growth there, I think was very interesting. And I do agree with your earlier comments that the uptick in U.S. consumable merchandise, potentially, is an indicator of equipment sales growth going forward.","Stanley M. Bergman","So I think, Carolynne, we'd like to end at this point. Thank you very much for calling in. Thank you for your interest. We feel very good about where Henry Schein is. The morale in the company's good. Each of our businesses have their goals and, on balance, are delivering on those goals. Yes, there are some businesses that are doing better and some that are not doing as best they can, but it's -- as best we expect them to do, actually. And we have a pretty diverse portfolio, all focused on the office-based practitioner, dental, medical, animal health, and these are great markets. Preventative care is growing and baby boomers are driving business in our customers' offices. Technology is exciting, lots and lots of technology to be sold to improve efficiency of the practice, improve quality of care. There's a recognition that good oral care is good for health care. There's a recognition that preventative care is important and the health care reform is going to support that recognition. So we're very, very enthusiastic, optimistic. Our management team is in good shape. We've added, and we continue to add, to the management team, and our 3 business units, Dental, Medical, Vet, our global business units, are all fully organized in this global vertical, working with our horizontal global supply and services, the team. And so I would say, Henry Schein is in good shape right now, and we're enthusiastic about the rest of the year and working -- will soon start feverishly working on our budget for 2014 and look forward to our call in 90 days. Thank you very much. If you have questions, please feel free to call Carolynne at, what is your extension, Carolynne?","Carolynne Borders","8105. 390-8105.","Stanley M. Bergman","And Steven at 5915.

Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders ","Thank you. And my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the second quarter of 2015. With me on the call are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein, Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who are participating in this call from different locations.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking.

This will provide the opportunity for as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour that we have allotted.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley Bergman ","Thank you, Carolynne and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our second quarter financial results were solid with internal sales growth in local currencies in each of our four business groups doing well. As it was also the case during the previous quarter, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operation and of course those particularly in Europe. For the second quarter changes in currency exchange rates reduced our total sales growth by 7% and reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.07, that's $0.07 compared to the last year. Overall, the global markets we serve were healthy during the quarter and we believe we continue to gain market share. We are pleased to reaffirm our guidance range for 2015 adjusted diluted EPS and expect that our restructuring activities will continue to favorably impact our ongoing results. ","In a moment, I will provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments. But I just would like to give you a little flavor on two meetings I've just participated in here in Paris. I'm in Paris, and Steven is in New York. I spent seven hours with our international animal health team and would like to let the shareholders and investors know that this team is doing outstanding work as they execute on globalizing our animal health business and, of course, at the same time gaining market share and increasing the profitability of the business. ","Likewise, our practice solutions software team on the international side, dental, got together in Paris, too. And this was by coincidence they were both in the same city. So I decided to come over, and I can confirm also that this group is doing very well and executing our global practice solutions plan and, of course, increasing profits in that sector, too. So in a one-day period of time I experienced some really exciting activity going on here at Henry Schein.","So let me ask Steve to review our quarterly financial results with you, and then I will come back and give you some comments on performance and business accomplishments in general. So Steve?","Steven Paladino","Thank you, Stan. Good morning to all. I'm also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third-quarter 2014 conference call. As we mentioned then, this initiative is expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. ","You could look at exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release, which reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will also be discussing our results as reported and excluding these restructuring costs, as we believe the latter is more reflective of our ongoing performance. ","So now turning to our Q2 results, net sales for the quarter ended June 27, 2015, were $2.6 billion, reflecting 0.5% increase compared with the second quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 7% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies our internally generated sales increased 3.9% and acquisition growth was an additional 3.6%. You can note the details of sales growth that are contained in exhibit A of today's earnings news release.","Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 7.0%, which expanded by five basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring costs, which we believe is the more meaningful measure, our adjusted operating margin for the second quarter of 2015 improved by 32 basis points, 7.2%. When also excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, operating margin expanded by 45 basis points compared with the second quarter of last year. ","The expansion was primarily the result of an increase in sales mix towards higher margin","products. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.8%. This is on a non-GAAP basis excluding the restructuring costs, and this compares with 30.8% last year. The slightly lower tax rate is due to the implementation of ongoing tax strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower tax rates. We continue to expect that the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in this 30% range.","Turning to net income attributable to Henry Schein for the second quarter of 2015, it was $117.9 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.5% and 3.7%, respectively, compared with the second quarter. Again, excluding the restructuring costs in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $123.2 million or $1.46 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 6% and 8%, respectively, compared with last year's second quarter. ","Again, as Stanley mentioned at the onset, our foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of a full $0.07 per share on the EPS for the current quarter. If we now look at some of the detail of our sales results for the second quarter, our dental sales for the second quarter of 2015 declined 3.5% to $1.3 billion, but this 3.5% decline consisted of 4.5% growth in local currency and an 8% decline related, again, to foreign currency exchange.","In local currencies internally generated sales was 4.1% and acquisition growth was an additional 0.4%. Of this 4.1% internal growth in local currencies, we saw 3.7% growth in North America and 4.6% growth internationally. I will go through a little bit of detail behind each of these two figures.","The 3.7% internal growth in local currencies for North America included a very strong 5.4% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 1.9% decline in dental equipment sales and service revenues. In looking at North American dental equipment results, you should recall that last year's second quarter internal growth in local currencies was 10.8%. That made for a difficult prior-year comparison. If we now turn to the international business, the 4.6% internal growth in local currencies included 2%","growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and a strong 11.8% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. Of course, the growth in the international equipment business included a favorable impact on the equipment related to the IDS tradeshow.","Animal health sales were $748.6 million for the quarter, down 0.8%. But this included growth of 7.9% in local currencies and an 8.7% decline related to foreign currency exchange again.","If we look at the internal sales growth in local currencies, they were 0.6%. Additions contributed an additional 7.3% growth. I will split now that 0.6% growth between North America and international. The North America included a 4.1% decline and international growth was a 4.8% increase.","That 4.1% decline in internal sales in local currencies in the North American market was 5.2% growth when normalizing for the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales as well as the changes to our veterinary diagnostic manufacturer relationships.","Again, we believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American animal health business, and for the balance of the year until this annualizes we will continue to review our results both on a reported basis and on a normalized basis. ","Turning to our medical sales, they were $470.5 million in the second quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. This is 17.7% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline in foreign currency exchange. Internal sales in local currencies grew almost 10% at 9.9% while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.8% to growth. ","Our 9.9% internal growth in local currencies in North America was 10.4% and was led again by large group practices and IDN networks growth, and internationally we saw an additional 1.3% growth. ","Acquisition growth during the second quarter included both agency revenue as well as direct sales growth under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. I can say now that the majority of Cardinal Health physician business customers that have been acquired have transitioned to Henry Schein, and we are recording substantially all of those sales under this agreement as direct sales.","If you look at technology and value-added service sales, they were $89.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 0.4% and this included 3.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 2.9%, again related to foreign currency exchange. ","In local currencies we saw internal growth of 2.9% and acquisition growth of 4%. That 2.9% growth, breaking it up between North America and international, was 2.6% growth in North America and 3.9% internationally. ","If we look at our stock repurchase program, we're continuing to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 267,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $140.58 per share. That was approximately $38 million, and that impact on our diluted EPS was immaterial.","At the close of the quarter we had an additional $187 million authorized for future repurchases, and we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year.","If we look at some highlights on our balance sheet and cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was $207.8 million, up from $199.2 million in last year's second quarter. We continue to believe that we will have strong operating cash flow for the full year. Our accounts receivable days sales improved slightly to 39.3 days compared to 40.2 days last year, and inventory turns were slightly down, 5.8 turns this year, 6.0 turns last year.","I will conclude my remarks by reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows. For the year 2015 we adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein Inc. to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with the 2014 results. Assuming the strength of the US dollar stays at current levels, we continue to expect that the adjusted EPS may be at the lower end of this range, as we mentioned last quarter. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than US dollar, and year to date, we have experienced about $0.13 or $0.14 of negative impact in EPS directly related to the foreign exchange changes.","Our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs, which are expected to be between $0.29 and $0.33 per share, and that is related, of course, to the planned corporate initiative to rationalize the Company's","operations and provide expense efficiencies. And as always, our guidance is for continuing, current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our four business groups with dental. In North America, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies was strong at 5.4%. This growth indicates that patient traffic to dental offices continues to be solid. Indeed, for the past four quarters considerable merchandise internal sales growth in North America has been consistently in the mid-4% to 5% range. Equipment sales and service revenue in local currencies in the second quarter declined 1.9%, however, against a difficult prior-year comparison, as Stephen mentioned. We expect North American dental equipment sales and service growth to accelerate in the second half of the year with a good backlog report at this point.","Looking at international dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies returned to positive growth of 2% for the quarter compared with a decline of 1.6% in the first quarter. Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currency was 11.8%, was a multiyear high and included favorable impact from the biannual International Dental Show, the IDS, which took place this past March in Germany. So now let's spend a few minutes or a minute, actually, on the animal health side. Growth in this group was aided by strategic acquisitions in North America and internationally. Our normalized internal sales growth in North America continues to be very solid. We recently announced two acquisitions in the animal health space that will expand our global direct presence while bringing market leaders to Henry Schein . First, we announced plans to acquire a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse.","Kruuse is a leading distributor of the veterinary supplies in the Nordic countries with sales in 2014 of approximately $19 million. Kruuse will extend Henry Schein 's direct presence in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. We expect this transaction will close later in the third quarter of 2015. Kruuse offers a comprehensive portfolio of proprietary products and branded consumable merchandise as well as pet accessories, capital equipment, and pet food to veterinary clinics and retail pet stores. We plan to expand the Kruuse line of proprietary products to animal health customers across Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand as well as Asia. Kruuse serves customers in more than 100 countries through a network of distribution partners. We are delighted to enter the Nordic animal health market with a well-recognized family company. Kruuse enjoys deep customer loyalty and satisfaction as well as a reputation for quality products and strong brand awareness.","Also during the second quarter we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet, a leading animal health distributor in Romania. Maravet has annual sales of $23 million. And, like Kruuse, we have purchased our interest from the founding family, which continues to own the balance of the company. Our investment in Maravet adds to our East European presence, which we established in the Czech Republic in 2009 and later expanded to Poland with their acquisition of Medivet last year. With the recent acquisition of Kruuse, Maravet and scil, our animal health business continues to thrive while gaining market-share through a combination of organic growth and, of course, through strategic transactions. When the Kruuse acquisition closes, Henry Schein animal health business will expand to 23 countries including United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, China, Malaysia, and 17 other countries in Europe.","Now let me talk a bit about the medical business. Internal sales growth in our North American medical business continued at a double-digit pace as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs, integrated delivery networks. During the quarter we recorded sales and our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health as agency sales and direct sales as we integrated the business. Our transaction with Cardinal continues on plan with the majority of Cardinal Health acquired customers now successfully transitioned to the Henry Schein platform. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers with Cardinal by being uniquely positioned to jointly serve the entire continuum of healthcare.","So, let me conclude now with an overview of our technology and value-added services. Internal sales growth in this group in North America was 2.6% in local currencies and international internal growth rate was 3.9% in local currencies. So in North America 2.6% and internationally 3.9% in local currencies.","The advanced technology products and services we offer supports our commit to the efficiencies of delivery of healthcare services and a platform for further enhancement of sales opportunities across the entire business. The group also serves to differentiate Henry Schein from our competitors while deepening and strengthening our relationship with our customers.","The software and value-added services component on this business does very well, and we had some strong numbers that we were up against on our equipment side of this business. So overall, this business, again, continues to do very well.","So before we open the call to questions, let me give some highlights of some recent news. As we continue to advance our strategic plan, we have named Peter McCarthy President of the Global Animal Health Group. Peter has provided important leadership in the growth of our international animal health operations, most recently as President of our animal health international group.","In addition, Henry Schein recently appointed Francis Dirksmeier, Fran, as President of Henry Schein Animal Health North America, reporting to Peter. Fran brings more than 30 years of commercial leadership experience, most recently serving as General Manager of GE Healthcare in Global Asset Management and Hospital Operations. Fran's background, by the way, is significant distribution in healthcare and also software and the connection between distribution and software, resulting in the value-added services that have made a difference in the businesses he has supported over the years and now bringing that know-how to Henry Schein animal health as well.","Now, just a key component part of Henry Schein 's success is our relationship with our constituents, our suppliers, our teams, and our customers in the social outreach area. During the second quarter Henry Schein once again stepped up to support relief efforts with several disaster situations. Together with our supplier partners we committed $0.5 million in product donations to support victims of the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal. And here in the US we were active; we activated our disaster relief hotline to support customers affected by severe storms and flooding in the South Central region of our country while also providing support to our nongovernmental organization partners and their need for healthcare products to assist in relief efforts. So these are but two examples but are key in driving morale, customer support, supplier support and, of course, morale generally in the Company and amongst all of our constituents.","Educating future generations of dentists and supporting advanced technology are both ongoing commitments of Henry Schein. We combine these two passions. We are proudly announcing the creation of the Henry Schein Digital Center of Excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia. Expected to open in the next 12 months, this center will serve as the digital dentistry training lab for students, faculty, and alumni, and will be equipped with the latest innovations of digital technology from Henry Schein and our supplier partners.","We are committed to advancing our position, our global position in digitalized dentistry and, at the same time, combining that with closer relations with our customers and educational institutions that graduate our customers in the dental, medical, and veterinary space. In late June we were honored to be selected as Corporation of the year by the Association of Hispanic Healthcare Executives, in recognition of our commitment to increase diversity and cultural competency in healthcare professions.","And last, we continue to climb up the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. We have been named to this list for the past 11 years and now rank 287th, up from 292 a year ago. Our inclusion in this prestigious listing is testament to this shared commitment and value of the more than 18,000 Henry Schein members across the globe, all of whom are dedicated to helping practitioners improve the efficiency of the practice and provide quality care.","And the fact that we were ranked and have been ranked, really, since we have been listed as a Fortune 500 company as one of the Most Admired Companies in health care distribution, being ranked number one this past year again, is really a testament to our team, our customers, and our suppliers. So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, Steve and I are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo","Thanks and good morning. Stan, just curious about some of your comments on the medical segment, it's clear the Company continues to post pretty impressive growth there. For a number of quarters you've highlighted a focus on large group practices and integrated delivery networks. I'm kind of curious. Can you maybe comment on the Cardinal Health relationship? And Steve, I don't know if there's any way to maybe roughly quantify how much of that added and we should think about as we think about modeling going forward, like when you may anniversary that benefit, and just some overall sense for maybe how fast the market may be growing organically.","Stanley Begrman","Steven will give you the financial aspects. But the relationship, which is really a three-pronged relationship, has done quite well for Henry Schein and, in our belief, for Cardinal as well. On the first line of the equation is the fact that we have taken over distribution of Cardinal's product line and, of course, it's sales to customers that are small practitioners. Then, on the other side is the IDNs, the large group practices, the large multiple locations managed by IDNs as well as group practices. And that has also gone very, very well for us. That business has primarily transitioned to us. But this is all built on a relationship where we are securing product, owned brand product from Cardinal","and doing some joint procurement. And that is also working quite well for us. So the customers that are being serviced by Henry Schein , former Cardinal customers, I believe, are very happy with the service we are providing and at the same time will be benefiting from the Cardinal brand [products], and our pricing opportunities in this marketplace will also help our customers and help drive operating margin at the Henry Schein side. I hasten to also add that the internal growth from the Henry Schein core business, which is significantly now focused on IDN large group practices, is also performing very well when you exclude the impact of Cardinal, which in itself was also doing well.","Steven Paladino","So, Glen, just on the second part of your question, so really Q2 was the first quarter that we recorded direct sales from the transaction. At Q1 we were recording effectively agency sales, but as we started the integration process during Q2, as we integrate sales onto our platform we record direct sales. You can see that the acquisition sales growth was 4.6% for the quarter. It will annualize. We are continuing to integrate. We would expect that the integration will continue probably through the better part of Q3. At that point we should have all or virtually all of the sales on our platform. The run rate that I would use for modeling going forward is something north of maybe $250 million but I don't have a more precise number at this time. And that will get phased in, starting with Q4 we will probably be at that rate. And that's on and all direct sales basis, assuming that there's no more agency sales at that point. And there should be some growth to that, of course, as we continue to add product assortment and we continue to drive growth to those customers.","Glen Santangelo","Okay, that's helpful. Maybe if I just ask one quick follow-up on the dental equipment, obviously appreciate that you had a difficult comp this quarter. And Stan, if I heard you correctly, I think you are assuming that that business should start to get a little bit better in the back half as you focus on what your order book may look like. Then I'm kind of curious -- did you mean that you think the overall equipment business is getting stronger or you think just the growth rate will look better in the back half due to perhaps easier comparisons? So just any clarity in terms of what you were saying would be helpful.","Stanley Begrman","Yes. On Steven's comments on the growth rate per se, to the extent that we have that information, because it will be talking about a future situation -- having said that, I can comment on the fact that our backlog is up quite nicely in North America and that we also have similar view of our backlog internationally. So we are quite optimistic about the sale of equipment in the second half of the year. And I assume that some of that is because the market is good but some of it is also because of the Henry Schein operate","and our effectiveness in gaining market share. ","Steven Paladino","So yes, so we feel that again, Stanley said a couple of the key points. Our backlog at the end of the quarter both domestically and internationally is up very nicely, so we feel good about that for future growth. Remember, that backlog covers primarily traditional equipment, not the high tech equipment. But that's a good indicator of the traditional equipment. Remember we are going through a little bit of transition. We added the A-dec line, so there is a learning curve. And there is that that we're focusing on in the U.S. I would say that if you look at the components in North America, I think the bright spot of the equipment was traditional equipment, was the bright spot for us. We were a little bit soft on technology, in large part because PlanScan had upgrades last year but still soft in technology despite that. But we are feeling good, like equipment is going to be a good driver for us for the second half of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Steve, just one or two quick follow-ups on the equipment comments you just made -- I guess one with A-dec. Is that driving kind of upside to your equipment numbers right now? Is it drawing out purchase decisions as your sales reps go and take that line in front of clients? Just wondering kind of any color on how that's working into your portfolio at this point?","Steven Paladino","Well, it's really very early on. We just started, we just got access to the line, as I think you know, late in Q2. So we went through a training program with our sales force. I would say that we would expect a net improvement in overall traditional equipment sales by adding this line. But it's really too early to really try to quantify it at this point. Maybe in Q3 or certainly in Q4 we can give a little bit more color on that.","Jeff Johnson","All right, and then just one question on the European dental comments or on the international dental business. The recovery on the consumable side that you saw the plus 2% last quarter it was down some. I mean as you kind of look in hindsight now over a trailing six-month period, is market getting a little bit better there? Was there just something weird going on in the first quarter? I mean what do you think contributed to that first quarter decline, a little recovery now? Is there really any change in end market dynamics going on, or was there just some funky timing issues in there, anything like that?","Steven Paladino","Well, I think the market is slowly improving in Europe, not quite as quickly, obviously, as the U.S. If you recall last quarter, we specifically called out three markets that saw declines in the international dental market -- Germany, Australia and the UK. And we did say at that time we don't believe they are trends; it's a little bit, as you said, that kind of funky, quirky ebbs and flows. And for the current quarter we have positive sales growth in each of those markets, so our estimate was correct that we talked about last quarter. And I think we\u2019re expecting -- again, European markets are not doing as well, again, as the U.S. But we do think they are very slightly improving year-over-year.","Operator","Next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Stan, since you have been spending a lot of time with your international group, can you just give us your sense how many countries are you in at this point? And of those, maybe what the top three or four opportunities are that you think are most substantial over the next, say, three years?","Stanley Bergman","So first of all, with the closing of Kruuse we will be in 33 countries now. And of course we do service, especially on the dental side, dentists throughout the world through, as I mentioned, 33 -- we are actually on the ground in distribution centers, call centers, and fuel sales people in 33 countries. I will say to you that Europe presents a good opportunity for us. We are going to be going against lower comps as the year progresses and I think we will be seeing some good growth in a couple of markets as the year progresses and I think, going into next year. So in Europe as a basket, which took a bit of a hit last year, is, I think, recovering as you saw, the German equipment numbers and the equipment numbers in general were pretty good, driven largely by Germany but not exclusively by Germany.","So I think equipment appetite is good. I think there is a growing demand for digitalized dentistry both in the dentist's office, chair side dentistry, chair side digitalized prosthetics, and in the laboratory, which is not only interested in ensuring that the customers have scanners to submit the prosthetics but also, within the lab, where there is a lot of opportunity for digitalized equipment. We are seeing this quite nicely coming out of the Arseus acquisition but not only out of that acquisition, which in itself leads to block sales, where we see good margin and some unique opportunities for Henry Schein in that space. So that leaves, of course, into consumables. And I think it is fair to say that, although the markets in Europe are a little bit anemic, they are getting stronger. And Henry Schein , I think, will continue to gain market share.","There is nice opportunity in Australia and New Zealand on the dental side, and I would say on the animal health side too. And let me just go back. I think our European animal health business is also in very good shape. We've got good products, great management, and some really good opportunity. And if you go around the world, I have to say that the dental business in Australia presents Australia and Brazil presents really nice opportunity as well. If you go out the longer I think we are quite optimistic about our business in Asia, although there's a lot more work to be done in establishing the platform. And we are hopeful that over time we will be able to extend our presence in Japan and China. So we are quite optimistic about our international business.","John Kreger","Thanks very much, maybe one quick follow-up. If you look at the order flow that you got out of IDS, were there any surprises in that, any categories that did better or worse than what you might have anticipated?","Stanley Bergman ","No. I think the order book was good, traditional business, CAD CAM. And I think the halo of IDS is continuing to drive some of our CAD CAM business around the world both in terms of sensors and when I say around the world, I mean in Europe, in Germany particularly that I would say the whole of Europe, in terms of sensors and mills and related software. So I think this was more or less all the areas that usually we expect to grow, the traditional and CAD CAM. But I think we will see extra momentum during the rest of the year from the CAD CAM side.","John Kreger","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block","Great, thanks and good morning. Well, if I can just start maybe on the vet side, Steven, I think I've got these numbers correct. Obviously there's a lot of adjustments but I think you said the adjusted North American vet sales was, I believe, 5.2%. It's a solid number but it is a notable step down versus, I think, what was it, 13.6% adjustment last quarter. And clearly, the overall industry momentum seems to be continuing. So is there anything to call out in North American vet? I just bring it up because we've heard chatter of overall in-clinic pricing pressure. Are you guys seeing that? Is that reflected in the step-down in the growth rate? Or is this just more bouncing around and the volatility in the near-term?","Steven Paladino","So we don't think it's a change in, A, market conditions; B, any unusual or significant pricing issues in the market. As I think, in the animal health market with weather, when people or when the veterinarian is buying certain products, there are always a little bit of fluctuations there. So we are not reading anything into I agree it is a step down. We are not reading anything into the overall change. We still think the markets are healthy. We still think that we can see acceleration of the markets as the flea and tick season continues.","So we are feeling like there's no major similar to what we talked about just a minute or two on dental. And I said we saw Q1, where a couple of markets in Europe were down. We didn't think it was something market related, and the consumable merchandise in those three markets were up in Q2. So hopefully that's clear.","Jon Block ","Okay. No, that's very helpful. And just to shift gears, Stanley, I might be asking this a different way than Glen earlier. But you called out the solid consumable growth in North America now for a number of quarters, maybe arguably four quarters plus. It seems like you need some decent growth in the back half of the year to get to the low to mid-single digits. But can you just reflect, in the past when that better consumable growth starts to seep into the mind of the dentists, they feel better, want some better efficiency in their practice and then you see that reflected in the equipment numbers, what sort of lag has that been historically? And can we see as a result of that a step up in equipment in North America in 2016 and beyond? Thanks, guys.","Stanley Bergman ","Yes, good question. I think the psychology in the down markets in North America specially U.S. I was going to say the US; I am referring to the whole of North America is a positive one. And I think dentists are realizing it's a good place, their practice is a good place to invest. So if you look at some of the technology out there, which helps increase the efficiency of the practice, improves on the workflow, resulting in a better experience for the customer and better productivity, you put the mindset together, the optimism that technology can bring to the practice and the ultimate efficiency and productivity, it leads to a good mindset in technology-driven products. And so, I think that's where we will see quite a bit of upside. In addition, I think dentists are feeling pretty good and should be in a position, we think, for the remainder of the year to invest in some of the traditional equipment. I think our expanded line will help us in that regard from a pure Henry Schein point of view. So I think it's less to do with a specific uptick, couple of basis points here or there, and more to do with the mindset, which is pretty good right now in dentistry. Having said that, the traffic is improving and I think from a pure Henry Schein point of view we are gaining market share as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cherny with Evercore ISI.","Michael Cherny","Good morning, guys. I want to follow up a little bit on the animal health questions. I know it's not your protocol to give revenue guidance, by any means. But in terms of the headwinds you saw relative to the agency change and also the diagnostic shift, is there any way to give a sense on a next six-month basis how those headwinds, roughly, do you think will impact you? I know you reiterated guidance, so clearly that's baked into the numbers. But just trying to understand, again from a modeling perspective, how should we think about that area within North American animal health on a go-forward basis?","Steven Paladino","Well, again, we would prefer not to give specific revenue guidance on that. But I think we are comfortable enough to say that we do think that we will see some degree of improvement for the second half of the year in North American animal health as adjusted for the normalized growth. But save that comment, I don't think we really want to give a specific metric on growth there. ","Michael Cherny","No, that's fine, Steve. Figured I'd try. And then just relative to the M&A landscape, as crazy as this sounds, by my count it seems like you have actually slowed down on the total number of deals you have been executing on. Have you seen any changes in terms of the dynamics, in terms of what types of valuations or what types of opportunities that these sellers are looking for in terms of the type of assets that you are pursuing?","Steven Paladino","Well, one, I'm not sure I would characterize it as a slowdown at all. You know the way acquisitions work. They have a timeline all their own and they bunch up sometimes, and they take a little bit more time sometimes. So I would say our pipeline is as full as it's ever been. I would say that I know the market has seen some very unusual pricing, very, very high pricing in a couple of properties. But that's not indicative of the overall market. The overall market the pricing is much more stable. So I would say that, no, there is no slowdown, A. And there is no major change in pricing. ","Michael Cherny","Got it, just timing related. Understood, thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. ","David Larsen","Congratulations on a very good quarter. Steve, can you talk about the pipeline for animal health deals? It looks like maybe an 11% contribution there this quarter. It has been very high for the past four quarters. Just any thoughts on what that is going to look like going forward?","Steven Paladino","Well, there's a lot of activity. I don't like to really predict what's going to close and when it's going to close because it's absolutely very difficult and maybe not even possible. But we haven't closed the Kruuse deal, as Stanley mentioned. We expect to close later in the current quarter. There is activity with other animal health, also dental and medical acquisitions. So as I just said, I think the acquisition pipeline is good, is strong. It's probably as strong as it's ever been. But again, it's hard really to say, okay, add X million dollars of revenue for next quarter when the timing is really not predictable.","David Larsen","Okay, great. And then with North America, again a very good number, I think it is 10% internal sales growth this quarter, 12% last quarter. These are very robust growth rates, significantly higher than 1Q of 2014. Just, Stanley, any thoughts on what is driving that? Is it the Affordable Care Act, increases in coverage? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Yes, so I think we've discussed this in past calls, and let me reemphasize it because it's working. Six or seven years ago we commissioned two studies. One is the area that is likely, the part of healthcare that is likely to be moving the most rapidly, and we determined that to be the alternate site, and the physician provider, because of the anticipated healthcare reform implications, namely wellness and prevention. So we decided to focus on the physician side of healthcare. And we said to ourselves as part of that, what kind of physician providers? And we determined it's likely to be larger groups, so consolidation of practices into larger groups and, at the same time, IDN, integrated delivery networks would be expanding their presence into this large group arena. So we set up our healthcare services group, I think it's seven years ago, to focus on this part of the medical business. And we focused very deeply on it. We were not distracted with acquisitions. There were some very large properties available that service the smaller practitioner groups or some of the single practitioners and one, two, three practitioner. We focused on the large group practices and the IDNs through our healthcare services group. And that has done very well. At the same time we said to ourselves, what are the specialties that are going to be the most productive from sales point of view and more importantly from a margin point of view? And we determined which specialties we wanted to focus on. And we did that as well. If you take the two together, it's resulting in top-line growth, internal growth and of course operating margin expansion in our medical group. You put that together with our cardinal alignment, and it's an acquisition of their sales in the space. But then you add to that the procurement opportunities that we had to procure costs under their brand and to jointly advance better procurement between our two businesses, and the net result is top-line growth and margin expansion for our medical business.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich","Steve, just wanted to see if you could give us some more color on how the diagnostic change in animal health is going. I think your sales reps are selling both Abaxis and Heska, wondering which products are doing better, how are the sales reps doing in terms of getting traction with those products?","Steven Paladino","Sure. Well, I'd rather not say which one is doing better or not better; they are both actually doing well. We feel that both product lines are very strong product lines. My understanding is the sales force has quickly moved and understands the product lines. Compared to what our goals are internally, we feel very good about this whole transition. But I just want to be clear. This is not a one or two quarter transition. Remember, as people, especially with the diagnostic equipment, as people replace diagnostic equipment and as leases and other things come up over a multiple year period, that's when you have an opportunity to convert customers. So only this is the second quarter out of the box, and when this initially came to light I immediately said this is not a one or two quarter process, this is a one or two-year process. So right now, in the early innings, if you will, we feel good about what we have accomplished. But there is still a lot more activity, and there is still a lot more that we need to accomplish.","Kevin Ellich","And then just another one, for Stan, we've seen some good M&A activity out of you guys in Europe for animal health, but in the U.S. one of your competitors made a big move into the livestock distribution business. From a strategic standpoint, is the production animal market something that you want to get bigger in? Just wondering what your thoughts are on livestock?","Stanley Bergman","So we believe the animal health business is a good business because of demographics. The elderly, the baby boomers spending more money on their pets. So that's one. And the middle class in the rest of the world, the developing world, et cetera is growing. And that results also in pet advancements. But within there lies the demand for protein as well. So we believe that is an opportunity. Not sure if distribution of branded pharmaceuticals is necessarily the best play in that space. It may be. But there is opportunity for niche products with high margin. And so, for example, I think the Kruuse opportunity will be very, very good for us. The scil opportunity will be very, very good for us on the equipment side. And the veterinary instrumentation offering in the instruments side will be very good for us. We're adding resource in that space, expect to add more products over time, getting more margin, and have a very profitable business that will be focused on the large animal side as well.","But I'm just not sure if the tonnage, lots and lots of sales in branded pharmaceutical, is the way to go and whether that's the place to put capital. And certainly not the place, in our view, to put capital at a very expensive cost to put that capital to work. But we do see opportunity in the space and we do business in a number of countries in the large animal space and dairy space and the various other areas and remain quite optimistic about that. But I think our play will be a little bit different, given our strengths in the business today and the opportunities ahead of us.","Going back to the question on the diagnostics, we were of course taken by surprise in this space. But I believe that our team has come together quite quickly in putting together an excellent offering, a global offering of diagnostics. We are working very well with Abaxis and Heska. And in combination with our practice solutions business, the software business here in the United States and abroad, and our big data opportunity will, I think, have some really exciting opportunities for our customers and our suppliers going forward. So, although we were quite surprised by what happened, considering that we had what we thought was a good relationship with the supplier, we remain very, very optimistic, specifically with our Axis-Q bidirectional integrated solution that improves workflow and reduces missed patient opportunities in the practice. So, we have added good resources in that area, have really good management, good team in the diagnostics space, more to follow and remain very, very excited both in the equipment arena and with the rapid test. It's amazing how many suppliers have come to us from around the world to say, now we see","an opportunity for you in the space. But our anchor, of course, in the model is Abaxis and Heska.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","Dave Francis","Hi. Good morning. Stanley actually walked into the area I wanted to ask about. You guys have talked in the past about the opportunities that you have in terms of the data that you have collected relative to your customers' ordering patterns and tying that in with some of the technology offerings that you have as well. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you guys stand in terms of accelerating some higher-level marketing activities and being able to lever some of those data assets into higher revenue growth rates in the near to intermediate term.","Stanley Bergman","Right, very good question. We have had database marketing really going back to almost 25 years ago when we launched our mail-order business. And really we have, in the markets we serve, the finest database relative to products, customer specialty, etcetera, and have done good with that opportunity, leveraged it quite nicely for the benefit of our suppliers and our customers over the last 25 years. It's a key driver in our success. We combine that data, of course, with tele sales and field sales consultants and e-commerce marketing. Having said that, about a month ago we actually launched our big data division to capitalize on the opportunity of the data we had in our practice management world but also in the Henry Schein databank, our products and related services that we sell. ","So we have brought on a very senior executive to manage that for us and are very excited with that opportunity on the general medical and vet side. And it will, of course, be a division that is focused on driving stickiness with our customers. But actually we expect this to be a business that will generate profits as well to the bottom line, positioning us to capitalize on our data but also, of course, to drive growth, effective growth through ecommerce and other ways in which we sell.","Q - Dave Francis","That's very helpful. As a quick follow-up, Steve, I want to turn it back to the animal side. You specifically called out in the press release, talking about the North American business, shifts between agency salesand direct sales.Can you peel back the onion there a little bit and just talk a little bit more about the dynamics there? What are the shifts one way or the other, and how that might be impacting revenue growth rates in that line of business and how we ought to think about that over the next few quarters?","Steven Paladino","Sure. Well, so that was just part of two comments. Right? We normalized for the shift in agency as well as the diagnostic manufacturer change, as well as the, those two items. The smaller of the two was the agency to direct sales. The impact on animal health was about 1% because of the shift in the second quarter. So the bigger impact, obviously, for the normalization was the diagnostic manufacturer change. ","So we don't expect going forward, we don't expect really it's hard, really, to predict. But we don't really expect that to change that much. It will still be a small, maybe 1% or less than 1% impact to our normalized sales growth.","Dave Francis ","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette","Hello. Thanks good morning. Stan and Steve. So I guess, as you guys touched on earlier, the internal growth in medical obviously is very strong. But just curious, without naming any names, are there any key competitors that might he losing share for any specific reasons that you are capitalizing on? Or is it just generalized market share gains for Schein within these larger group practices?","Stanley Bergman ","Well, I'm not sure about who is losing business or who is not because what we are seeing is a massive consolidation amongst solo practitioners going to three, four, five in the practice, the 5s to 10s, the 10s to bigger. And so, bigger business is coming from all over. And we see even further consolidation in this marketplace with fewer distributors, stronger distributors, and distributors that have the software, the intelligence, information intelligence to service these accounts. And so, I would imagine in the future as we go forward, and also in the animal health and dental space, economies of competency will drive the business and, in order to have competency specialization you need large sales basis to amortize this competency. So I think I can leave it up to your imagination where the business is coming from. But I would say we are getting it across the board.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. And then for what it's worth, obviously we hear about some of the medical distributors to the hospital and\/or IDN market expanding into distribution of more sophisticated SKUs that previously may have been marketed directly by some of the manufacturers or suppliers. I'm just curious; is there any sort of dynamic at play within the IDNs that you service where you may be expanding to categories or products that you distribute that might be driving extra growth? Or is that not really a factor for you guys in your medical programs? ","Stanley Bergman","I would say that to take any five-year period and I would expect us to go forward in our dental, medical, or vet business, you will see the movement from direct manufacturers to distribution. And this is -- we have had one particular example in vet where it went the other way. But generally, I think the smarter manufacturers understand the value that distribution brings, of course, in the logistics. But that's not the area; it's in the value-added services. And in our particular cases, we have 4,000 field sales consultants around the world that are specialists in practice management, understand how a practice should be run, and help our customers operate a more efficient business so that they can provide better clinical care. And that drives manufacturers moving towards us, and I believe that's the case in all three businesses. ","Steven Valiquette","Okay, great. Okay, thanks. ","Stanley Bergman","Okay. So thank you, everyone, for calling. I think you can get a feel that we are quite excited about our business. Of course, we have challenges like every single business does. And, in particular, the biggest challenge we have right now is the relative exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro. And we are working very hard and expect to be successful in mitigating that conversion risk with other areas of increased profitability in the business.","We are advancing our strategies in geographic expansion, market share growth, margin expansions through advancing product that present greater value to our customers, greater margin, and are managing our expenses, expecting to reap some benefits from the restructuring that we announced last year. So we remain optimistic about the business. And so thank you for calling.

And on the bottom line, we delivered strong year-over-year diluted EPS growth for the quarter of 10.9% on a GAAP basis and, on a non-GAAP basis, 12.6%.","For the year, net sales of $11.6 billion were up 8.9% compared to 2015 with 6.7% internal growth in local currencies excluding the estimated impact of the extra week. While diluted EPS growth was 8.8% on a GAAP basis or 10.9% on a non-GAAP basis.","Coming off a successful year, we are affirming guidance for 2017. Diluted EPS that represents growth of 16% to 18% compared to 2016 GAAP diluted EPS or growth of 8% to 10% compared to 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS. I believe the message you will hear today is that the end markets we serve are experiencing consistent growth and we are focused on continued execution in delivery on our financial objectives. Of course, we did have a slight slowdown in the growth, in the middle of last year, in the middle of the summer \u2013 the early part of summer of last year, which we still cannot explain. But we believe that at this point in time, the end markets we serve are, in fact, experiencing consistent growth.","In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. But first, Steve will review our financial results in a bit more detail. So, Steve, over to you.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $16.1 million pre-tax or $0.15 per diluted share. And our 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pre-tax or $0.11 per diluted share.","For the full-year, our full-year 2016 results also include restructuring costs. Those restructuring costs are $45.9 million pre-tax or $0.42 per diluted share and full-year 2015 results include restructuring costs of $34.9 million pre-tax or $0.32 per diluted share, as well as a one-time income tax benefit, net of non-controlling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted shares.","When I discuss our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis, the non-GAAP basis will exclude the restructuring costs and the one-time tax benefit in the prior year. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparisons of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes, and should not be regarded as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures. You can see Exhibit B in this morning's earnings release that has a complete reconciliation of those non-GAAP adjustments.","Okay, let me also point out that the fourth quarter of 2016 included one additional selling week compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. This week is the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's. We report on what's called a 52\/53 week fiscal year ending always on the last Saturday in December. So, the next time our results will include an extra selling week will be in 2022. So, in order to facilitate more meaningful comparisons, we will provide a separate estimate. We are providing a separate estimate of the impact of the extra week on our sales growth, as well as providing internal sales growth in local currencies excluding that impact.","Okay, so turning to our results now. Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 billion, reflecting a 9.5% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Our internally generated sales, in local currencies, were up 4.2%, acquisitions contributed 1.3%, there was a 1.5% decrease due to foreign exchange, and the growth attributed to this extra week was estimated at 5.5%. You could see all of these details of our sales growth contained in Exhibit A in our earnings news release.","Our operating margin, on a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 6.9% and contracted by 18 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. There are three key elements that negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin that I'd like to discuss and these three key elements negatively impacted operating margin by about 30 basis points in total.","The first item relates to acquisitions completed during the first 12 months and the related expenses as well as switches between agency sales and direct sales in our Animal Health business which combined to negatively impact the contraction by 7 basis points for the quarter. Secondly, influenza vaccine sales this year had a lower margin compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted our operating margin by 15 basis points. And the third item relates to an increase in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year and that negatively impacted the contraction by 8 basis points. If you were to exclude the net impact of these three items, our operating margin expanded by 12 basis points.","Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.4% that compares to 30.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The tax effect of the restructuring costs recorded in the fourth quarter increased our effective tax rate by about 20 basis points in 2016 and about 30 basis points in 2015.","Our full-year 2016 effective tax rate was 28.8% on a GAAP basis and, again, the effect of restructuring costs recorded for the full-year increased the effective tax rate by another 20 basis points in 2016 and 30 basis points in 2015. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% range.","I'd also like to note that in 2017, we are implementing a new accounting standard called ASU 2016-09. This new accounting standard requires excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation to be recognized as a reduction in income tax expense in the period which the stock awards vest.","As a result, we expect our effective tax rate to be favorably impacted in 2017 and this will primarily occur in the first quarter as this is when most stock-based awards at Henry Schein vest. This impact will occur each year in Q1 and will have varying effects on the annual effective tax rate. Therefore, because of this, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, this is for Q1 only. And we still expect that this Q1 impact is included in our estimated effective tax rate for the full-year which, on a full-year basis, will remain in that 28% range.","Our net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. on a GAAP basis was $139.2 million or $1.73 per diluted share. That represents increases of 7.1% and 10.9%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding restructuring costs, non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter was $151.3 million or $1.88 per diluted share. And that represents increases of 8.6% and 12.6%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, also on a non-GAAP basis.","I'd like to point out that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.02 and this was partially offset by share repurchase benefit of approximately $0.01 for the quarter.","So, let's now look at some detail on our sales results for the fourth quarter. Our Dental sales for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 7.7% to $1.5 billion. Internally generated sales in local currencies were up 1.6%, acquisitions contributed an additional 1.7%, there was a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange, and growth attributed to the extra week was estimated at 5.4%.","We look at North America, our North American internal growth in local currency was 2.2% and included 1.9% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 2.7% growth in dental equipment sales and services revenue. As I mentioned last quarter, there was some acceleration of our equipment sales from Q4 to Q3 and that was associated in part with promotional activities that we discussed on our last conference call.","It's also important to note that we saw strong growth in the North American consumable merchandise and equipment sales in December, even excluding the estimated impact of the extra week. I'd also like to reiterate that our growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals earlier this year. This is something we've also talked about on the last few conference calls. This decision negatively impacted our North American dental consumable merchandise sales growth in the quarter by about 50 basis points and this will continue for one additional quarter \u2013 first quarter of 2017, at which time it will annualize.","International dental internal growth in local currencies was 0.7%, included 2.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise, and 3.9% decline in dental equipment sales and service revenue. This decline was primarily due to a difficult prior year comparison in international equipment sales and service revenue. We also expect the softness in international dental equipment sales to continue in Q1 as we approach the IDS trade show, which is in late March, and anticipate an acceleration of equipment sales thereafter.","On an overall basis, we continue to believe we outpaced the global dental market in Q4 and believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remains strong.","Turning to Animal Health sales, they were $837.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10.8%, internally generated sales in local currencies was up 8.2%, acquisitions contributed 0.4%, there was a 3.4% decrease due to foreign exchange and growth attributed to the extra week is estimated at 5.6%. The 8.2% internal growth in local currency has included 10.3% growth in North America and 6.3% growth internationally. When normalizing for Animal Health results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales, that 8.2% internal local currencies was 7.8% growth and included 9.3% growth in North America.","We believe this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. These were solid results as we believe we continued to gain market share both domestically as well as overseas.","Our Medical sales for the quarter was $621.1 million for the fourth quarter and that was an increase of 10.6%. Sales growth in local currencies was 4.4%, all internally generated, with 0.1% of small decrease due to foreign exchange, and growth attributed to the extra week estimated at 6.3%. It's important to note that timing of influenza vaccine sales negatively impacted the Medical sales growth by 1.2%. And if you exclude this impact, our sales growth in local currencies was 5.6%. Of this 4.4% growth, 4.5% was in North America and growth of 0.9% in local currencies internationally. We are pleased with our Medical growth as we also believe we gained market share in this business unit.","Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $112.2 million in the quarter, an increase of 19.6%. That consisted of internally generated sales in local currencies, up 8.5%, acquisitions contributing an additional 9.8%, and a decrease due to foreign exchange of 1.9%. And finally growth attributed to the extra week is estimated at 3.2%. Of that 8.5% internal growth in local currencies, 7.4% was in North America and 13.9% growth internationally. The Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth in local currencies was highlighted by solid growth in both our software services revenues in North America as well as internationally.","We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter, more specifically we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $156.10 per share and that equated to approximately $200 million. The impact of this repurchase on shares for the fourth quarter was positive by about $0.01 per share.","For the full-year of 2016, we repurchased $550 million of our stock, representing 3.5 million shares at an average price of $158.88 per share. And while this was above our originally stated goal, we saw an opportunity to be more aggressive when our stock price declined.","Our share repurchase program continues to demonstrate our long-term commitment to create further value to shareholders and reflects our confidence in long-term prospects of the business. At the close of the quarter, Henry Schein had about $250 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. And we continue to believe that our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large of portion of annual free cash flow to both repurchases and acquisitions, continues to drive increased shareholder value.","Let's briefly look at our balance sheet and cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was $264.5 million. That compares to $298.3 million last year. For the year, the operating cash flow was over $600 million \u2013 $615.5 million to be exact. Our CapEx for the year was $70.2 million and that results in free cash flow of $545.3 million for the year.","As I mentioned earlier, we are really pleased to have exceeded our goals related to cash flow for the year. Accounts receivable days outstanding was about 41.3 days. That compares to 39.3 days last year. Our inventory turns was 5.5 turns for quarter. That compares to 5.6 turns last year.","And finally, I'd like to conclude by reaffirming our 2017 guidance for the year. Our diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $7.17 to $7.30 for 2017. I'd like to point out that if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, we may come in at the low-end of this range. And obviously, we can't predict well what's going to happen with the U.S. dollar so we just wanted to point out that we do have sensitivity to the U.S. dollar strengthening.","We'd also like to note that we have concluded our restructuring program. We do not expect to have any further structuring expenses in 2017. And as a result, there is no separate guidance on a non-GAAP basis since we will not have any non-GAAP EPS for the year. That guidance reflects growth of 16% to 18% compared to 2016 GAAP diluted EPS, and 8% to 10% compared to 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS.","As always, the 2017 diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions, if any. And as I said earlier, guidance assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels.","So with that overview, let me turn it back over to Stanley.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my remarks with a few highlights of what we believe was a successful, actually, we believe quite a successful 2016. We achieved net sales of $11.6 billion in 2016, up 8.9% from the prior year. Internal sales in local currencies grew by 6.7% when you exclude the estimated impact of the extra week.","Diluted EPS growth was 8.8% on a GAAP basis or a 10.9% growth on a non-GAAP basis. Operating cash flow for the year was $615.5 million and exceeded GAAP net income by more than $108 million.","We announced seven strategic acquisitions in 2016 with a total investment of approximately $229 million as we continue to expand our geographic presence and enhance our product offering. These acquisitions has combined trailing 12-month revenue of approximately $270 million.","The acquisition included dental market expansion into Poland, Japan, and Canada where we're already very strong, as well as an expanded presence in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and the Netherlands for our practice management solutions offerings. To sum it up, we believe that 2016 was quite a solid year.","Now, let me review our full business group starting with Dental. We believe the North American dental consumable merchandise market is improving as we saw particularly strong growth in December and January. We also continued to see increased capital equipment investment in dental practices, which drove strong U.S. and, actually, North American equipment sales in December. January is typically not a strong month for equipment sales, following year-end tax incentives here in the United States, such as Section 179.","On the whole, we believe we continue to gain market share in our Global Dental business. We're looking forward to the biennial International Dental Show, known as the IDS, in Germany next month, as we expect the continued promotion of digital workflows for general dentistry as well as for dental specialties including implant dentists, orthodontists, and those performing endodontic treatments. We believe practices and laboratories will benefit from the introduction of a broad array of digital products and, in particular, enhanced scanner solutions and lower priced milling machines.","As many of you may know, digital dentistry is a top priority of our strategic plan for both North America and internationally. We continue to experience robust sales in our digital scanner solutions in North America, in line with our focus on open architecture. In addition, we offer full chairside systems and, over time, we will seek to broaden the options we offer to dental practices to support product innovation and the proliferation of this important technology. We believe we are well-positioned as market adoption continues to evolve.","Strategic acquisitions remain a cornerstone of our business. We recently announced the acquisition of a company by the name Southern Anesthesia + Surgical or SAS. SAS is a highly regarded provider of surgical supplies and pharmaceuticals to approximately 11,500 oral surgeons, dental anesthesiologists and periodontists across the U.S. as well as those GPs undertaking specialty procedures. They had last \u2013 for the year 2016 about $72 million in sales. SAS enjoys loyal longstanding customer relationships with oral surgery practices in the U.S. In bringing together SAS in our Ace Surgical Supply business \u2013 two well-known and respected brands \u2013 we'll offer the market a broad array of products focused on the unique needs of dental surgeons.","In mid-January, we announced that we completed the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in Dental Cremer, a distributor of dental supplies and equipment in Brazil. Dental Cremer had last year, the full 2016 net sales of approximately US$145 million and serves nearly 90,000 dental practitioners in Brazil.","You may recall that we first entered the Brazilian market in 2014 with our investment in the Dental Speed Graph. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the market growth in Brazil in dentistry, which actually is growing quite nicely. That is fueled by a growing middle-class and aging population at the same time. We are pleased to welcome Dental Cremer to team Schein as we build scale in this important emerging market.","Now, to Animal Health for a bit. Overall, the global animal health market is healthy and is growing, particularly in the companion animal segment where we have expanded opportunities to deliver value-added solutions, and we believe that we continued to gain market share during the fourth quarter.","Today, we are well-positioned to leverage attractive opportunities in these animal health markets. And in the companion segment, we are focused on providing greater selection of high margin products, much as we do in the dental and medical markets. While these markets are competitive, our strategy is deliver high quality solutions and support at price points that fairly reflect the value we provide. We believe our customers value the products and services we offer including our robust and differentiated software platforms, all of which facilitates the delivery of high quality care to the animal health market.","We recently attended the North American Veterinary Conference in Orlando where we launched a new Samsung-branded diagnostic chemistry instrument with bidirectional functionality, the full body digital radiography solution from Cannon, and our new Sparkline software dashboard, which integrates our practice management software to identify key performance metrics, such as revenue growth and customer retention. These additions and advancements continue to build on our solutions-based products and services that enable our customers to grow and run, actually, operate a more profitable practice.","We remain highly optimistic about our opportunities in the practice solutions area in the Animal Health space and including the offering of diagnostic equipment and the related connectivity to our software. It, of course, took us a little time to get our offering together as we relied on a particular manufacturer in the past, but have gained excellent momentum and are very, very excited about offering a wide \u2013 a variety of options to the animal health practitioners who really do appreciate our expanded offerings, not only in the U.S., but globally.","Before we move on to Medical, I would like to highlight our recent announcement of a 51% investment in Tecnew, a leading distributor of animal health products in the state of Rio De Janeiro in Brazil. Tecnew serves nearly 5,000 animal health customers and had 2016 sales of approximately $24 million. This acquisition marks Henry Schein's interest into the animal health distribution market in South America. We look forward to building on the strong reputation that Tecnew enjoys today in Brazil as well as on the experience that we've gained through our entry into the Brazilian market on the dental side a couple of years ago as discussed earlier on.","Now, the Medical. Medical sales growth was 5.6% in the fourth quarter excluding influenza vaccine sales, as well as the estimated impact of the extra week. While this quarterly growth rate has moderated from prior growth rates as we indicated it would, we believe it reflects solid market share gains and, in particular, among large group practices including the IDN networks, the integrated delivery networks.","We believe the medical markets we serve remain healthy despite considerable industry speculation about the potential changes to the healthcare coverage in the U.S. under the new administration. We believe any healthcare reform will broadly preserve a commitment to enabling access to health insurance for Americans. The debate is largely about who pays for it and the administration opted (31:36) access to care.","While there's still uncertainty, we do not expect to see a significant decline in the number of covered lives associated with coverage changes as it relates to visiting a primary care physician in the ultimate care, in the non-acute care market. In addition, we believe that over time, the trend towards treatment in the ultimate care setting will continue as will the emphasis on wellness and prevention. This is directly associated with primary care physician visits, which is that large part of our Medical business. This positions us well as our focus is on serving these core medical customers.","I would like to highlight a recent addition to our executive management team with Bridget Ross who has joined us in the role of President of our Global Medical Group. Bridget was previously at Johnson & Johnson where she spent more than 28 years in sales, marketing, general management activities, overseeing innovations in medical device solutions. At Henry Schein, Bridget will be responsible for the overall leadership of our Global Medical Group.","We have focused primarily over the last half a dozen years on the domestic market in the ultimate care physician space. And with Bridget joining us, we are hopeful now and expect to expand our global presence and add specialty areas in a similar manner to the way we have grown in the Dental and the Animal Health space. But our priority was to focus on IDN business, large group practices in the medical arena domestically. We will still, of course, focus on this area. But we felt that there is a large opportunity to follow the same strategies we followed in our Animal Health and Dental businesses of expanding globally and, at the same time, adding specialty components to our offering.","Bridget will be part of Karen Prange's team. Karen is our Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of our Global Animal Health, Medical and Dental Surgical Groups \u2013 another executive who joined Henry Schein in May of last year.","Bridget will be supported by seasoned, highly capable team on the Medical side in the U.S. The sales and marketing operations of that team led by President, Brad Connett, who has done an outstanding job for Henry Schein for well over two decades and will include an international team. Brad and the Medical team in the U.S. plus our international team on the medical side, have helped drive our success in this important market over many years.","This is indeed a period of transformational change and consolidation in the global medical industry and Henry Schein is committed to helping lead customers through this transformation. We believe we do have the unique capabilities that enable us to be of tremendous value, provide tremendous value to those medical practitioners practicing in the ultimate care market and for those kinds of facilities that work in the primary care and specialty areas outside of the acute care area, outside of the drugstore and the long-term care markets.","As market, technological, and demographic forces converge to create a unique business opportunity for Henry Schein, we are indeed delighted that Bridget has come onboard to help us to make the most of these opportunities.","So, let me conclude with my business overview of Technology and Value-Added Services, which also had a solid quarter with high single-digit internal growth in local currencies. Enhancing digital platforms for the whole of our growing customer base is an important priority for Henry Schein. The core of our software solutions across various platforms seeks to better connect customers with their patients and improve overall practice efficiency. The dual commitment reinforces our value through their practices. As part of our strategic plan, we'll continue to develop and acquire innovative solutions to drive interoperability with devices, as well as the cloud in order to efficiently manage the clinical workflows in our customers' offices.","These are indeed exciting times and Henry Schein remains well-positioned to advance our customers' needs as they seek to automate their practices and take full advantage of the digital economy that has rapidly emerged and will, in fact, advance even further in the next few years.","While we have an excellent footprint with our practice management solutions in North America for dental and animal health markets, we believe there remains significant opportunity for us to expand our technology platforms in other markets and geographies where we have more limited presence. Through our business development efforts, we'll continue on expanding our technology presence globally and continually seek to evolve our cloud-based systems to better integrate our solutions for expanding practices and enterprises.","Before we take your questions, I would like to highlight a few awards and recognitions Henry Schein has received during the fourth quarter. First, Henry Schein was named the Best Animal Health [Healthcare] Product Provider for 2016 by Global Health & Pharma Magazine, a UK-based healthcare publication. This was the inaugural animal health award, the awards were created to recognize companies that promote health and welfare of animals and focus on companies that explore innovation, technology, scientific achievements, and wildlife conservation.","We are honored to have been recognized for our commitment to serve the needs of those who safeguard animal health around the world. Additionally, we were honored to be chosen among the top performers in the Health Care Technology & Distribution as part of Institutional Investor's 2017 surveys for All-American Executive Team.","The awards in the CEO, CFO, and IRR program categories speak to our commitment to open communication and transparency with our investors, as well as our commitment to driving business execution and delivering value to our shareholders.","So, there's a lot that's happening at Henry Schein, very pleased with the performance last year given the challenges we experienced in the Dental side in the early part of summer last year, and the foreign exchange challenges we experienced. But overall, the net bottom line was quite good. We are well-positioned to have, again, a good 2017. Our management team remains excited. The morale in the company's 21,000 team Schein members around the world remains high and we are excited about the future.","So, we have some time for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question come from the line of Jon Block from Stifel.","Ethan Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. This is Ethan on for Jon. Going to be a quick question and then follow-up. A lot of focus has been on the North American dental market recently, but I'm hoping you can comment on what you're seeing in the international consumable side. You grew 2.5% in 4Q and the growth has been about in the 2% to 3% range for the past few years. How does that 2% to 3% compare with the underlying market and what is the right long-term growth rate you'd expect from international dental consumables?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure. I would say similar comments internationally. Markets are stable, they're consistently growing. Historically, we've always seen the international markets grow a little bit slower than the U.S. market. They're a little bit more comparable at the current time. We absolutely believe we're gaining market share in international dental. So, I would say that steady-as-she-goes and I think that the consistency in the market should continue going forward.","Now, of course, that the consumable comment, you know we do have lumpiness related to equipment and the IDS show that we talked about. So, IDS, typically people delay purchases in this current quarter to see new models and new show specials for equipment later in the quarter and that turns into sales in Q2 and Q3. So, we'll see some lumpiness there on international dental equipment sales.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","We remain quite optimistic with our international business. I think to reiterate what Steven said, if you leave aside the lumpiness on European, and particularly Germans \u2013 German and the DACH region sales, I think we're expecting a decent year in both international merchandise and equipment.","Ethan Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then Steven, you kept the guidance range unchanged. Would it be fair to say that the buyback in 4Q may have given you a few cents benefit relative to when you initially guided, but this was largely offset by some incremental FX headwinds since the November guidance?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's exactly right. We weren't expecting to buy back as much as we bought back. In hindsight, it turns out to be even a good \u2013 a very good short-term decision. But longer term, we expect it to be even a better decision because we do have high confidence in the business. The foreign exchange has been a headwind. It has been a headwind for 2016. It's still a headwind for 2017. And because of the unpredictability of foreign exchange, those two kind of counteract each other.","Ethan Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Valiquette with Bank of America.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Stan and Steve. So, I guess for \u2013 just kind of looking at the strength you mentioned in the December and January dental consumable, that's obviously encouraging. Just curious if there's any more color on that, whether you can break that down into DSOs as well as individual practitioners or maybe more on one side versus the other? Or is it just really across the board? Just curious for more color on the trends you're seeing there. Thanks.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. So, I would say there's no significant variance that I've seen between large DSOs and middle market. It seems to be more across the board, although we personally are seeing stronger growth in our middle market. That's an area that we have keen focus on. But I think the overall market is relatively consistent.","As you know, Steve, we've seen periods of time, so we're optimistic where December and January will continue, but there's no certainty in that. We've seen times where \u2013 again, lumpiness in sales. But right now, things seem to be pointing to a slight acceleration in the U.S. dental market. And remember just one other thing, Steve...","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. That's great.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","...that's consumable comment. Equipment, on the other hand, because of the strong December that we had and because of Section 179, which typically pulls sales forward from Q1 into Q4, you have to expect that Q1, you'll see lighter equipment sales because of that tax benefit that pulled forward. And that's a bit of a timing thing that should occur each year now going forward given that the Section 179 is now permanent.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones here. So, Steve, I guess, as you're starting to see these December and January improvements in the North American consumables side, anything now you can look backwards and say, the change seems to be coming here and maybe the slowdown from June through November, anyway, was caused by something. Any better ideas or thoughts on what caused the slowdown to begin with?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","We're still a little bit perplexed as to why it occurred. And Stanley, actually, I think, in his comments said something similar to that. There's really no additional data points that we've seen that give us any greater clarity as to why it happened. We just know it did. And again, hopefully, the long-term prospects of the dental market will continue to be favorable. The demographics are still on our favor, people taking better care of their oral healthcare, aging population, all of that. So, I wish, Jeff, I had a better answer but we really don't have more clarity on that.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. No. Understood. And I apologize, I've been jumping between calls here so, I might have missed Stanley's comments. But Stanley, just on the Medical side \u2013 and I'm going to show my age here \u2013 but I think about 10 years ago or so, you guys kind of dipped your toe into some specialty areas. I don't remember why oncology and dermatology ring a bell, but maybe it was other areas. But then you saw that there was a big pharma component, some other things that you didn't like as much maybe and kind of got out of those areas. It sounds like now kind of going down the specialty route again in Medical. So, can you compare and contrast maybe what you learned a decade ago in that and how this time it might be different?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah. That's a good question. So, the two areas we exited were low margin cancer oncological pharmaceuticals. That's more in line with what the big pharma or the big drug wholesalers do. They deal with high volume products, lower margins than what we do. There's not much we could have added to those kinds of practices through our field sales consulting methodology. Likewise, we exited the specialty pharma area, again, a low margin part of the pharma business.","The areas we have been doing well in are areas such as dermatology, also quite a bit of a private practice arena, the aesthetics area, the obstetrics and gynecology area, the areas that have of course pharmaceuticals, but have a nice componentry from our point of view of disposables and equipment, and those are the areas we will focus on. I don't want to give you an impression that we were not focused on those areas because, actually, they have contributed nicely to our growth over the last six years or so, and have been quite profitable. But we anticipate advancing our investment in those areas in the years to come, in particular into devices rather than low margin pharmaceuticals.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Stan, just going back to your comments on the dental equipment business, you talked about broadening the offering here and, obviously, there's the change coming with how Cerner will be distributed in the U.S. At this point, have you guys seen this have any impact at the practice level? I'm just wondering if maybe we could see some dentists either delaying decision-making or maybe your sales force doesn't push as hard if they're expecting to have a broader offering to sell later this year.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well, that's a good question. I don't know whether we will carry one particular manufacturer's product or another, whether we will expand, whether we'll not. What I do know is that there is a desire to acquire more digital equipment in the office, both in terms of digital imaging and digital prosthetics, chairside, and also I might add on the digital prosthetics in the lab arena.","We have an extensive offering of equipment in the digital imaging space and the digital prosthetics space. So, we are well-positioned and had been well-positioned to grow our market share as we have executed well in these areas, and have also executed well in these areas.","So, I don't think we're as much dependent on a particular product. We would like to have as wide offering as possible, but we are committed to open architecture and have done well with the offerings that we actually have, whether it has been in the digital space or, I might add, in the traditional operatory, the chairs, the units, the lights, the compressors, et cetera.","So, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to grow our market share. I don't believe there has been any holdback. I think we had a very good fourth quarter. I might just remind you that in the fourth quarter of \u2013 in the first quarter of 2016, we did have exceptional equipment growth, I think the number was something like 13.5%. So, you need to take that into account when you look at the first quarter of 2017. It's not going to be possible I think to have those kinds of double-digit growth, and I'm talking about the North American market.","But having said that and excluding the quarterly lumpiness, I think we are well-positioned with our offering, not dependent on any one manufacturer and, indeed, I think we would like to carry all lines to the extent that manufacturers would like to work with us but we are committed to open architecture.","Let me remind you that we did exceptionally well in growing our market share on the equipment side in the United States without having the number one market share product in units, chairs, and lights. We added that product offering and did well. But I don't think our sales people held back any equipment sales anticipating us, at some point, taking on the number one player in the chair, units, and lights.","So, bottom line, long answer, we have a great offering. We have a great sales marketing service group on the equipment side. We are well-positioned. But, of course, we do want to have as wide product offering as possible, but we need to respect the notion that we are open architecture and we'll sell everyone's product. We are a fiercely competitive company and we'll fight for every dollar of sales using the products that we have in our bag and we have done well with that philosophy for decades.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for that. And Steve, if I could just ask a quick follow-up on operating margins. Just wanted to see if the 53rd week had any impact on operating margin for the quarter. And then as we think about margins for next year, would you expect sort of that same-store margin target that you have of about 20 basis points? I mean, is that right in terms of the way we should think about the potential for margin improvement next year? Just looking for a better understanding of the different swing factors as we think about the model.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, you're correct in \u2013 for Q4, the extra week was a little bit negative. I haven't calculated the exact amount, but was a little bit negative to overall Q4 operating margins. Again, the main reason is it's a light week for sales. And with two-thirds of our expenses being compensation and compensation-related, you get a full week of compensation. So, margins were a little bit lower there.","On full year 2017, yes, our guidance does assume at least 20 basis points of operating margin expansion and it's correct to note that's on what we like to call same-store basis, meaning it excludes the impact, if any, of any acquisitions that could be positive or negative to that number. But we do believe that there's still room for margin expansion going forward.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. You guys talked about the strong growth in the U.S. dental consumables in December and January. Did you also see that momentum continue into February? And then, can you remind us what you factored into your 2017 guidance? Are you assuming an ongoing recovery in U.S. dental consumables market? Just trying to understand the degree to which you've built some conservatism into the guidance?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Sure. We'll start with the last part first. The 2017 guidance really only assumed a very modest improvement in end market conditions, not just for Dental, but for all of our markets. So, it was more consistent, but with some slight improvement.","February, we didn't comment on because when you start segmenting months and looking at it in a particular week-by-week basis, you really couldn't get misleading results. But we don't think \u2013 we wouldn't have said December and January unless we believed that there was potential for it to continue. But looking at the specific weeks, it's too short a period to really draw conclusions from.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape in Dental, especially as it relates to large versus smaller customers. Have you seen any changes in the competitive dynamics in either of those segments recently?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","This is probably the most asked question from analysts other than how's the market doing. And I just want to reemphasize what we've been saying for years, the dental market is competitive. It's a market that is driven by a combination of price and service offered. In other words, value. I don't think anything has changed.","We have a good market share in the large practices. We have, we believe, the most outstanding offering with tremendous experience in that area. And, yes, every now and again, a competitor will go in with prices below ours and we will not match those prices because we believe our offering is of high value and we cannot and will not dilute the value that is ascribed to our offering.","So, I would be understanding that Henry Schein is competitive in the space \u2013 highly competitive in the space, has always been competitive. There has always been competition. The competition hasn't increased at all, it's the same competition we've had for decades. Sometimes words are said, sometimes there are announcements about a particular account won. Henry Schein does not announce each one of our accounts that we win. We don't discuss our strategy precisely. We talk to our customers about that, and that's our job.","Our job is to provide value to our customers. I believe we continue to do a good job in that area, and there is no more competition today than there was 10 years ago. The competition wants our business and we want our competition's business. It's a fiercely competitive market. Henry Schein will continue to provide great value to our customers, and we will continue to increase the value-added that we deliver to our customers each day.","So, it's a pretty stable market, highly competitive as it has always been, and there's no time at all to sit back and relax \u2013 there never has been a time to sit back and relax. And we are committed to growing our market share in all areas in the industry. We have a good track record in that regard, and we anticipate that, that track record will continue.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. I appreciate the comments.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. And the question is from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS.","Allen Lutz - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. This is Allen in for Mike. Thanks for taking the question. In the Medical segment, can you talk about what is driving the share gains in large group practices? Are you still seeing the benefit from the agreement with Cardinal or is there something else happening there?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","So, I'm not sure how share gains have ever had anything to do with any particular supplier relationship. Yes, we did acquire a book of business from Cardinal. That was a one-time step-up as result of that acquisition, excluded from internal growth numbers. And we have been executing for the past, I think it's now seven years on a strategy to gain market share amongst large group practices. It was about increasing our capabilities through both additional management and focus and through additional value-added services, very similar, I might add to what we did in the Dental arena when we started our special markets group 21 years ago.","So, it's about focus. It's about management. And it's about the value-added services and, actually, the product offering. That has resulted in our market share growth in the space. We do well, we are well-positioned, and we anticipate doing well, but I would not say that it's because of any one supplier. We have a very good supplier relationship with Cardinal today, they're very helpful. But they also supply our competitors with products. So, I don't think it's any one way or another related to any specific manufacturer.","Allen Lutz - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","Robin?","Operator","And you have any closing remarks?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. Yes. Let me \u2013 thank you, Robin. Thank you, Carolynne, and Steven, and everyone, for calling in. Again, we are very excited about where we are at Henry Schein, our plans for the future, our four major business units, each one have great business plans for this year: our Global Dental Group; our Global Animal Health Group; our Global Medical; and of course, our practice solutions, and financial services, our Value-Added Services group.","We are in the process of looking on our 2018, 2019, and 2020 strategic plan. I don't expect any major directional change. I do expect additional focus in certain areas, a movement of resources, but this was all anticipated through the restructuring we went through at the end of 2015 and through 2016.","So, as I said right at the beginning of the remarks, our management team is excited, the morale in the company is great, and we have so many opportunities to expand the business both through internal growth and through acquisition growth. Obviously, acquisitions happen when they happen, they are lumpy. But our pipeline remains decent and we anticipate advancing on the acquisition side without any commitment as for specific dates, for any specific amounts of capital.","We will use our capital as we have now for quite a while to continue to buy back some shares, make some acquisitions and, of course, invest in the business. We are well capitalized. We have cash that we need to execute and, again, very excited about the future.","So, thank you for calling in, and we'll be back in about 60 days after I think \u2013 at which time, we'll be able to report on the Chicago Midwinter Meeting, the IDS Meeting will have just occurred. And likewise, I think we'll be able to give you a better temperature on the animal health market and on our Medical business. So, thank you very much.","If you have, by the way, any questions, please feel free to call Carolynne Borders in our Investor Relations Department at 631-390-8105.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders. Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Bettina, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the third quarter of 2016. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements.","As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including growth rates and market share, are based on the company's internal analysis and estimates.","The contents of this conference call contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 2, 2016.

This will provide the opportunity for as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour we have allotted.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report record financial results for the third quarter. We believe we gained market share in each of our business groups, as the company continues to be well served by our diversified portfolio and an expanding global customer base. Today, we are affirming guidance for 2016 GAAP diluted EPS growth of 7% to 8% or 10% to 11% on an adjusted non-GPA (sic) [non-GAAP] basis. We are also pleased to introduce guidance for 2017 diluted EPS that represents growth of 17% to 19% on a GAAP basis or growth on a 9% to 11% basis on an adjusted non-GPA (sic) [non-GAAP] basis. Both compared with respective midpoints of 2016 guidance.","In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. But to set the tone, we remain very pleased with the state of the company, with our continued market share growth throughout the world, and believe we are operating in very good markets.","So, Steven, please provide your financial report.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pre-tax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pre-tax or $0.08 per diluted share. Also, our prior year third quarter results include a one-time income tax benefit net of controlling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable tax ruling.","I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, which excludes the restructuring costs and the prior year tax benefit, as we believe the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling comparison of financial results between prior periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes, and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see in Exhibit B of this morning's earnings release a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.","So first, turning to our sales results, our net sales for the quarter ended September 24, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 6.7% increase compared with the prior year's third quarter and this consists of 7.7% growth in constant currency and a 1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.0%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%. When further normalizing our results for switches between agency sales and direct sales, that internal sales growth in local currencies for Q3 was 5.6%. You can see the details of sales growth in Exhibit A of today's earnings release.","The operating margin on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2016 was 7.0%, and that was a contraction of 3 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2015. There are three key items that negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 17 basis points. The first item relates to acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and the related expenses for those acquisitions as well as the switches between agency sales and direct sales. They combined negatively impacted the contraction by 14 basis points.","Second, flu vaccine sales this year had a lower margin compared to the prior year, and that negatively impacted our operating margin by 15 basis points. This was offset by the third item that was related to a decrease in restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, and that favorably impacted the contraction by 12 basis points. So, when you net out those three items, the net impact of these items, our operating margin on a non-GAAP basis expanded by 14 basis points.","If you look at our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 28.9%. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, it was slightly slower at 28.7%. This compares with an adjusted non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29.6% for the third quarter. As you'll recall, we had a favorable tax audit that we discussed last quarter that allowed us to reduce our overall ongoing effective tax rate, and we expect next quarter the effective tax rate, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, to be in the same 28% range that we're showing this quarter.","Net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis was $133.7 million or $1.63 per diluted share, representing increases of 4.7% and 7.2%, respectively, both compared with last year. Excluding restructuring costs, adjusted non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter was $137.7 million or $1.68 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively, compared with last year, also on a non-GAAP basis.","I think it's important to point out that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.01, and that was offset by share repurchases, which benefited by about the same approximate $0.01, so they kind of netted each other out.","Let me provide some additional details on sales by business group. Dental sales for the third quarter of 2016 increased 5.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 5.6% growth in local currencies and a 0.5% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%.","Looking at North America, the North American internal growth in local currencies was 4.4%, and that included 1.8% growth in sale of dental consumable merchandise products and 13.3% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenues. I'd like to point out that the dental equipment revenue benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales from Q4 into Q3, and that was associated, in part, with some promotional activities that occurred in the third quarter.","I'd also like to reiterate that our growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals that we discussed last quarter. This decision negatively impacted our North American dental merchandise sales during the current quarter by approximately 50 basis points. And that'll continue to impact our merchandise sales growth for the next two quarters until fully annualized. Our annual sales of precious metals in the prior year was approximately $14 million, and again that won't reoccur in 2016 or going forward.","International internal growth in local currencies of our Dental group was 3.1% and included 2.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 4.2% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. On an overall basis, we believe we outpaced the global dental market for the current quarter, and we believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remain strong.","Turning to Animal Health, our Animal Health sales were $790.3 million for the third quarter; that's an increase of 7.9%. The components include growth of 10.6% in constant currencies and 2.7% decline related to foreign currency. Internal sales in local currencies grew 8.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 2.0% to our growth. That 8.6% internal growth in constant currencies consisted of 10.0% growth in North America and 7.2% growth internationally.","The normalized impact of Animal Health results, which again accounts for the switching of products from agency to direct sales, that 8.6% internal growth in local currencies reflects a 6.9% growth including 6.6% in North America. Again, this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. We believe these were solid results, and we believe we continue to gain market share both domestically and overseas in Animal Health.","Turning to Medical, Medical sales were $639.6 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.1%, which is all internally generated. There's no material impact of sales growth related to foreign currency for this business, and the components of that 7.1% included growth of 7.4% in North America and a slight decline of 0.9% internationally. Again, we're pleased with the Medical growth and we believe we gained market share also in the medical market.","Last, turning to Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $104.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. That included 18.3% growth in constant currencies and a 1.6% decline related to foreign currency. The components of that constant currency internal growth was internally generated sales increase of 7.6%, and acquisition growth was an additional 10.7%. And that 7.6% growth globally included 7.0% growth in North America and 10.8% growth internationally.","I'd like to point out that the North American sales were highlighted by growth of more than 11% in our financial services businesses. These businesses include equipment and practice financing, credit card practicing, practice brokerage, patient collections, and other services. Internationally, the Technology sales growth was driven primarily by increased software services.","During the quarter, we continued to repurchase common stock in the open market. Specifically we repurchased 1.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $163.62, and that is approximately $193 million. As I said earlier, the impact of the repurchase of shares on our third quarter EPS was about $0.01 favorable. Our share repurchase program demonstrates our long-term commitment to create further value for shareholders and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of our business. In line with this, we increased share repurchases in the third quarter at a greater rate than prior quarters.","Also, on October 19 of 2016, we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of an additional $400 million of shares of the company's common stock. That's in addition to the program that was announced in December of 2015, and we have completed the purchase of that December 2015 repurchase program. Again, we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value.","If we look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $178.1 million, that compares to $107.4 million last year. And, again, we believe that strong cash flow will continue for the balance of the year. Our DSO, or day sales outstanding, in accounts receivable was up slightly to 42.4 days for the current quarter versus 40.6 days last year. And inventory turns, the other key metric, was 5.6 turns, and that's relatively unchanged from last year, which was 5.7 turns.","Let me conclude my remarks by discussing both our 2016 and 2017 financial guidance. For 2016, we expect GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $6.11 to $6.16 that represents growth of 7% to 8% compared with the GAAP diluted EPS of $5.69 for 2015. Adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS, excluding the restructuring costs ranging from $0.42 to $0.46 per diluted share, is expected to be $6.55 to $6.60 for 2016, and that represents growth of 10% to 11% compared to the adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.96 for 2015.","I'd also like to note that a significant portion of our EPS in the current quarter, in excess of the consensus estimates for the current quarter, was impacted by favorable timing versus the fourth quarter. The 2016 guidance assumes Q4 adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS in the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range or in the high-single-digit range on a GAAP basis. Guidance for 2016 GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact for potential future acquisitions, if any, or any restructuring costs.","Henry Schein expects that the current restructuring activities to be completed this year in the fourth quarter. We expect restructuring costs in Q4 2016 to be $17 million to $22 million pre-tax or $0.15 to $0.19 per diluted share. I'll also point out that 2016 guidance assumes foreign exchange rates that are generally consistent with the current levels. However, we believe that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen especially against the British pound. And remember that about 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.","I'll also just remind people that our results this year are on a 52\/53 week basis, ending on the last Saturday of December. So fiscal 2016 consists of 53 weeks. This extra week is in the last week of Q4 2016. And obviously, since that's a holiday week at the end of the year, between Christmas and New Year's, sales are generally lower during that week and we anticipate that the extra week will not materially add to our earnings since fixed expenses remain relatively constant. When we report Q4 results, we'll also provide information on the sales impact of that extra week.","Turning to next year, we're introducing 2017 financial guidance as follows. GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $7.17 to $7.30 for 2017. Since we do not expect to incur any restructuring costs in 2017, there is no separate non-GAAP guidance. The GAAP guidance will be the only guidance that we're reporting, and this guidance reflects 17% to 19% on a GAAP basis compared to the prior year and 9% to 11% on a non-GAAP basis when using the non-GAAP numbers for the prior year and the midpoint of those non-GAAP numbers.","Similarly to the 2016 guidance, the 2017 guidance is for current operations, does not include any previously-announced acquisitions or the potential impact of future acquisitions. And again, I'll point out that we assume foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels.","So with that quick summary, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our four business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter three was relatively consistent with the quarter two growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well in the third quarter with particular strength in the implant sales worldwide. While the dental consumable merchandise market continued to reflect somewhat slower than historic growth, it appears to be stable. Though not back to levels we saw a couple of quarters ago, we believe that the soft U.S. dental market is more temporary as September sales growth accelerated, although October was somewhat soft. We believe that October sales growth was negatively impacted by the weather in certain areas of the country. I would note that we have demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable EPS growth even during soft market conditions.","North American dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies is 13.3% during the quarter, while, shall I say, sales of high-tech equipment with strong CAD\/CAM and Zahn customer automated prosthetic product sales experienced double-digit year-over-year internal growth in local currencies. Note that equipment growth benefited to some extent from an acceleration of sales growth associated in part with the promotion in the quarter. Favorable dental equipment purchases are typically a leading indicator of dental practitioner sentiment. We do believe that the third quarter equipment sales in North America, coupled with the potential benefit from the Section 179 tax incentive, indicate that current market slowness may not prevail over the long term. That said, we are still closely monitoring industry data points as they become available in order to gauge the growth of the dental end market in North America. We would like to see additional future market data to draw any firm conclusion on sales trends.","As we implement initiatives to expand digital dentistry in North America and abroad, we are pleased to report that sales of our digital impression solutions continue to be strong. Year-over-year, quarterly sales once again grew in double digits for our global prosthetic solutions business worldwide. We have an excellent product offering with scanners from PlanScan, 3Shape and 3M in North America, Australia, and New Zealand, supported by a software platform that features all-in-one capabilities and open architecture. This allows dentists to choose the best technology for their practice. In Europe, we are the leading distributor of Sirona dental equipment. We are playing an important role in educating dental practitioners on the benefits of CAD\/CAM technology and integrated digital workflows, and we are well positioned as the market adoption continues to evolve.","As I mentioned, sales of dental specialty products, which include implants, orthodontics and endodontics did well this quarter. In particular, we posted low-double-digit worldwide sales growth with dental implants. Today, we are well positioned to leverage the attractive opportunities in these fast-growing markets with high-margin products. Our dental specialty product offering is highly synergistic with our core Dental business as an increasing number of general practitioners are now performing more specialty procedures themselves, rather than referring them out. It is our goal to capitalize on our relationships with these GPs \u2013 these general practitioners \u2013 and help their practices generate new sources of revenue while providing their customers, their patients, with a great quality of service and clinical value to their patients.","Finally, with respect to our Dental business, during the third quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire an 80% ownership position in Marrodent, one of Poland's largest full service dental distributors with 2015 sales of approximately $32 million. Marrodent marks the company's entry into the Poland dental market, opening opportunities for approximately 20,000 dental offices to do business with us and building upon a presence following our 2014 entry into the animal health market in Poland, which has proven to be most successful for the company. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. We look forward to serving the Polish dental community with the same high standards of commitment to efficiency and success that customers throughout the world have come to expect from Henry Schein, helping our new Polish customers operate a more efficient practice so that they can in the end provide better quality care to their patients.","Now, let me touch briefly on our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results for agency switches, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 6.6% in North America. International sales during the third quarter were up 11% in local currencies, with 7.2% internal growth complemented by our strategic acquisitions, including KRUUSE in Denmark and Vetcorp (26:33) in Australia. We believe the animal markets in the U.S. and abroad are healthy and continue to grow. With our focus on the companion animal segment in the U.S., we see significant opportunities to expand our market share by servicing all the practices' needs of office space veterinarians with products and related services, including our software to address their clinical diagnostic and reference lab requirements.","We do have an excellent portfolio of products and services that is arguably the deepest in the industry. Our practice management and Axis-Q software solutions offer robust clinical integration features to connect with diagnostic systems, capture revenue and help practice operate efficiency. Our goal is to help animal health practitioners operate a more efficient practice so that they too can provide better quality care. We continue to believe we are making good progress in executing on our diagnostic sales strategy and are very pleased also with the performance of our Global Animal Health group.","Let me now turn to our Medical group. We believe our Medical sales growth of 7.1%, all internally generated, was well in excess of the broader market and reflects our ability to increase market share as we capitalize on our exposure to large group practices, including IDNs, the Integrated Delivery Networks. We continue to benefit from trends associated with the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. as there are more covered lives and more procedures moving from the hospital setting to the general practitioner offices. And the office practitioner of course is our primary customer. We believe our Medical businesses can grow at a healthy rate in the high-single digits in a market that is currently growing in the low-single digits, even potentially less.","I'll conclude my business overview with Technology and Value-Added Services. We are pleased with the third quarter performance of these businesses, as we are with our other groups. Internal sales growth in local currencies was 7% in North America and 10.8% in our international business. North American sales were highlighted by growth of over 11% in financial services business, while international growth was primarily driven by software revenue.","Strategic acquisitions contributed growth in local currencies of nearly 18% in North America, including the contribution of Vetstreet, and growth of more than 21% internationally, driven by RxWorks. Our technology offerings are key elements to our total solutions platform at Henry Schein. Technology will be a critical enabler of more efficient, patient-friendly practices. We're investing in the development of products that will help us better service and grow our installed base. Lots of exciting activity going on in the Technology group. Our next generations of solutions will be ready to meet the requirements of faster and easier access to data, the sharing of workflow in the cloud, and streamlined communication with patients. Interoperability with devices will also play a big role here, and really, really doing great work in this part of the business.","So, before we take your questions, I would like to make a few remarks about the future strategic initiatives of the company. We are beginning the process to develop the 2018-2020 strategic plan. In keeping with our focus on providing value-added solutions to our customers, this plan will build on our foundation of delivering high-margin products, software and services that help practitioners drive more successful, more profitable businesses while providing the best in quality care. The combination of practice efficiency and providing quality care are the hallmark of the Henry Schein Value-Added Services offering that will play a key role and be center to our 2018-2020 strategic plan.","So, operator, with those comments, we're ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the North American dental market, particularly the consumables in the quarter, and then also what you're seeing in terms of competitive levels for different segments like large groups or smaller ones. Thank you.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","So thank you for that question. We believe the U.S. dental market continues to be quite stable. In our view, the soft U.S. dental consumable market is more temporary, in our view again, as September sales growth accelerated. Now, just to be clear, we're talking about hundreds of basis points, even less than that, swings. So it is hard to measure this impact on a month-to-month basis. September was strong, October was soft. We believe the October sales growth was negatively impacted by weather in certain areas in the country. When I say soft, I mean relatively soft in terms of basis points. Small numbers of basis points. It is still, in our view, too early to conclude whether the market will experience a more significant rebound. But it's really important to note that our U.S. dental equipment and our specialty product sales were strong during the quarter. By the way, our Canadian business is also strong. So that impacts the North American performance as well. We believe that the U.S. dental equipment positive trends are positive market indicators.","So, overall, the U.S. dental market is solid, probably flat from a unit point of view. Very hard to tell. There are some units that are up in the specialty areas, and there's also some price compression because of, perhaps, competitiveness with one or two product categories. But, overall, the market is solid, and very hard to make concrete long-term decisions on trends based on one week's performance over another. But we believe dentists would not be investing in their practices if they didn't feel good about the practices. By the way, we do continue to feel very good about our global Animal Health business, our U.S. Medical business, our international Dental business. And overall, we do feel very confident that we are gaining market share across all of our portfolios throughout the world. So it's a long answer to a short question.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Perfect. That was very helpful. And then, just in terms of the competitive environment you're seeing in Dental in terms of large group or smaller spaces, do you have any additional comments on that area? Any changes you've been seeing?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well, the dental market has always been a very competitive market. We have been competing strongly with our major competitors and the smaller competitors for decades. I'm not sure the competition has increased substantially. At the end of the day, we believe we have a very strong proposition to offer to our large customers, our midsized customers and our smaller customers. The proposition we offer is based on a margin generation value that enables us to fund the Value-Added Services, which we believe are unique in the market, in particular, our software that we offer, interoperability of that software with various devices, our e-commerce platform. These are all unique.","So, given that array of value-added offering and coupled with the prices that perhaps are being offered from time to time by competitors, we believe we have a very good offering and, more important, do not feel we are in any more of a competitive disadvantage or advantage to the historical trends. Having said that, we do believe that our value-added service offering continues to improve and, therefore, increases the positive gap between us and our competition.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, guys. How are you?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Very good. How are you doing?","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I'm doing well. Thank you. So, Steve, I want to start with you, and then Stanley, I want to come back to a bigger picture question for you as well. But, Steve, just I would assume you guys can cut your data in certain ways. So just on your October comments, I'd be interested to hear kind of what you were seeing in the North American dental consumables market, maybe outside the Southeast where I'm assuming your weather comments are focused, And then I'm just trying to understand what you pulled forward into 3Q. I get it on the promotion side, on the equipment side for the North American dental, but it feels like to me, you may be talking about some other areas as well. So just want to clarify that.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah, on the favorable timing, I'll deal with the first that's easy. There are three factors. One is the North American dental equipment sales, 13% growth in the current quarter, but some of that did pull forward from Q4. The second is favorable timing on influenza vaccine sales. I think, as most people know, we can't control sales between Q3 and Q4. And we just had stronger versus last year \u2013 we had stronger sales growth in the current quarter versus last year's third quarter. And the last is, it's some timing of some expenses. And again, all three of those, we wanted to point out that while it was still a strong quarter, were some favorable timing things that helped Q3 and will reverse in Q4.","On your second question, Jeff, I think you know that starting in June, the market saw and we were unfortunately the first to talk about it on our conference call, the U.S. dental market showed softness. We saw that softness really continue June, July and August at different rates, but not materially different rates. September was a very strong month for us. We were beginning to believe \u2013 during September, and I'm talking about consumable merchandise in the U.S. dental market, specifically, we were beginning to believe that it was really just related to the summer and vacations for practices or patients, but it was very strong. And then, October was not as strong. It was still a bit better than what we saw earlier. But, geographically, you had the hurricane impact that negatively impacted things. You had the ADA trade show that was in a different quarter than last year that negatively impacted. So we still believe that October is potentially an indicator of positive signs, but as Stanley said, we don't have a perfect crystal ball. We would like to see some future data points. Equipment sales we would expect to be strong again because of Section 179 in Q4.","Stanley also highlighted specialty sales to give you a specific on that, specifically on dental implants, and I think everyone knows dental implants typically because they're high-priced products and high-priced procedures and very little insurance coverage, when patients are more conscious of their spend, typically that's something that shows weakness earlier. But again, we had very strong dental implant sales. We had double-digit sales growth globally and even slightly higher than that in the U.S. market. So I think both the equipment and the specialty sales are indicators that the market is stable and has potential, but we're still being cautious (41:18) don't have that perfect crystal ball.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, understood. That's helpful, Steve. Thank you. And then, Stanley, so the bigger picture question for you is you guys have been great at kind of this long-term planning over the years, kind of laying out your three-year plans as you're talking about 2018 to 2020 now, but even the longer term plans than that. So I'd be interested to hear from you just kind of how do you think the next three years to five years in the dental market, how are you going to have to compete differently than maybe you have over the last three years to five years to maybe even ten years. Obviously DSOs have grown to be a bigger part of the North American market. Rumors out there that maybe some other competitors are trying to get into the North American dental consumable side of the market and that. So just how do you think you have to change the way you compete over the next three years to five years?","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff. Good question. I think we have to, of course, add to the Value-Added Services proposition of Henry Schein. We have many business units that are offering different componentry to the dental market whether it's products, specialty products, whether it is value-added services, software, e-commerce, different kinds of services from an education point of view, from a practitioner's point of view, from the relationship with schools. We need to go out into the marketplace much more with a one-stop proposition to our customers, including leveraging our businesses outside of dental, namely medical and to some extent veterinary, because they also are dealing with some of the schools and some of the institutions.","So, what we need to be doing is going out far more with a one-stop value-added service proposition. We are well positioned. I don't believe anyone has the array of services that we have and particularly on a global basis. We need to globalize more of our value-added services, be it in the digital prosthetic field or in the software field. And interoperability will be key. So these are the various areas that we will focus on. Your last sentence about additional competition coming into our markets with large accounts, I think that's what you implied. I don't think anything has changed there. There's been a lot of competition in that space. There will always be competition in that space. More of the business will go into the very large accounts, but more will go into the mid-sized accounts.","And I believe that in our strategic vision for the future, we will focus on separate value-added service propositions for different sectors of the market, the very large, the mid markets and the small. And these will be global propositions because it's the same trend that we're seeing around the world. And our value-added service offerings will be globalized. Yes, they will be customized for specific market needs, but the strategic thinking behind these offerings and the services that we will develop or expand the services that we will develop will be utilizing global resources and global solutions, with some customization for the local needs. So we are very excited about the opportunities we have to further advance our value-added service propositions for specific sectors based on the size of customer and adding to that the various value-added service solutions from a specialty point of view as well.","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","Bettina, we'll take the next...","Operator","Okay. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for all the details so far. So I want to ask a different type of competition question. I know this has been the theme, but it seems like the theme across healthcare. I know you guys have been very much focusing on the value-added services you provide, the strong partnerships. Have you seen a trend of people working or are you trying to use price specifically? It seems like it's coming up in other different healthcare subsectors where that's in the dental market or even animal health and medical where people are trying to use price specifically as the weapon trying to come in and take share.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well, of course, price has always played a role \u2013 a key role. You've got to be competitive. Price has been an issue in our markets for the 36 years that I've been in the business. So, yes, price is important. But you have to balance price with value-added services. It costs money to develop value-added services. It costs money to field a sales force, although both the value-added services and the field force need to be more efficient. We need to have more sales per head and we need to have more sales per dollar invested in value-added services. So the combination of investment in the value-added services and price is what drives competition and the bottom line.","We obviously have to sharpen that as we have done every single year for decades. We have to sharpen at the end of the day the price we charge for the value-added service and the products. Competition has always been there. So I'm not sure if there's anything new in the market other than we have to just continue with what we've done for decades, which is to provide a better proposition to our customers. I'm confident that we are well positioned to do that as we bring together our various offerings into a unified offering for our customer base.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. The fact that nothing's really different I think is the key focal point, so I appreciate the color.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","When I say nothing's different, nothing's different in the market in terms of competition. The dental market, the medical and animal health markets have been fiercely competitive markets for decades, and I don't expect that to change.","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Can I just add one thing, please? Mike, you made reference in your question to other areas of healthcare where there is, my understanding because it's not an area we participate in, but I assume you're referring to pharma wholesaling and over the last couple of weeks or so, there's been a lot of input on very competitive situations. I just want to make sure everyone realizes that's not our market. Sometimes we get painted with a broad brush that we're both in healthcare distribution, but whatever is going on there, and I don't pretend to understand it as well, that is really not what we're seeing in our market. Yes, you have to be competitive, but we still don't believe that you have participants who are doing irrational pricing in order to gain market share. So it's just a different world in our segment of medical and animal health.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Steve, that's very helpful clarification. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Just a quick question for Steve. The inventory levels are down again quarter over quarter sequentially, which is counter to sort of the historical trend in the business. Was that largely tied to Dental, and should we expect that to bounce back in the fourth quarter?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah, well, inventory levels were down. The inventory turns were also relatively consistent year-over-year. And when you look at our inventory levels, there's less inventory carried for equipment, because much of equipment is custom ordered. So we do have certain equipment that, for standard packages, that we'll sell immediately to customers. But many times, customers are not ordering out of inventory. So it's directly related to more the consumable sides. I would say that the better measurement is looking at inventory turns, and that's been consistent. And our goal, quite frankly, is to improve turns over the next year or two. There're still opportunities in the market, from time to time, to do small forward buy-ins. So we take advantage of that where it's financially smart to do so. Typically, we're not buying forward any significant period of time. We're dealing with four to six weeks. So it's very short-term buys. But if the market allows us to get a little bit of advantage doing that, then we'll take advantage of it.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","That's it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the growth rate in North American medical? I think it was 7% in the quarter. What was that ex agency, and how did that compare to the previous quarters? Was that a slight deceleration?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Okay. So there was no agency impact that was material in the current quarter. So it's the same number with or without agency because there was no impact. So, yes, you're correct that it was slightly lower than a comparable number, which I think was high-single digits \u2013 high-single maybe to 10% in the prior quarter. But I don't think there's anything there. It's still very strong sales growth. We're still growing significantly faster than the market and taking market share. And you have to be careful just specifically looking at that closely one quarter to a next, because there are ebbs and flows in winning business that don't perfectly go straight line in every quarter, but we're still very pleased with that 7% growth.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, it looks good. So there's no noticeable impact from, like say, the Affordable Care Act or perhaps some lives coming off of these exchanges, nothing like that? It'll probably pop back up next quarter?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Well -","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","I think these exchanges are not really impacting us directly per se. The number of Americans who now have access to a primary care physician has gone up over the last year or two or three. More people realize that through the Affordable Act, they can access a primary care physician. They understand more and more the value of a primary care physician visit. So that has gone up. We have cautioned, though, on prior calls, that double-digit growth in this market is not realistic. Can't do that forever. So the kind of growth we're experiencing now, a little bit up, little bit down, is where we can continue to grow for a while into the future. Mid-single digits to a little bit higher single digits is, I think, what you can expect. But beyond that, we may have quarters from time to time with a very high rate, but I don't think that is sustainable, and we certainly haven't built our models and our budgets around that.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks and congrats on a good quarter.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","Thank you.","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","We have time for one final question.","Operator","Okay, and your final question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Steve, can you just clarify \u2013 you had strong U.S. dental equipment growth, but you did say some of that was driven by promotions? I think I heard you say you expect it to be strong in the fourth quarter too, but just wanted to make sure, can we expect that number to be a positive number year-over-year in Q4?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah, so, it's not unusual for us to have promotions from time to time. It's part of what we continually do. We had a very successful promotion for equipment sales that ended at the end of Q3, which is also typical. We typically time our promotions to end at the end of a quarter. It's probably more successful than we expected it to be, which is a good thing, I guess. And I guess, John, the thing that we believe will be positive for us is this whole Section 179, where practices can deduct up to $500,000 of CapEx. And we believe that'll drive additional equipment sales growth in Q4, and we've been saying that all year. But quite frankly, it's really hard to estimate with precision how much of that will occur, but I do think that we'll see benefit there and I do think that there'll be a little bit of impact because we did pull forward equipment sales, but we still expect to have a good Q4 in equipment. But the wildcard is how much of the 179 will actually come to help us in Q4.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, that's helpful. So the other question, if you just think about your U.S. business in total, are you seeing any signs that some of the softness that you saw pop up in June in Dental is rolling into Animal Health or Medical?","Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.","Yeah, it doesn't seem like that. It doesn't seem like that at all, which is also another factor why we believe that this U.S. phenomenon may be more temporary. Temporary may not be measured in a month or two. It may be measured in a longer time period. But when you look at Medical and you look at Animal Health, we're really not seeing a similar thing occurring in the U.S. So I think that's a positive indicator, but we're being cautious. While we do expect a little bit of improvement in the U.S. dental market in our guidance, we're not being very aggressive there until we actually see it occur because we can't predict exactly when that temporary piece will rebound. And again, we're still expecting it to rebound, but we have to actually see it happen.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks so much.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","John, just to add to Steven's comment, I think it is reasonable to expect mid percentage growth \u2013 single-digit growth in our Animal Health and our Medical businesses. Yes, we've had quarters where that number has been higher. I'm talking about an internal growth adjusting for agency switches in the Animal Health space, but I think mid-single percentage growth is reasonable in Animal Health and Medical. Again, we've had higher, but we have to build our models based on that. Some growth in Dental and that I think is the way we need to project the future rather than build it based on \u2013 build our future based on some of the spikes we've had on the higher side from time to time.","Again, we are very comfortable with our businesses. We expect to grow market share across the board in each of our businesses in the major sections of consumables, equipment, value-added services in the case of Animal Health in both the pharmaceutical side and the consumables side, the disposable side, diagnostics. And so I think we're well positioned in the entire company to continue to grow market share across the board. We have a great management team. We're adding to the management team in a couple of areas where we have, where we feel that there's greater opportunity to grow into newer areas or areas that may be of the newer parts of the economy from our point of view and are very, very excited about the company. The morale is good and overall I think we're well positioned to develop our 2018-2019-2020 strategic plan. We have a clear understanding of what's going to be in there. It's a question of fine-tuning. And we're very, very excited about the future.","Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.","So with that in mind, everyone, thank you for calling in and we look forward to being on the phone with you, I think, in this time it's 120 days, right? Because it's in February. So if you have any questions, please feel free to call Carolynne Borders at...","Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.","631-390-8105.","Stanley M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, Holly, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2019 second quarter. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company\u2019s business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company\u2019s performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end-market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company\u2019s internal analysis and estimates.","Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in our operating of our business.","These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the supplemental info section of our Investor Relations website.","The content of this call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 6, 2019. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.","Please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up during Q&A to allow us with many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour that we have allotted for this call.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by highlighting our solid earnings performance for the second quarter as we delivered 8.3% year-over-year growth in GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations and 10.5% growth on a non-GAAP basis.","Now that our 2019 restructuring initiative is complete, we're providing guidance for 2019 GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations including those restructuring costs. We are also affirming our prior guidance range for 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations all of which Steven will discuss in greater detail.","While second quarter topline results reflect some softness in the North American dental sales, this was offset by solid growth in dental sales in the DACH region, dental specialty sales and medical sales. Although, we believe second quarter grow in the U.S. Dental end market was slower than in recent quarters, we note that the market growth rates in any particular quarter may vary and we had a difficult comparable in the prior year.","In other words, I think it is important to take into account the 2018 growth for the quarter versus the 2019 growth for the quarter and make sure that that is understood. We reaffirm our belief that the global Dental and Medical markets remain generally stable and that we are well positioned to continue to grow our presence in the end markets we serve. We've had a track record of growing market share in the markets that we serve and we're confident that we can continue to grow our market share in the years to come.","As you know, we have multiple initiatives underway at Henry Schein, aimed at positioning the company for long-term growth. This includes promoting higher-margin products and services. We continue to make good progress with the expansion of our product portfolio, with new internally developed solutions and others through acquisitions. We are well focused on optimizing our infrastructure, as we position Henry Schein for continued growth in the global Dental and Medical markets. So we remain optimistic about the future.","At this time, I'll hand the call over to Steven to review our financial results and guidance and then I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. Steven?","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q2 2019 and Q2 2018 non-GAAP results exclude certain costs that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Please note that as we did last quarter, we have included a corporate sales category for Q2 that represents product sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreements entered into in connection with the Animal Health spin-off that was completed in February of 2019. We expect these sales to Covetrus to continue into the first half of 2020. These are low-margin sales that have a negligible impact on our operating income. For 2019, we expect these corporate sales to total approximately $100 million.","Turning now to our Q2 results. Net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 29, 2019, were $2.4 billion, reflecting a 5.7% increase compared with the second quarter of 2018, with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 3.5%. When excluding those product sales to Covetrus under the TSA, internal sales growth in local currencies was 2.4%. The details of our sales growth are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued today.","On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 6.6% and declined about 15 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring costs, our operating margin was 7.1% and essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. Again you can find a reconciliation of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income in the supplemental info page on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Turning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 23.6%. This compares with the 23.7% GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of last year. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was slightly higher at 23.7% for the quarter and that's consistent with the prior year non-GAAP tax rate. Again please refer to the supplemental information page on the Investor Relations page of our website for a reconciliation of GAAP taxes to non-GAAP taxes. We estimate our full year effective tax rate will continue to be in the 24% range on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.","Moving on to net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for Q2 of 2019, it was $116.8 million or $0.78 per diluted share and this compares with the prior year GAAP net income of $110.6 million or $0.72 per share. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2019 was $125.7 million or $0.84 per diluted share and this compares with non-GAAP net income of $117 million or 76% -- $0.76 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018. This represents growth of 7.4% and 10.5%, respectively for net income and EPS.","I'd like to provide some additional detail on our results from continuing operations and note that amortization from acquired intangible assets was $28 million pre-tax or $0.14 per diluted share for the current quarter of Q2 and that compares to $18.4 million pre-tax or $0.09 per diluted share in the same period last year.","For the first half of the year that's a same number was $49.8 million pr\u00eat-ax or $0.25 per diluted share and compares to $37.1 million pre-tax or $0.18 per diluted share in the same period last year. I'll also note that in Q2 of this year, foreign currency exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS by $0.01 per share.","Let's now look at some of the details of our sales results for the second quarter. Our dental sales were $1.6 billion and decreased 0.7% compared with the prior year with positive internal growth in local currencies of 0.7%.","North American internal growth in local currencies was 0.3% and included a 1.3% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise. Note again that there's 1.3% growth is also from a tough prior year comparison where we reported 4.7% growth -- internal growth in local currencies.","Our dental equipment sales and service, internal sales declined by 2.9% in local currencies on a year-over-year basis in North America. This was mainly due to a decline in high-tech equipment sales versus the same period last year, primarily related to our digital sensor center category. And also internal CAD\/CAM equipment sales in local currencies in North America decreased by 6.4% in the current quarter.","We faced a tough year-over-year comparison due to the Omnicam system promotion that bolstered sales in Q2 of last year. And we saw a decline in the average sales price due to promotional activity to sell out the Omnicam 1.0 units that we had in inventory during Q2, 2019. Internal traditional equipment sales in local currencies was essentially flat year-over-year.","If we look at international dental sales growth, in local currencies, it was 1.3%. This included 2.3% growth in dental consumable merchandise which was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the timing of Holy Thursday and Good Friday holidays. As you may recall, we saw benefit from this timing in the first quarter of 2019 and now we're seeing the reversal of that.","International dental equipment sales and service revenue declined 2.0% versus the same period. This decline was primarily related to a change in our business model in Brazil. And if you exclude the Brazil equipment sales, our international dental equipment internal sales growth was 2.6% in local currency. And as we expected our performance in the DACH region, Germany, and Austria, as well as The Netherlands saw a boost from the IDS Trade Show in March of this year.","Medical sales were $698 million in the second quarter, an increase of 13.6% with internally generated sales growth at local currencies of 7.6%. The 7.6% internal growth at local currencies comprised 7.8% growth in North America and 1% growth internationally.","We are very pleased with our overall Medical sales results, which once again, was driven by solid organic growth along with strategic acquisitions. We believe our Medical group is very well-positioned with large group practices, independent physician offices, and other ultimate sites of care with strong customer relationships in each category contributing to our growth.","Technology and Value-Added Services sales from continuing operations were $125 million in the second quarter, an increase of 39.9% with internally generated sales in local currencies down 1.21%.","In North America, the Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth in local currencies was down 1.8% on an as-reported basis. However, when normalizing for product switches from direct to agency sales and ongoing transition of our technology platforms to a cloud-based SaaS model, internal sales growth in North America increased by 0.7%.","Internationally, our internal Technology and Value-Added Services sales increased by 1.9% in local currencies. I'll also note that our dental equipment sales -- our slower dental equipment sales led to lower financial services revenue as we financed less equipment related to lower sales.","We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the second quarter borrowing approximately 1.2 million shares at an average price of $64.95 for total of approximately $77 million. The impact of this repurchase of shares on our second quarter diluted EPS was immaterial.","At the close of the second quarter, Henry Schein had approximately $173 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock. If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our cash flow, operating cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $165.5 million which compares to $176.5 million for the second quarter of last year and we continue to believe we'll have strong operating cash flow for the full year.","As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in Q2 of 2019 of $11.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share. This restructuring charge primarily includes severance pay and facility closing costs.","During the second quarter, we concluded this 2018\/2019 initiative which had a total cost of $79.5 million. We do not expect to record any additional restructuring cost in the second quarter of 2019. I'll now conclude my remarks by noting that we are providing 2019 financial GAAP -- financial guidance on a GAAP basis and also affirming our 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range.","On a GAAP basis 2019 diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, which includes restructuring cost of $0.08 per diluted share, is expected to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.23. This represents growth of 18% to 23% compared to the 2018 GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was $2.80.","On a non-GAAP basis 2019 diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $3.38 to $3.50 reflecting growth of 7% to 10%, compared with the 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was of $3.17. Our outlook for 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations excludes the $0.08 restructuring expenses and also $0.01 credit to income tax expense that relates to the Animal Health spin-off. 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations excluded certain expenses and benefits, netting to a charge of $0.37 per diluted share as reflected in our 2018 earnings press release.","As always, our guidance for 2019 GAAP and non-GAAP attributable to Henry Schein is for continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. Also our guidance assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. Finally, the guidance assumes that the end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions. With that I'd like to now turn the call back over to Stanley.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin with a review of business highlights from our second quarter, starting with Dental. Dental consumable merchandise sales in North America grew by 1.3% in local currency. It's on an internal basis without acquisitions. As Steven mentioned, this is a tough prior year comparable, but we also believe this result is reflective of a relatively low end market growth in the U. S. and that Henry Schein grew slightly faster than our end markets in the U.S.","We believe that we continue to increase our global market share in line with our goal, which remains to grow faster than our end markets. A highlight of our North American Dental consumables merchandise business has been sales of specialty dental products which includes implants, orthodontic, endodontic solutions as well as bone regeneration products. Sales of these products continue to grow at healthy rates.","In the second quarter, global internal dental specialty sales increased by 6.5% in local currencies, all on an internal basis without acquisitions. Acquisitions add to that and so our global position in the specialty areas continues to grow very, very nicely and we are pleased with the performances of those businesses.","As Steven mentioned, North American dental equipment sales growth was impacted by lower high-tech equipment sales, especially CAD\/CAM sales as we had a difficult comparable. During the second quarter of 2018, we had our most successful promotion of Omnicam systems. In the second quarter of 2019, we had a successful Omnicam inventory clearance promotion. So we were focused on Omnicam in this quarter from an inventory clearance point of view. And this resulted in lower units failing prices. So if you take that category into account it had a significant dampening effect on our 2019 second quarter sales of equipment.","That said, Dentsply Sirona's new Primescan system has been generating a lot of excitement among dentists and we will start focusing more and more on this system, not only in Europe where we had actually done very well, but in the U.S. as our Omnicam inventory is completed.","In North America, we had historically only sold other brands of CAD\/CAM solutions, while we have had a relatively small market share in the past for Dentsply Sirona's CAD\/CAM systems we believe we are well-positioned to grow this market share over time along with the other brands of CAD\/CAM solutions that we offer and have had such great success.","Let me point out also that, although traditional equipment sales reflect this was on 8.4% growth in the second quarter of 2018. In March, we participated in the IDS event in Germany, which occurs every two years. While we had a successful IDS with the second quarter sales in local currencies in the DACH region growing by 11.8%, we believe we had an extremely successful IDS and picked up market share specifically on the equipment side and the DACH regions.","Our international dental equipment internal sales in local currencies declined by 2%. Why? The decline was largely due, in fact due to the negative sales impact associated with Brazil that Steven discussed.","Notably, international CAD\/CAM equipment internal sales experience double-digit growth in local currencies, driven to a large extent by Primescan in Europe. The dental community, manufacturers, distributors and practitioners all agree and there's a lot of published on this that continued innovation is key to improvement in digital dentistry workflow, and therefore, better quality of care and more efficient practices.","For the benefit of cost, for the practice, yes but also for the patient. We expect to see increased adoption of a broad array of digital dentistry solutions over time as we educate practitioners on the benefits of these solutions that meaningfully advance the dental profession.","We remain extremely optimistic about the future of digital dentistry and particularly our role in that not only with respect to dental operatories but also in the dental laboratory field where we are of course the leader in supply consumables and equipment to dental laboratories.","We continue to believe that there is a significant opportunity for us to increase our global sales of CAD\/CAM products in all the markets we are active in as dentistry moves through this digital platform. Today we have full access to a broad array of solutions for our customers.","So, in June Henry Schein made a couple of strategic investments -- or in this quarter shall we say. In June the acquisition was of an investment of the Hayes Handpiece franchise, a leading provider of dental handpiece products and services in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. with 2018 sales of approximately $11.3 million. The Hayes sales and repair business is an excellent complement to our expansive dental support and services business activities that are growing. In other words, yet another Value-Add Services opportunity for our customers to avail themselves of.","Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Cliniclands which serves dentists in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway with dental consumables, implants, prosthetic, and orthodontic solutions and equipment. This represents Henry Schein's dental initial presence in Scandinavia.","Cliniclands have sales for the 12 months ended March 31st, 2019 of approximately $9.5 million. So, we are optimistic, comfortable with our Dental business -- with the strategy and believe we are making very good progress in our strategic goals as we advance our presence in the dental operatory and dental laboratory markets.","Now, let's review the Medical business. We delivered solid Medical internal sales growth in the second quarter of 7.6% in local currencies. Our unique sales and marketing push to Medical customers including large integrated delivery networks, as well as large group practices that comprise the largest part of the market, have served as well.","Many of these healthcare services groups are sophisticated large-scale organizations that require high touch approach and we have a proven model to service both ends of the spectrum, large IDNs as well as independent GPs which ultimately are Henry Schein's end customers. So, we feel good with our strategy to advance our position in the physician, ambulatory care, with the surgery centers, or urgent centers markets, both with GPs and with specialists.","We are also investing in a huge amount in the specialty areas such as orthopedics, podiatry, neurology, and many others sub-segments of healthcare as well as our recent investments in North American Rescue. All this has enabled us to grow faster than the end market growth.","Now let's move to the Technology and Value-Added Services business. July marked the one-year anniversary the formation of Henry Schein One, a platform designed to deliver powerful dental software solutions that help dentists operate more efficiently their practices and build awareness for the practice. So, that at the end of the day our goal is to help the practitioner operate a more efficient practice, so that they can be positioned to provide outstanding clinical care and at the same time, we are significantly focused on creating demand for our customers bringing to the attention to the public the importance of oral care and in fact identifying potential customers -- patients for our practitioners and driving their traffic into the practitioners' offices.","We have spent the past year listening to our customers and rather than offer a selection of our solutions, we have created bundled commercial platforms for our Henry Schein One technology services that are specifically designed to best meet the practitioners' evolving practice needs. Of course, part of this includes our transition to SaaS or cloud-based delivery model systems. In this model our customers can reduce their upfront cost, as they will no longer need expensive application service and software at the practice.","As Henry Schein One continues to innovate and effectively deliver those solutions, practitioners will access those innovations and upgrades via the cloud. This includes advanced websites, reputation management tools, improved search engine results, online marketing and automated digital communications.","For each of these areas we have business functions as business is focused to advance these specific areas of software and related services in the dental practice. No one else has complete an offering as we do and no other business has the installed base that we have to seek synergies between that installed base and these value-added services in the software field that we are offering.","These transitions have impacted our growth rates in the near term, but we believe that we are positioning Henry Schein One to increase sales of these higher-margin solutions through this recurring revenue model for a long time to come. We are really comfortable and in fact excited about this business model and are making progress on advancing the business model, a unique set of businesses, functions, software opportunities that Henry Schein has to take into our software customers but in general to our dental customers, laboratory customers and into the general marketplace of the dental community.","We also see significant opportunities to coordinate efforts between our Henry Schein One and Henry Schein Dental distribution team. The goal is to increasingly cross-sell our software solutions with practitioners, who rely on Henry Schein for consumable merchandise and equipment products used every day. While many of these customers use our practice management software solutions today, we believe that a significant upside opportunity in selling our new patient engagement and patient acquisition tools. We look forward to beginning to launch these programs later this year.","As a final comment, in July, we announced our entry into Italian dental practice management software market with a small but important strategic acquisition of a company named Elite Computer Italia. Although, we have served dental practitioners in Italy since 2004, we are now well positioned to offer the highly regarded OrisLine family of software products. Elite had sales of approximately $6 million in 2018, not material, but very important from a strategic point of view.","This, of course, follows our earlier acquisition that we announced earlier acquisitions of Lighthouse, a provider of easy-to-use dental practice management patient communication software with 2018 sales of approximately $50 million, as well as Kopfwerk, a leading dental practice management solution company in Austria with sales of US$2.2 million. These solutions are being integrated into the one \u2013 Henry Schein One portfolio of technology solutions, dedicating to delivering end-to-end management and marketing systems for dental practice. Again it's not the amount of the sale in these instances, but the stickiness that we believe the Italian and Austrian acquisitions will create through our core business as well. We plan to continue to expand our technology software offerings in both North America and international markets.","So in summary, we believe that we continue to make solid progress in implementing our 2018 to 2019 corporate strategic plan and reach in fact the halfway mark, which is centered around three key strategies: distribution with expansion of our core dental and Medical businesses as we continue to build scale and expand our geographies. Huge amount of progress being made in this area, and it is hard actually always to understand all the ups and downs because this is a complex set of matrix. But in general we are very, very comfortable with the progress we're making on the distribution side of our dental and Medical businesses.","The second strategy is to advance value-added services, obviously, to advance our solutions, services and support for our customers. These are profitable business initiatives that also provide stickiness to our base customers and so the synergies here have shown to be very, very productive.","And our third strategy, partnering with our broad set of manufacturers as well as building Henry Schein brand equity with a key goal of expanding our product margin. It is critical that our customers understand the value that we provide under the Henry Schein brand in terms of services products, so we need to ensure that our brand commitment is clearly understood while at the same time advancing Henry Schein products and services sold under Henry Schein own brands.","With that operator, we would like to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim.","Glen Santangelo","Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Steve, I just wanted to talk to you a little bit more about the equipment side of business. It feels like the real delta relative to your expectations was on the equipment side. And so I was hoping you can maybe unpack that equipment number a little bit and maybe; A, give us a better sense of what you saw on basic versus high-tech and how meaningful was Brazil? Just anything that might be helpful for us as we think about modeling the back half of the year.","And then secondly for Stan as a follow-up with respect to the Technology and value-added services, I appreciate the comments. And it certainly seems like you have the right strategy in place with the Henry Schein One platform. But this is the first quarter I can think of where growth in this segment was negative. And so I was just kind of curious as do you view this quarter as a one-off, or was there some type of inflection that we should be aware of? Thanks and I\u2019ll stop there.","Stanley Bergman","Okay. Glen, I'll start with your first question. Thanks for the question. If we look at the North American dental equipment side, roughly two-thirds of our sales in North American equipment is traditional equipment and roughly one-third is high-tech equipment.","What we saw was during the quarter, we saw traditional equipment being relatively flat year-over-year growth. And really the weakness on a year-over-year basis was in the high-tech category and there's really two pieces of it. There's digital imaging both the 2D and the 3D imaging which was down. And we think the big reason why it was down was average selling prices are down in this product category and it's also become more of a mature category as more and more people have access -- or have digital X-ray.","Separately, the other key component of high-tech equipment is CAD\/CAM. On the CAD\/CAM side, again Stanley spoke about that we will focus on blowing out the old Omnicam equipment during the quarter. We really while we were selling the new Primescan, I think in earnest we'll really focus more of that in the second half of the year.","So, those two categories really were down in the high-tech equipment, call it roughly 6% or 7%. And when you blend that together with traditional equipment, you get to that negative 2.9% for the quarter.","If you look at international equipment, international equipment was really negatively impacted by then Brazil. And just to give you a little bit more detail, there are certain segments of the core dental equipment market in Brazil which A, are very low-margin; and B, require significant dating or terms of sale which could run a year or longer.","And because of those two conditions, it's really not very profitable at all and we decided to stop selling to those segments of equipment. And when you back out that, our international dental equipment sales grew by 2.6% in constant currency. So, really we had decent growth in international dental equipment excluding the Brazil activity. So, hopefully that provides you the additional color that you were looking for.","Glen Santangelo","Yes, that's great. And maybe Stan if we can talk about that Tech and Value-Added Services?","Stanley Bergman","Yes sure. Just let me also emphasize that the comparables are really important. In 2018, we had a significant and successful promotion of Omnicam in the U.S. And also we had something like 8% growth -- over 8% of our traditional equipment.","So, you add those too and it's sort of almost a perfect storm. But we remain highly, highly enthusiastic about our Dental business on the equipment side in the U.S., North America, Canada, as well where we're doing quite well, and in Europe. So, on the Henry Schein financials -- what is it? Call it\u2026","Steven Paladino","Technology and Value-Add.","Stanley Bergman","Tech and Value-Added Services there's quite a bit that goes into it. Remember from a sales point of view, it's a relatively small number compared to the whole company. So within that, our financial services, the fact that on a comparable basis, equipment sales was lower in North America than in the previous year that impacted our ability to provide leasing services.","The second is within that business, there is a business called TechCentral which sells computer hardware, not a great business, but it's a service. We are selling less computer hardware than in the past because essentially the stuff can be bought at lower prices elsewhere. And I think it's just an area that is not as robust as in the past certainly compared to the previous year. And that brings -- suppresses the earnings.","There's lumpiness that has to be taken into account. We have some pretty large contracts and you have to be very careful at fine point. Henry Schein's former practice solutions businesses sold a lot of demand generation software, but nowhere near the amount of demand generation software as Internet Brands sold. So we are reporting internal growth, not complete growth. If you look at the complete growth, I think, the business grew by something like 40%.","It really doesn't matter exactly whether the internal growth is perfect or not. What counts is where this deal is going to end up or where this joint venture is going to end up a year from now when the -- or actually you'll start seeing it in the next quarter, when the deal has been annualized. So, whether, it's a couple of hundred basis points or even, yes, one way or the other, it's not that relevant and it's really very hard to determine what the exact internal growth rate is on these demand generation software systems, because if we switch a customer to an Internet Brands system, that's a negative on our internal growth.","So I think, at the end of the day, the success of this business should be judged, actually next quarter and beyond, when this deal annualizes, because it's a very small base. And for the reasons I've given you, one can misinterpret the impact of a few hundred basis points either way, in terms of sales or even profits. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson, Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Steve, I wanted to follow-up on Glen's question on the equipment side of the business in North America this quarter. I think your explanations make total sense, getting rid of some of that Omnicam inventory in that. But maybe, talk to us about just the underlying demand or an interest you're seeing from dentists on digital impression systems, number one. And maybe counter that DI versus full in office CAD\/CAM. What do you think over the next year or two you might see the mix of full systems versus the DI? Would be interested in your thoughts there. Thank you.","Steven Paladino","Sure. Thanks Jeff. I would say that we expect to see continued interest in both the standalone DI, as well as the full systems. I think that there are some customers who kind of would like to walk before they run, so they move to DI and then hopefully over time they'll buy the full CAD\/CAM system. It's hard to really predict with great accuracy which will be stronger than the other. But I think they'll both be pretty good growers. Does that help you?","Jeff Johnson","It does. Thank you. And maybe be just as a follow-up, on the consumable side in North America, on the dental side, you gave a 6.5% global, I believe, specialty business. But if I assume specialty in North America was up somewhere in that same ballpark, it would seem as if the general consumables part of your business was flat maybe even down a little bit.","So two questions on that. One, just what's going on in your DSO business versus your GP or general practitioner kind of private dentist business? Any difference to call out in growth rate between those two? And just, is there any changes going on with any kind of contractual status with any of your DSOs, at least, at this point? Thank you.","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thanks Jeff. No. The real issue with consumables and why it was a little bit softer on a year-over-year basis versus the prior quarter over the last couple of quarters, related to one of the months of during the quarter. We really saw an extremely weak April. We're not sure we understand exactly why April was as weak as it was, but the good news was it rebounded in May and May was stronger. And June was really very strong for us.","I'll also note that the month of July, while it wasn't quite as strong as June was also a pretty solid month in consumable merchandise for us. So it really wasn't related to DSO's mix between DSOs and private practice or anything like that. It was really just that April month was extremely weak for us. And again we're kind of scratching our heads saying why was that month so weak? But yeah it rebounded in May, June and July. So that was the key reason.","Stanley Bergman","And Jeff I think what's important to add to Steven's comments is that, although we are doing very well with the specialties as a percentage of total sales of consumables, it's small. But it is important from an operating margin and operating -- profit contribution. So I think it's hard sometimes to see that when you look at the externally reported numbers.","Jeff Johnson","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from the line of Jonathan Block, Stifel.","Jonathan Block","Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe just two for me. The first one, it\u2019s more of a clarification Stanley and Steven, but I think it's important one. So for Brazil it just seems like a different approach to market. And so I believe we should think about that headwind continuing into the back half of 2019 and even 1Q 2020. Is that correct before you lap and change any approach to market? And then I got a second question.","Stanley Bergman","I think you've got to allow for that to annualize out. An unusual phenomenon in Brazil is a couple of very strong different equipment providers. And for us to compete with them in certain areas particularly this traditional equipment it's just not worth it. We did have a similar situation in Italy, maybe a decade ago and we addressed that through in a strategic alliance that we entered into in Italy and that has resulted -- I'm not saying we will do that in Brazil or not. It's too early to tell.","But we just don't think it's a good idea to operate in this traditional equipment market in Brazil when the margins are so low and the gating is so long and the risks of bad debt receivables is high. So having said that the consumable business is doing extremely well and it's our intention to focus on high-tech equipment and particularly the specialty areas in Brazil as well as our core business, which as I said is doing well. But Brazil has been a very good market for us. Don't read anything into this other than we're getting out of an unprofitable business.","Jonathan Block","Got it. Very helpful. And then let's shift gears, Stan I'll stick with you. On capital deployment, you've gone through -- you finished the restructuring now. You've got the big check or cash deals from Covetrus. I know you've done some small deals. But with a better balance sheet and restructuring now in the rearview mirror, maybe you can talk to Schein's appetite for something larger, possibly more transformative and how your pipeline looks over the next six to 12 months from a deals perspective? Thanks guys.","Stanley Bergman","Yeah, sure. Our pipeline remains solid. Obviously no deals until they\u2019re done. We have appetite for something larger but it has to make sense. There are very strict investment criteria not so much on what we paid for the business or the size of the business or the profit of the business going into it, but what it looks like once integrated into the Henry Schein portfolio. We have interest in Medical. We have interest in expanding globally on our core business. We have appetite for specialty businesses in dental and Medical. And so adding to the software platform continues. I think we put quite a bit of capital to work already this year and we expect to continue in years to come.","But we -- as you know, we are conservative and we view the future of an acquisition not so much with the cash return only, but -- which has to be good, but the accounting fully loaded with depreciation and amortization. And I think if we are reporting on a cash basis, actually our performance this quarter over the first six months will be better. But at the end of the day, we prefer to go at this more conservative approach which has stood us well for the past 25 years.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from the line of John Kreger, William Blair.","John Kreger","Hi, thanks very much. Stan can you talk about the runway that you see remaining within the digital -- various digital categories and dental? It sounds like kind of classic imaging has -- or is getting closer to a full penetration. But if you could just sort of go down the list, where do you see the biggest opportunities for penetration expansion over let's say the next five years? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Yes. So, that actually is a very good question. On the imaging, the machines themselves, I think there's a lot of runaway in this country and abroad although I do think the average price per unit is coming down. I'm not saying our profit per unit is coming down, but I think there has to be some deflation in this area I would say, particularly in the U.S. So, I think that's what you could expect. But having said that, there are still many, many dentists that could use digital imaging in their practice.","The second thing on the centers that's more commoditized, we're hoping that one or two manufacturers come out with some unique technology. There are promises in that regard, but we haven't seen.","So, at the moment to a large extent, it's digitalized -- the digital sensors are a mature product and so it's replacement business. Having said that, there is an opportunity in the cloud area. Having said that a lot of that may actually in our world be classified over time as technology products versus equipment. So, there is opportunity there. We're very excited we've invested in that area.","As it relates to the prosthetic side, I think the lab world continues to advance in that area. We're going to see a few more larger labs and much less smaller labs. As these larger labs consolidate, they're investing heavily in the space, I believe we're the leader in this space and we'll do well.","As it relates to full systems, I think we will continue to see expansion in that area. We continue in Germany where the market is the most advanced. We are well-positioned to continue with the full system. We have sold the Sirona system there for decades and have the expertise. I think over time you will see our expertise expand in North America in this regard and we will do better.","But we're relatively new to the Sirona full CAD\/CAM system and our sales capabilities are expanding. This is a big opportunity for us going forward. As it relates to DI, I think there will be opportunity here. I think the prices are coming down. But those manufacturers that come up with new technology as Primescan is, will do well. We did well with Primescan in Europe. I think in the DACH region where we had the IDS and that was a great place to show the product. I think, you've got to show these products at shows, at conventions to really get the traction. And in the U.S. we will focus on Omnicam. I think there's a Primescan opportunity here.","I also want to point out one other thing that Sirona will this year is in the fourth quarter, not the third quarter. So I think one has to take a look at all these ups and downs before judging the company's performance on any one quarter. I think you will see that in a given 12-month period, we have done well in this equipment world, also the consumables and remain quite optimistic that we will be able to continue to do well in equipment global market share.","But please do not watch each quarter and make decisions on one quarter versus another. This is a lumpy business. As you'll recall, I think, four quarters ago we had something like 18% growth in the equipment. And so, we just have to be very careful as we judge the company based on any one particular quarter and make any decisions relative to one particular category. The dental equipment business is good. Dentists are investing in their practices and high-tech is definitely an area of growth.","John Kreger","Great. Thanks Stan. There's also one quick follow-up. How are you feeling about your clear aligner offering within ortho? Is it gaining any traction, or it's just still too soon to tell? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Well, that\u2019s also a good question. So I would say to you that, as we've said on numerous calls, we're early into this aligner strategy. We believe we have a very good solution. We're educating the markets on the benefits of our clear aligner solutions, which includes the SLX for the specialists and the Reveal for the GP.","We believe that the long-term opportunity for growth in this market is attractive. The whole market is attractive and we believe that we all get a share of that, both from a sales point of view and a profit point of view. And we're excited about participating, but it's much too early for us to come to any conclusions.","We know on the specialists side we're getting good traction from our KOLs, we have some very good KOLs. And the Henry Schein sales force is quite excited to be selling the Reveal product. It was voted the number one product at our June National Sales Meeting. That's not so long ago. We have to allow for our products to be understood by our specialty customers and by our sales force in the Henry Schein Dental business.","We're not abroad yet. We expect to bring it -- take it abroad sometime in 2020. I think a combination of Reveal and SLX. But in any event, our orthodontic business is small. It's a meaningful business and adds to our overall market share growth in the specialty area. So kind of long story short, we're very small in this space. We're quite small in orthodontics. We're bigger in endodontics and implants, in particular in bone regeneration. So I think the clear aligners will add to our specialty position. But at this point, it's relatively small.","John Kreger","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Ellich, Craig-Hallum. ","Kevin Ellich","Thanks for taking the question. Stan, last quarter, I think, we talked about some of the innovative dental models like mobile dental. So I wanted to get your thoughts this time on the concierge dental market and businesses like dental bar in New York and other disruptors. I guess, where do you think -- where do you see that in the overall grand scheme of things? And how much could that add to your growth?","Stanley Bergman","Yeah. What I don't think I should do is comment on any specific provider. Having said that, innovation is going to occur. I think the DSO will continue to grow. In particular this mid-sized practices continue to grow. They're bringing innovative ideas to the marketplace. I'm not sure with this retail in close dentistry is going to go. I'm quite sure that where a dentist is involved in providing clinical care it's going to be well-received. Where a dentist is not involved, I think there's going to be challenges. I'm not a clinician but I can only imagine that if dentists are not involved it's not going to -- there's not going to be the appropriate quality of care.","Having said that, over time whitening products did go in the drug store shelf. And at the same time, our dentists are doing very well with lighting products. So I do believe that there will be additions to this model, equivalents of Uber in transportation. And I can only think that this will be advantageous because half of the American population doesn't go to the dentist. And in particular, I believe some of these models will attract millennials and the younger generation to see a dentist.","Having said that, I have to say that dental DSOs that have retail space, ground floor on Main Street's tend to be doing very, very well. So I remain quite optimistic about the future of dentistry because at the foundation the studies that are coming out are showing that there is a direct correlation between good oral care and good health care, so I think this is only going to get better as the payers and even the federal government and local governments understand the importance of oral care in the continuum of care.","Kevin Ellich","Appreciate that. And then with the Cliniclands acquisition, just wanted to see if you could give us any details on how fast the Scandinavian dental markets are growing. And then what are the geographies would you like to expand into? And I have a follow-up for Steve.","Stanley Bergman","Yeah. First of all please remember it's a very small business $10 million, $9.5 million. It's essentially a electronic business with some salespeople, doesn't sell a huge amount of equipment. We will expand that. The market is a big market. I would not expect to gain significant market share with this particular vehicle, but it is a fast growing business. It will generate sales. It helps advance our digital platform.","But that digital platform will have to be married with other kinds of practice management software at the time as well as equipment sales and service and we believe field sales representation.","We're in this business is essentially Swedish that has some business in Denmark. We already sale some products in Denmark from our German business and sale some products in Norway. These are \u2013 Norway\u2019s a very small market. And that's the area we expect to -- this business to continue to grow. We're hopeful by the way that the business will also help us advance our implant market share and our specialty businesses in general.","Kevin Ellich","Great. And then how fast do you think the U.S. end market is going? I know you said you want to pace it, but just wondering if you had a number that you can help us out with.","Stanley Bergman","Yeah. Again very, very hard to tell. We believe the markets are definitely stable; they are going to the minus category. If you had asked that question in April, I would to be concerned. But in May and June and July, as Steven pointed out, we believe there's much more traction in the markets that we're hearing from our suppliers. But the market is definitely stable and leading in a positive direction.","I'm not sure there's much inflation. There could be with some of the DSO's deflation, but in any event, I do not believe the market is going backwards. For us, of course, we want to continue to grow our core businesses which obviously grow faster if the market is growing faster. But for us the opportunity lies in our specialty businesses, gaining market share with our Henry Schein One business not only in the U.S. and Canada, but globally.","So, the markets are in a positive direction, but I think the Henry Schein prospects of the future are much more driven not only by the market growth, but all these other strategies to enter to advance our position into higher-margin areas and products and services and also, of course, to become more efficient as providers of these products and services. ","Operator","We have time for one last question. That will come from the line of Nathan Rich, Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones for Steve. Gross margins are up nicely in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could kind of comment on what drove the expansion. I know you're rolling -- still rolling in some of the higher-margin tech businesses. So, just curious how much of those contributed to the margin performance in the quarter. And if you could kind of comment on the margin trends you're seeing for the Dental and Medical businesses?","Steven Paladino","Sure. So, thanks for the question Nathan. If you look at overall gross margins, gross margins were driven -- the improvement was driven virtually completely by Technology and a greater percentage of Technology including the acquisition or the joint venture with Henry Schein One.","I think it's important also to note that that came with incremental expenses. So, when you look at operating margin expansion, the opposite is true. The operating margin expansion came exclusively from the Healthcare Distribution business not a Technology business. So, it's a little bit complicated there, but gross margin is driven by Technology, but operating margins driven by Healthcare Distribution. ","Nathan Rich","Okay, that's helpful. And just a very quick follow-up Steve. When you -- you talked about kind of June and July being strong kind of relative to April what's the magnitude of the delta that we should be thinking about as you're talking about the area you're seeing that's kind of month-to-month volatility?","Steven Paladino","Yes. It was quite significant the magnitude. If you look at North American consumables, April was actually down slightly and May and June were positive and grew from May to June. So really a big turnaround between April, that weakness that we saw versus May and June. So, we're hopeful that that's a bit of an anomaly because again we have three months after April where we saw a pretty decent growth in consumable sales. And again it's hard to isolate why that one was so weak, but it just was. ","Carolynne Borders","Holly, we're ready to take questions.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call over to you for closing comments.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you very much operator. As we close today's call, I would like to reiterate that we are most excited about the future of Henry Schein and many opportunities ahead in global Dental and Medical markets we serve. We are halfway through our 2018, 2019 and 2020 strategic plan.","We're quite pleased with the progress we've made as we advance our key initiatives, not only to grow our footprint and our position and market share in the global Dental and Medical markets, both growth in terms of market share and profitability, the whole area of value-added services, the second strategy and marketing Schein value-added services as important connections to our core business. That's moving along quite nicely.","And then, of course, to make sure that our customers understand clearly what the brand commitment is of Henry Schein, what we do, how we differentiate ourselves from our competition, the value we provide to our suppliers, and at the same time advance our market position our brands, specifically in the specialty areas, Dental and Medical that we own.","So very, very excited about the future. Of course, if you have any further questions, please contact Carolynne Borders in Investor Relations 631-390-8105. And look forward to speaking to you again at the Baird Healthcare Conference in September or when we next report our earnings in early November. So have a very good rest of the summer. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.","Carolynne Borders","Thank you, Ray, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2018 second quarter. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.

Please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up during Q&A to allow as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour we have allotted.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are quite pleased with our results for the second quarter, which reflects solid revenue growth in general healthy end markets, as well as our continued success in gaining market share in all of our business groups.","We are in early stages of executing on our new strategic plan for 2018 to 2020. Yet we're already making solid strides, and expanding our offering of innovative solutions, and extending our value proposition for our customers. We are indeed excited about the potential for our new dental technology joint venture Henry Schein won, which closed on July 1. This joint venture was created to deliver integrated dental technology that combines leading practice management, marketing and patient engagement solutions into one connected management system. Our medical business remains highly relevant, as of course, reflected by our continuous and sustained growth in sales and market share.","We are on track with - prepared for the plan you know [ph] of our Global Animal Health business with Vets First Choice, and a combination with Vets First Choice, which will create a new publicly-traded company to be named Vets First Corp. We believe this transaction will unlock shareholder value for Henry Schein shareholders, as Vets First Corp will be well-positioned to achieve a premium market evaluation. In addition, of course, we believe Henry Schein will continue to drive further growth in our leadership positions in our dental and medical businesses as a result of our sharp focus, and of course, increased investment of resources.","We are focused on the development of practice management and clinical solutions that are highly relevant to our customers, and we have been successful as a result of our commitment to a high-touch value-added approach, which has advanced our brand equity. We are committed to the strategy in long-term, and we believe it will continue to advance our brand equity, and accordingly, shareholder value.","Our strong relevance to our customers also means a continued focus on accelerated innovation within our dental, medical, and animal health platforms, particularly with dental's digital dentistry, and we remain agile embracing an operating culture that is fast. It stays true to our values, and our collaborative and entrepreneurial spirit.","With exciting changes taking place for the Henry Schein this year, we are at a pivotal moment as we draw it forward with innovation that we believe distinguishes our go-to-market strategy, and will help our customers operate in more efficient practice. So the practitioners can deliver quality clinical care. I would also note that we are providing more details today on our comprehensive restructuring plan designed to increase profitability by improving business efficiencies, reducing redundancies, and optimizing Henry Schein's infrastructure. Steven will walk you through those details, but first, I would like to comment on why we are undertaking this initiative.","If I'm continuing to streamline our operations, we expect to create a leaner organization that will allow us to better serve our customer's rapidly-changing needs and our ability to continue to build shareholder value. These changes are difficult to make. However, we recognize they are necessary to enable Henry Schein to continue to build upon our success as well as to deliver solid long-term financial service to our shareholders.","Now, let me ask Steve to review our financial results, restructuring, and guidance. And then, I'll provide some additional commentary on recent business performance and our accomplishments. Steven?","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, I would like to point out that I will be discussing our results, both on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis.","Our Q2 2018 non-GAAP results exclude restructuring costs of $14.9 million pre-tax or $0.07 per diluted share as well as transaction cost related to the planned Animal Health spin-off of $7.6 million pre-tax or $0.05 per diluted share. Also, our Q2 2017 non-GAAP results exclude a litigation settlement expense of approximately of $5.3 million pre-tax or $0.02 per diluted share.","We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business and able to comparison the financial results between periods, where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures. For reconciliation, see Exhibit B in this morning's earnings release as well as on the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","So, now turning to our results, net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 were $3.3 billion, reflecting 8.7% increase compared with the second quarter of 2017 with internally-generated sales growth in local currencies of 4.8%. When also excluding the impact of certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales, which impacts both our animal health and to a lesser extent our technology businesses in North America, our normalized internal sales growth in local currencies were 6.1%. You could also see the details of our sales growth on Exhibit A of our earnings news release.","Operating margin for the second quarter of 2018 was 6.1% and contracted by 83 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2017, as a result of the few factors. Our operating margin in the second quarter included restructuring cost as well as the transaction cost related to the planned Animal Health spin-off and the prior year included litigation cost. These three items combined to negatively impact the year-over-year operating margin comparison by 50 basis points. Excluding the impact of these items, our operating margin contracted by about 33 basis points year-over-year.","The operating margin in the second quarter was negatively impacted primarily by lower gross margins in North America. We do have as a priority a plan to increase sales of higher margin products to drive gross margin improvements across our businesses. We believe this will enhance our offering with additional technology as well as other practice management solutions while advancing our specialty products businesses, our Henry Schein brand, and our other exclusive products and brands, just to name the few areas of focus. These initiative will take a little bit time and the investment - and investments of the return will be not recognized immediately, but we believe we can make good progress towards these goals this year as we execute on our - by 2018 to 2020 strategic plan.","Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 24.9%. This compares to 28.7% of our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the income tax benefits of the restructuring and spin-off cost - our effective tax rate 24.1% and this compares to 29.0% for the second quarter of last year also on an non-GAAP basis. We believe our full year 2018 effective tax rate will be in the 24% range.","Moving on, net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. was $141.2 million or $0.92 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, representing growth of 3.8% and 7% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the second quarter of 2018 was $159.8 million or $1.04 per diluted share. And this represents growth of 14.7% and 18.2% respectively compared with the second quarter of 2017.","I'd also like to provide some additional color on our results noting that amortization from acquired intangible assets was $30.2 million pre-tax or $0.15 per diluted share for Q2 2018. And for the first-half of the year amortization from acquired intangibles assets was $61.3 million pre-tax or $0.30 per diluted share. Also note a foreign currency exchange had a positive impact on diluted EPS for the quarter of approximately $0.01 per share.","Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the second quarter. We call that Good Friday sell in Q2 last year compared to Q1 this year which resulted in one additional selling day in Q2 of the current year and several major countries internationally and I'll discuss those details in a moment.","Dental sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased 8.4% to $1.6 billion with internal growth in local currencies of 4.4%. Our North American internal growth in local currencies was 5.1% and included 4.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and growth of 6.2% in sales of dental equipment sales and service. The impact on dental consumable merchandise sales growth related to Good Friday was relatively immaterial at approximately 15 basis points.","Our International Dental internal growth in local currencies was 3.4% which included 3% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise which was favorably impacted by approximately 1% due to the timing of Good Friday and our growth in dental equipment sales internationally was 4.7%.","Our Animal Health sales were $985.9 million in the second quarter, an increase of 10.6% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 4.4%. The 4.4% internal growth in local currencies included 3.2% growth in North America. However, when normalizing for the impact of a manufacturer switching from a direct to an agency agreement, sales growth was a robust 10.9%. We believe this double-digit normalized sales growth for the quarter reflects a healthy end market.","International Animal Health sales growth in local currencies was 5.8% and was favorably impacted by approximately 1% due to the timing of Good Friday. We have a commitment to gain market share to our offering of a wide range of products and providing relevant value-added solutions which is reflected in the continued success of our Global Animal Health Group.","Turning to Medical; our Medical sales was $640 million in the second quarter, representing an increase of 7.5% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 7%. And that 7% included 7.1% growth in North America and 4.9% growth internationally. We are very pleased with our overall Medical sales results, which is primarily driven from solid organic growth from existing large customers.","Technology and Value-Added service of sales was $103.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of 4.9% with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 3.0%. In North America, Technology and Value-Added Services had internal sales growth of 1.7% in local currencies, or 2.2% growth when normalized for again certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales. Our international sales of local internal sales growth was 9.3% and was strong across the board, highlighted by double-digit growth in both financial services and dental software revenue.","We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the second quarter. Specifically, we purchased approximately 744,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $71.69 per share representing approximately $53 million. The impact of this repurchase on our second quarter results was immaterial. Also at the close of the second quarter, Henry Schein had approximately $147 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. If we look at our operating cash flow for the quarter, the operating cash flow was $287.8 million compared to $228.7 million last year. We continue to believe we will have strong operating cash flow for the year.","Now I'd like to walk you through some additional details on our plan restructuring. We recently announced this initiative to rationalize our operations and provide significant expense efficiencies. Periodically we look to reduce costs particularly following a number of acquisitions as we have done in the past. Accomplishing this to a coordinated effort is the most efficient meanings to reduce and utilize cost optimization.","As we noted last quarter, we looking at opportunities to augment our technology solutions generated improved efficiencies across the business particularly with redundant activities resulting from prior acquisitions. In an asset to create a lean organization there will be some headcount reductions that may also include consolidation of certain warehouse and other activities in order to eliminate such redundancies. Although we always consider what is the benefits significant and up to one of the amount of resource and attention and cost that is associated with these transactions.","These actions will allow us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure and for new initiatives that we believe will drive future growth under our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan. We expect to record onetime restructuring charges in 2018 of between $45 million and $55 million on a pretax basis or $0.22 to $0.27 per diluted share. These restructuring charges primarily include severance pay, facility closing costs and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restricting plan we expect savings from these restructuring initiatives to have an average payback and about 18 to 24 months after the completion of these efforts.","I conclude my remarks by noting, raising the bottom end of our 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range at this time we are not a able to provide estimates for the impact of total cost related to the planned Animal Health spin off in our 2018 financial results, therefore we are not providing the corresponding GAAP guidance. Note of that 2018 guidance is based on current revenue recognition standards and we do not believe that the impact of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 will be material to our results.","So 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is now expected to be $4.06 to $4.14. A reflecting growth of 13% to 15% compared with the 2017 none-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.60 and this is versus with our prior guidance of $4.20 to $4.14 per share. The guidance includes costs related to our previously announced one-time cash bonus to slightly designated staff members and excludes costs related to the restructuring and plan spend-off of the Animal Health business in 2018.","2017 non-GAAP results exclude cost related to taxes associated with U.S. tax reform legislation a loss associated with Henry Schein divest mature of the equity ownership and E4D technologies and a litigation settlement expense in 2017. The guidance assumes that end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions. Also our guidance is what continuing operations as well as completed our previously announced acquisitions and does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. This guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are consistent with current levels.","Following the close of the Animal Health spin off Henry Schein expects to deliver the EPS growth for the remaining consolidated Henry Schein business in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. We expect to update our full-year guidance for the remaining businesses once the spinoff closes, so with that I'd like to turn the call back over Stanley.","Stanley Bergman","Thank you very much Steven. Let's review some business highlights from our second quarter 2018 results. In our general business, we of course are pleased with our 4.7% internal sales growth in local currencies, in our North American general consumer merchandise business. This is the highest quality growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2015. This growth in part reflects a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2017. We continue to believe the end market is stable, and we have benefited from market share gains.","North America dental equipment internal sales in local currencies grew by 6.2%. General equipment sales growth was solid with a number of our key manufacturing partners in the second quarter of 2018, including Teva, Linmark, and Adec. With respect to dental equipment sales in North America, we continue to make good progress in the second quarter, and have been pleased with the overall product line ramp in the U.S. as part of our strategy to offer our customers a wide selection of choices to meet each of the nation's unique practice needs.","Looking at our equipment categories, local internal North American CAD\/CAM sales were up 35%. Overall, North American high tech equipment sales were relatively flat, since strong CAD\/CAM sales growth was offset by soft digital X-Ray sales, imaging sales, we believe the soft digital imaging sales are primarily due to higher market penetration. Although we expect this market still be a very solid market in the years to come. On a global basis in local currencies, CAD\/CAM sales grew by more than 28% that's on a global basis and our dental implants business grew at approximately 5% on an organic basis.","Looking at international business, we believe the end markets in Europe including Germany, our largest European dental market are stable. We are benefiting from our dual market approach in offering full service as well as telesales and e-commerce distribution capabilities in many European countries. In understanding the specific needs of our customers with practice size and focus with the general dentists or specialists and delivering solutions for those needs, we create closed relationships with our customers. I think this is such a key component part of our success, and really needs to be appreciated and understood by all of our constituents.","In May, we announced the launch of our SLX clear aligner system, and we have been very pleased with the progress today. We just started taking orders towards the end of the quarter, so we are still early in our launch process. But feedback to-date from customers and KOLs, the Key Opinion Leaders, network has been quite positive. The goal of a clear aligner solution is to reduce overall treatment time, while improving practice efficiency. We believe there is significant growing global market potential for aligner products, we see this market are still growing nicely, and we look forward to building our aligner business as we launch our system in the United States to a great extent through the balance of 2018, and we expect to expand in new geographies in the earlier part of 2019.","Now, let's talk about the Animal Health Group. We are pleased with the global animal health sales in the second quarter particularly North America with normalized internal local currency growth of approximately 11%. Our team is working diligently to prepare for the spin-off of our global animal health business and the simultaneous merger with their first choice to create and noted earlier in the conversation with First call. While we are working towards the goal of closing money in the calendar 2018 it is possible that the closing may slip into the first quarter of 2019. We believe that first quarter will provide veterinarians with powerful new platform to grow their practices, of course, through improving client engagement, and of course, driving their health care outcomes with paying.","Following the close of the transaction, Henry Schein plans to continue to pursue our wide ray of growth opportunities in a broad based dental and medical business. As we implement our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan. Our focus will remain on delivering innovative solutions that enable customers to deliver best quality care while increasing the efficiency of our customer's practices, including driving great a patient traffic and enabling technology and equipment interoperability it's very important.","American business also continued to perform well with high single-digit growth in local currencies, our customers are allowed a consultative high touch model which helps they've adapted evolving healthcare environment while remaining nimble and efficient as the enterprises growth. Our strong supplier relationships and supply chain expertise are central to our strategy and have been able to us to grow our America business more rapidly that end market growth.","Our success is driven by differentiated strategy including customer segmentation, now you added solutions in our strong brand equity. We have deployed customize account management models to effectively service healthcare systems, ambulatory surgical centers, emergency medical services, urgent care clinics and independent physicians' offices with products, services and yes solutions that are highly relevant to the practice.","Moving on to our technology and value-added services business, we're now in early July that we closed on our joint venture to for Henry Schein One which is a new dental technology and service company offering one connected technology platform for innovative software, hardware and services. Henry Schein One is integrating our solutions into one practice management system that connects office technology, office digital solutions are seamlessly integrated, share more data and more at automate more tasks.","Our plan is to out of bundle software packages to our customers, starting with implementing demand for office site products into our dentals and easy known software packages. In the coming months we plan to continue to add additional bundle practice management solutions and for example bundling software solutions, such as - for the specialty dental practices. So I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the cornerstone of our strategy and a key differentiator to our business which is our portfolio of value-added solutions.","We have received feedback from investors that the investor community would like to better understand what the solutions are comprised of and how these value-added solutions will have impact on our business results. While many competitors seek to compete on low prices only and often with a limited selection of products, we offer competitive pricing while also providing the broadest array of products and solutions and support that help customers operate in more efficient practice that commissions can deliver quality care really, really important strategy that we've had in place for decades and has worked so well for Henry Schein.","Our high-touch value-added model is focused on four key elements. Education, service and support, software and innovation and finally strong customer relationships are offering expense beyond supplies and equipment to business solutions, technical service digital technology and practice management and clinical solutions.","Our practice management and clinical software capabilities are differentiated by our continued investment in customized tools and investment specific practice challenges, we have an industry leading presence with more than 40% of the income practice group and more than 55% of annual practices in North America using our practice management solutions platform and a significant installed base of many international markets and many of these international markets. This software is in fact bound to efficient practice operations for how the clinical records of processing e-claims for credit card processing inflation reminders.","We take a holistic approach to develop the systems, system interoperability the practice to ensure that efficient and seamless end-to-end workflow for instance enterprise is designed to work with more than 40 medical solution software solutions and dozens of equipment suppliers solutions and systems and it also easily shares data with other solutions providers used by practice.","Through Henry Schein One, we expect this portfolio for continue to expand and particularly the offering of powerful tools to help the practitioners operate more efficient practice so that the practitioners can focus on providing with best of clinical care. This is across another key elements in our early approach that benefit our connections loyalty program pulling privileges with customers elect to partner with Henry Schein for a majority of their annual consumable merchandize equipment purchase to award our customers with services that are highly valuable to them. In fact, approximately 60% of our North American dental consumer sales including DSO sales are associated with the connections program.","Benefits of the program include exclusive discounts with our loyalty program, customers receive exclusive discounts and competitive pricing on consumable merchandize and equipment exchange for volume commitments; really important to understand those often miss, the pricing we give our customers is a real advantage. Guaranteed response fundamental pay generally on service technicians will be made available same-day for emergency repair services for our connections to customers.","Customized practice analytics, the data we collect from our practice management solutions we are able to customize reporting based on specific practice operations and help vendors improve efficiency and the cost of key by-products event generate increased patient traffic. Last year alone we have used more than 5,000 of these customers customize report with our dental customers helping better physician, those practices competitively. We're supporting filling analysis, new product procedures such as dental implants, orthodontics and digital prosthetics and enhancing patient communications to name a few.","In our services, our elite customers all time and internal VIP account representatives who failed to provide one core convenience to the patient with systems with product needs or across special services. We have over 4200 highly trained field service consultants supported by other 2200 service sales representatives that stay a brisk of market development and 100s of new products, services and technologies that are introduced to the market each year.","Our goal is to provide customers with extensive array of consumer momentum, pharmaceutical equipment and value added services from software to financial and office design services all delivering higher level of customized service and support. These field sales consultants are supported by specialist focus on different practice sites, specialties equipments and software and the largest and most effective tele-sales organization in the business.","With that, operator, we'd like to open the call to questions.","Carolynne Borders","Ray, let's go ahead and start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys, and congratulations on the nice improvement in the dental numbers. Steve, on that dental point, I guess my question is on the general consumable side, any further color you can provide as far as did market strengthened during the quarter, was there any change in DSO versus your private practice business, and maybe any commentary around general consumables versus some of the specialty stuff?","Steven Paladino","Sure. So I don't think the market really changed in any significant way during the quarter. We did take more market share I believe. To be fair, we did have a little bit of an easier comparable last year, but going forward, even post Q2, we did see continued strong revenue growth in the consumable merchandize in North America. So we're executing well. Dental specialties did help a bit, because they were in the mid to high single-digit growth rates. So it was growing a little bit faster than the general consumables. But then again overall I think market is very stable and we are really executing well and taking some market share.","Jeff Johnson","All right. That's helpful. And then as follow-up question, just on the minority interest, you bought out I think the remainder of the vet minority interest shares in a couple of different businesses, when was that complete? Is the minority interest line we thought about $6 million reduction, is that a fair way to think about going forward?","And the corollary on that, if it is it looks to me like embedded in your guidance then is that margins may be down a bit still in the second-half of this year. We were thinking they might be closer to flat. So can you maybe help us connect kind of the moving parts there on buying out those minority interests and how to think about margin over the back-half of this year? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Sure. The benefit from minority interest will be a bit greater in the second-half because it's basically composed of two areas. The first is the Henry Schein Animal Health buyout of the minority interest, which is only a partial quarter benefit because we did it during Q2. I think it's sometime in the April or early May timeframe we did it. We completed it. So, you'll get a full-quarter benefit in Q3 and Q4. And the second piece of it was related to what we did at the beginning of this year, we bought out BioHorizons. So that is the full-quarter benefit in Q2. But we do feel like we can continue to get that benefit again going forward on a full quarterly basis. Margins have a lot of different moving parts. So we may be a little bit lighter than we originally planned on operating margins. But we still feel good with the overall business and the overall growth. And that's why we are raising the bottom end of our guidance.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you.","Stanley Bergman","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. So maybe on just pricing environment in general, I mean how would you kind of characterize it against the separate sub groups of sort consumables specialty consumables, instrumentation on the dental side? And any notable differences U.S. versus international? Just teasing back to kind of the margin commentary?","Stanley Bergman","I think, Ross, it's fair to say that pricing pressures are there to some extent. Of course, the internet provides a vehicle for an exchange of information. I don't think results involve orders going to online retail as per se. But there is a little bit more openness on pricing. I wouldn't say it's material. But what this does to save time is offer us an opportunity to talk to the customer where price is important in our corporate and other competitive offerings of certain manufacturers. Certain manufacturers are responding generally to the competitive pricing. And this is both in dental and medical. I wouldn't say it's that much in the pharma side of the animal health. But in medical and dental, I think the manufacturers are understanding that in order to maintain or growth their market share, there have to be a competitive way this product that is not really massively innovative. And so - and this is marginal, but I think in the end, as we drive more high margin products and value add services, I think we will continue with expanding our operating margins, of course, in conjunction with the efficiencies that we are bringing to our business driven by an implementation of more technology.","Ross Muken","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Your line is open.","John Kreger","Hi, thanks very much. Stan, can you just maybe go back to the comments you made at the beginning of the call about the new strategic plan for '18 through '20? And just maybe expand on that a little bit to the extent that you are willing. What's new in the plan versus the prior three years? And is there anything specific in there relating to medical since you've made a couple of big moves in dental and animal health? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Yes, let me just go quickly through the medical. We are - first we are committed to human healthcare essentially from a high level strategic point of view, 18% of GDP is expended on healthcare, two third of that in the non-communicable diseases area which is essentially driven by and can be reduced by wellness intervention program. This has always been at the heart of Henry Schein's medical business. The alternate care environment that displace the wellness and prevention to take place moving out of the hospital the surgery center, and this is an area we expect to continue to advance. Of course, organically we should very good growth there. We have some very good opportunities ahead of us. Sometimes a bit more lumpy, but essentially this business has done well for years now. And we expect it to continue to do well.","And inorganically, there are opportunities to add to that platform I think some profitable businesses that service the alternate care site. So we remain optimistic. As far as the strategic plan is concerned, there are three major planks. The first is to continue to drive efficiencies and make our distribution offering more attractive to our customers. I am not sure this is the time to deal with it but because of time. But Carolynne or Steven can take you through the details. There are many many component parts of this. Some are just an extension of what we had in the '15, '16, '17 strategic plan. Other planks are greater focus on new operating, expanding the operating. Of course, I think what is important here is understanding of way technology is heading and how to use to technology in our business.","Lots and lots of technological opportunities we can't afford them all, but we have to focus on what is relevant. And I think we have some very, very good plans there to increase the efficiency and the effectiveness of our distribution business. So second is expansion of value added service. I would say a significant down payment of that towards that goal is the creation of Henry Schein One where we are offering not only leading practice management system in this country and abroad but also the demand generation software in combination with a practice management system for small, midsized, large, for institutions, dental schools. And the goal here at the end of the day is to increase efficiency in the practice, help with clinical services, make it more efficient and drive traffic into the dental office. So that's a key part of second strategy but also a huge number of value added services that we will be expanding on or that we are doing to continue to expand on and add to in the years to come. And the third is advancing our brand equity. We think the Henry Schein brand is well known. It's trusted. We think we can advance in that regard on our private brand other exclusive products and in particular on the specialty side where we have made some terrific advancements on our own brand products either with manufacturing on behalf, or we where we are vertically integrate.","So, lots of opportunities in advancing high margin products under our own brand or brands that we have a control over as well as exclusive. And we are working with many manufactures in that regard as well the whole brand equity strategies of attraction to many manufactures. So it's those three areas advancing the core distribution business, focusing on value added services and advancing our own brand strategy. None of these are new strategies. These have been put in place several years ago. And it's a matter just advancing and providing significant focus which is the reason why we believe we need to spin off the animal health business which had a different need for focus different concepts, different opportunities. And with the cash we are going to generate from that spin off, we will be able invest in both the Animal Health and Medical and the Dental business on a global basis.","John Kreger","Very helpful. Thank you.","Stanley Bergman","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Thanks for the taking the question. Stan, just wanted to follow up on that. I mean clearly with one and a quarter billion dollars which area seems the most effective in medical or dental? And would that be domestic or global?","And then for Steve, Animal Health business remains very strong, can you give us a little color on the competitive landscape and did you say that it could - the spin-off could slip into early 2019?","Stanley Bergman","Thanks, Jeff. The first question, what we can do with the money? So what we will do with the money will be very, very simple; similar to what we've done in the past. Some of it will go towards buying shares back. That's the way we return cash to our investors, it's worked out very well for us, it's relatively cash-free - cash effective way of getting cash into the hands of our shareholders, and as I said, it's worked well.","The remainder, there will be a little bit that goes into working capital, but I don't think much, because we expect to be significantly cash flow positive. So the majority will go into investing, and investing only based on strategy opportunity, but also the best return on investment opportunities in the short to medium term. I would say this would be in the medical and dental space, geographic expansion, greater market penetration on the distribution side, value-added services, for sure, we think that the Henry Schein One platform presents huge opportunity to expand our presence in the digital community, specifically in regards to getting patients into the dental office. We have a small dental plan already in there. We think we can add to that and a number of software and other opportunities as they relate to the software area. But then, and of course, the specialty area as well, and adding to that specialty platform, areas that although we may sell the products, whether it's medical orthopedics or diagnostics or specialties like dermatology, which is doing well, aesthetics, and greater variety of products, specialty houses to the platform, the opportunities are endless. And the question is focus as our Vice Chairman, Jim Breslawski always says, we could do anything but not everything. And so, we will be focused on the most strategic but also on the most accretive opportunities for the short to medium term.","Steven Paladino","Just on the second part of your question, Kevin, so no real significant changes in the competitive landscape that are going to people's attention. And the second part of your question on Animal Health, we did say that it is possible that the spin closes in early Q1. We are still shooting for late Q4 closing. The thing that we really can't predict with great certainty is how long it will take the registration statement to go through SEC and how long it will take to respond to whatever comments the SEC has. And that's why - because we can control that, and that could be a reasonably short process or a longer process depending on the questions and comments. So for that reason, we say it's possible, it could slip into Q1.","Kevin Ellich","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. In Animal Health, did you see an incremental impact at all from weather-related items, I guess, in the quarter from the delayed flee and tick season, should we anticipate continued strength in the third and fourth quarter, if you could give us a sense of the quarterly profession and the underlying demand trend you're seeing that would be great. Thanks.","Steven Paladino","Sure. Probably we had a little bit of help given the warm climate in parts of the country, but what that does is it typically means that the flee and tick season is the longest season that is starting earlier. So hopefully that helps a little bit. But overall, we still feel good about the end markets and our ability to gain market share in Animal Health, and the flee and tick season will continue in Q3 and a little bit into Q4.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then, on clear aligners, in particular, can you just speak to kind of the opportunity, how you kind of stack-up related to the competition there and then what sort of contributions are embedded in your expectations near-term, or is it more of a longer-term contributor? Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Right. Erin, we're not providing specific guidance, nor we're contemplating significant profits in the near-term. This is a launch of our new products offering, which is based on the technical first motion 3D system. It uses a unique combination approach with an intuitive and supplied treatment process, whether from minor crowding or cases requiring more extensive work to correct the issues. Our system addresses the correction upfront with the motion 3D system, a three to four month process before the aligner is introduced.","As a result, we believe fewer aligners are needed, so this is part of a comprehensive solution, and we believe it's a competitive solution, some of which requires - very often 60 to 86 set of aligners for complicated case versus ours, which we believe will be 20 to 30. And we believe ours is competitively priced. The bottom line is it's a new idea, it does use aligners, we believe we have a significant number of KOLs that are supporting this. It's been well-received, but it is just one product offering, one value-added solution within hundreds within Henry Schein. We're very optimistic. Orthodontic team are highly capable, highly qualified, they are with us for a long time. So we're not giving projections right now, but are very enthusiastic that our whole orthodontic offering - as part of our general specialty offering of implants and bone regenerations and endo will continue to move along in a nice way, and is the basis - in general the basis for our statement that we'll be moving to more over time to more high margin products that I think will provide greater stickiness to our customer base. So, no specifics on contribution of profits, we're just excited to launch, and extremely happy with the reception that our orthodontic team have received from the KOL network. But remember it's not a pure a aligner product, it's a combination product that we believe will in the end be very effective and will continue to be well-received as more patients use this product.","Erin Wright","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.","Steve Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, Stan and Steve. So couple quick ones here, you mentioned 18 to 24 month pay back on the new restructuring once completed; I guess just to clarify, are you able to comment on whether you're capturing any material benefit from restructuring in the back-half of 2018 in particular? Does it have a positive impact on the 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance?","Stanley Bergman","Yes, on that, there will be some benefit we believe, but it's a little early for us to quantify the benefit that will be in the second-half, because again the completion and the timing of those activities is still being calculated. But we do expect some benefit in the back-half of the year as well as going forward. And it has very attractive returns even at the high-end of 24 months still very attractive returns, and it's important for us again to do a combination of lower the cost structure as well as free-up follows for alternative investments.","Steve Valiquette","Okay. And then just a quick gross margin question, the commentary hasn't really been consistent over time, at least from some of your competitors on whether the dental gross margins are higher on consumables versus dental equipment, just remind us where you shake out on that comparison again, just without giving a specific numbers, but just which ones higher versus the other, it seems like the commentary is kind of been mixed over time and throughout the industry, but just curious where that stands for you guys today. Thanks.","Steven Paladino","Yes, for us, we have been consistent. Our gross margins are higher on the consumables and equipment. They're both very good gross margins, but relative to each other the consumable's a bit higher. So I'm not sure what you're hearing from other industry sources but we consistently said that.","Steve Valiquette","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen from Leerink. Your line is open.","David Larsen","Hi, congrats on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about your plans to drive higher gross margin like in sell of Henry Schein brand products, some tech investments in other areas. Thanks.","Stanley Bergman","Sure, David. Thank you for your question. I'll give you some high-level and maybe Steven can provide more color. First of all, it follows really our strategic - the three kinds of our strategic plan; on the distribution side, the goal is to move to high value products. There are some branded manufacturers working with us, some private brand manufacturers working with us, in other words, not valid for the customer our products where we are receiving manufacturer support and driving margin at the same time, driving efficiencies in the business to drive up the - drive down the cost and drive up the operating margin. So, all of that does include the bucket.","The second bucket of course is our value-added services. And on the dental side, a huge focus on Henry Schein One; this team has been busy now for over a year working on integration or the plans for the merger, and now the integration, had not been focused on sales much, they've not been focused hugely on margin management, they are not bringing this significant integration into play. Just with the team last week and it's really exciting, the opportunities to use AI, Big Data, Small Data, some call it, to advance the practice to drive demand for dentistry, working of course with the Internet brands, ownership of WebMD, all very, very exciting opportunities that will drive sales stickiness, but high margin. I think we've indicated in prior press releases that we expect over the next two to three years to generation $20 million.","Steven Paladino","$20 million to $30 million.","Stanley Bergman","$20 million to $30 million of increased profits in this business; our team is very optimistic. And then, the last, the third bucket is our own brand, which includes of course the private brand. And then in the specialty areas, where we manufacture products, but also have products manufactured for us. We are doing quite well in the implants area, we expect to do - there are some strategic additions to that platform hopefully in the not-too-distant future, both in implants and bone regeneration areas. We are doing very well in those two areas.","On the endodontic side, bringing innovation to market, but also having a very good position in the lower price also a good product, more generic endodontic treatment arena, lots of opportunity there. And then the orthodontic space as we described with aligners, but also with our core orthodontic offerings, which had really done very, very well from an innovative point of view, and are now gaining market share in this country, and we expect growing market share abroad. So you all add all of that together and that's what's going to drive, but of course, that brings us altogether across the company is the advancement of digital technology interoperability, bringing all three businesses together, lots and lots of opportunity to really have a one-stop-one-Henry Schein-solution to our customers that I think will drive out margins. And also, the connection between our dental business and our medical business in advancing our wellness and prevention should all in the end drive out margin. This is a carefully thought out plan, no difference of previous years or previous strategic plans, and we will execute piece-by-piece and expect to continue as we have for the past 23 years as a public company driving up sales, operating margin, EPS, and yes, cash flow.","Steven, anything to add?","Steven Paladino","Yes, I think you covered it pretty fully. The only thing maybe I'll add is on the Henry Schein One. Those synergies that we noted, $20 million to $30 million by the end of the year three, synergies are very high percentage of those, revenue growth and getting a deeper adoption of some of the services on to our software use of platforms, so that will drive higher revenue growth within the technology segment as well as higher margins as those products get adopted.","And similarly on the specialty products, we are growing the specialty products faster organically than the non-specialty products as we just talked about earlier on this call, plus there is opportunity for inorganic growth from time-to-time in the specialty area. So we feel good about continuing to move the mix towards higher margin products. We recognize that that's important for our overall financial model. So those will be only few comments I had in addition to you, Stanley.","David Larsen","Thank you, Steve.","Stanley Bergman","Thanks for the question, David.","Operator","We have time to take the last question from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan David Block","Hey, guys. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the questions and fitting me in. Maybe two; first one, I'm going to actually attack on Steve's earlier question on dental gross margins, I know you said consumable higher than equipment, but can you comment on call consumable specialty versus at a basic, just curious because it does look like specialty has been and may continue to just grow faster than basic. And then, I've got a quick follow-up.","Stanley Bergman","Yes. The specialty margins are very, very good, especially in more matured businesses; for example, our implant businesses are quite profitable, and expecting to become even more profitable over time, we are investing - have continued to invest heavily in expanding the platform inorganically and through more efficient production capability. So I think that's an area that has done well for us.","The endodontics is more profitable and also not as profitable as the orthodontics, but much more profitable than the core distribution of dental products in general; lots of opportunity there. And orthodontics was relatively early in the game, but the profits are pretty good. We will not say, \"Early,\" we had been the businesses for about a decade, but we had really seen the benefits from our adjustments in terms of management KOLs in the last few years, but the margin is good and is expected to be greater. So on balance, this is the business that is much more profitable; the specialty areas and our core business.","Having said that, remember, a key part of our core business is also to sell traditional products to those specialists. And that is also a profitable business. And generally those specialists have a bigger wallet to spend money on - for example, equipment, and yes, software, and then I would add one other thing, we are also advancing our software businesses in these areas. We announced - still they're not closed - our investment in very successful orthodontic software business I believe that has the largest installed base of orthodontic software to supplement our endodontic; very good installed base, I think the largest, and likewise with oral surgeons.","Jonathan David Block","Got it, very\u2026","Steven Paladino","Jon, just one other comment, I just want to make sure if I understood your question; my comments on gross margin has been higher on consumables. It's true even after you exclude specialty product. It becomes greater on the gross margin benefit, or it's true even excluding these specialty products.","Jonathan David Block","Got it, very helpful. And a follow-up, Steven for you is, can you just talk about at a high-level where the margin compression maybe coming from. And I'm just curious because the 6.1 adjusted internal growth was one of the stronger numbers in a while, and then you also had some of the higher margin dental consumables that came back this quarter. So wondering if you can call out a division or an area where some of that year-over-year margin impression came from? Thanks, guys.","Steven Paladino","Sure. Well, clearly it's on the gross margin side. And there are couple of factors that we are continuing to invest in as we get future growth that goes into gross margins. So for example, on equipment gross margins, our service technicians that due to repair and installation of equipment is shown - that expense is shown as part of cost of goods sold. And as we make investments to expand the capabilities, especially since we expect to significantly grow our equipment, that's having some impact on the dental equipment gross margins.","Similarly, in our technology business, support - technical support for technology is a significant portion of technical support that is also part of cost of goods sold in the technology business. And again, as we make investments in that area, in anticipation of the ramp with Henry Schein One, you are seeing some impact on those two areas. You have to make the investment price to the actual sales coming. So that's why you are seeing a little bit of the impact on the lower margin this quarter. And hopefully that will be very success as we get additional volume in future quarters.","Jonathan David Block","Very helpful, guys, thank you.","Stanley Bergman","So, Operator, I think we need to end the call now. So let me make some closing comments. We are of course pleased with our results for the first-half of 2018. We continue to advance our intellectual capital and the value-added solutions that we offered to our customers. And I would say driven by a highly motivated team Schein, spent a lot of time in the field in the last quarter, from Asia to Europe to North America, and our outside morale is really good.","This is a key differentiator in our go-to-market strategy. The fact that our team is so highly motivated in advancing plans to improve on our customers, practice efficiency, provide them with tools, to provide better clinical care, and our customers rely on us as trusted advisors to understand their challenges and pain points. We are offering practitioner solutions and services to really help them management practice and achieve their goals. We have a lot of exciting strategic initiatives underway. As part of our three-year strategic plan, I believe we are highly focused; the team is motivated as I said, and I believe we are well-positioned for another successful three years to execute another successful strategic plan.","So, thank you for joining us. Thank you for your interest in Henry Schein. If you any further questions, please feel free to contact Carolynne Borders, in Investor Relations, at 631-390-8105. Steven is also available at 631-843-5915, and looking forward to speaking to you again when we report our third quarter numbers and results performance in November.

The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 4, 2015. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.","I ask that during the Q&A portion of today's call, you limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up before returning to the queue. This will provide the opportunity for as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour we have allotted for this call.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter financial results were solid with a quite strong internal growth in local currencies as we continue to gain market share in each of our four business groups.","As detailed in the news release we issued this morning, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations, and in particular those in Europe. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced our consolidated sales growth by 6% and reduced diluted EPS by $0.06 compared to last year. Steven will speak about this in greater detail during the call.","Yet, looking beyond currency exchange factors, the global market we serve, we believe, continues to be healthy this quarter, and we saw that the previous quarter. And despite some challenges in our International Dental business \u2013 and this is quite selective, it's not a general issue, our bottom line results also were solid despite the impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar. And we were pleased today \u2013 we're again pleased today to be reaffirming our guidance range for the 2015 diluted EPS.","So, in a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments. But first, Steven, can you review the quarterly financial results? Thank you.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2015. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $6.9 million pre-tax, or approximately $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third quarter 2014 conference call.","Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release, reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will be discussing our results as reported, and also excluding these structuring costs, as we believe the latter is more reflective of our performance.","Turning now to our Q1 results, the net sales for the quarter ended March 28, 2015 were $2.5 billion, reflecting a 1.4% increase compared with the first quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.4% growth in local currencies, and as Stanley just mentioned, a 6.0% decline related to foreign currency exchange.","In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.8% and acquisition growth contributed 2.6%. Again, you can see the details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our news release.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 6.6% and expanded by 8 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring costs, which we believe is the most appropriate measure, our adjusted operating margin for the first quarter of 2015 improved by 36 basis points to 6.8%. If you also exclude the impact of acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses, our margin expanded by 33 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2014. This expansion primarily resulted in improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales as we leverage our global infrastructure across growing sales.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8%. This is also on a non-GAAP basis which excludes restructuring costs, and compares with 31.2% for the first quarter of 2014. The lower tax rate is due to the implementation or continued implementation of tax planning strategies and higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rates. We expect that our effective tax rate continue to be in the 30% range for the remainder of the year.","Net income attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2015 was $103.4 million, or $1.22 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.3% and 3.4% compared with the first quarter of 2014. However, again excluding restructuring costs in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $108.4 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, and that represents 6.2% and 8.5% respective growth compared with the first quarter of 2014. Again, as Stanley mentioned, foreign currency exchange did have a negative impact to us in the quarter and it was about $0.06 of EPS for the quarter versus last year.","Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the first quarter. Our Dental sales declined by 3.6% to $1.3 billion. This 3.6% decline consisted of 3.3% growth in local currencies and a 6.9% decline again related to foreign currency exchange.","In local currencies, internally generated sales growth increased 2.7% and our acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.6%. If we look at the 2.7% internal growth in local currencies, that consisted of 4.4% growth in North America and 0.2% internationally. If I give you some additional detail behind each of the North American and international businesses, the 4.4% growth in the North American business consisted of 4.4% growth, the same number, of dental consumable merchandise, as well as slightly higher, or 4.5% growth, in dental equipment sales and service revenue.","If you look at the 0.2% internal growth in constant currency in our international business, that included a slight decline of 1.6% in dental consumable merchandise and 5.4% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. The 1.6% decline in our dental consumable merchandise was primarily reflected in three markets: the Australian market, the UK market and our German market.","Turning to Animal Health, our Animal Health sales were $684.3 million for the first quarter, which was an increase of 4.6%. This included growth of 12.4% in local currencies and 7.8% decline related to foreign currency. Our internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.5%, and acquisitions contributed 7.9% to the growth. If we look at that 4.5% total worldwide growth, it included 1.3% growth in North America and 7.4% growth internationally.","The Animal Health growth rates reflect the impact of certain products that switch between agency and standard sales. This quarter, however, it was not material. It was less than a 1% impact. But it also reflects changes in manufacturer relationships in the veterinary diagnostic category, which we've discussed on previous conference calls.","We normalize for both of those two situations. And when you normalize for that, the group's internal growth rate was 4.5% and in constant currencies was 10.1% and the internal growth rate in North America goes to 13.6%. So we believe that these growth rates more accurately reflect the ongoing strength of the Animal Health business and we will continue to report results of our Animal Health business on the same basis, again, to show the performance on a clearer basis.","Our Medical sales were $443.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 11.6%. This consisted of 12.5% growth in local currencies and a 0.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. Internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.6%, and acquisitions contributed 0.9% to growth. The 11.6% internal growth in local currencies included North American growth of a strong 12.2%, led by large group practices and integrated delivery networks and growth of 1.5% internationally.","This is our first quarter that we have results that include a full quarter of agency revenue resulting from our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. And you should note that agency revenue under this agreement is running approximately $1.5 million per month, so approximately $4.5 million for the quarter.","If we turn to our Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $85.7 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 5.4%. This included 8% growth in local currencies and a 2.6% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we had internally generated sales growth of 7.9% and acquisition growth of 0.1%. That 7.9% internal growth in local currencies included 5.9% growth in North America and 17.3% growth internationally.","We continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the first quarter. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 542,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $139.67 per share, which translated to approximately $75.7 million. The impact of this repurchase in the first quarter was not material. At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $224 million still authorized for future repurchases of common stock, and we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for 2015.","If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, the operating cash flow for the quarter was negative by $26.7 million, but that compares to a negative $55.2 million in the prior year's first quarter, and as most people know, our first quarter is typically negative because of working capital movements. We continue to believe, though, for a full year, we will have strong operating cash flow.","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 41.2 days. That compared to 40.8 days in last year's first quarter. And inventory turns was 5.3 turns, which compares to 5.6 turns last year.","So, finally, I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows. For 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with our 2014 results.","Again, assuming the strength of the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, we expect 2015 adjusted EPS to be towards the lower end of that range. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And, as you may know, we do not hedge against that exposure. Also, our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs related to the planned initiative to rationalize the company's operations and provide expense efficiencies. And it is also, as always, includes completed acquisitions or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions.","So with that, let me turn the call back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, Steven. So, let me review our core business groups starting with Dental. In North America, consumable merchandise sales growth of more than 4% in local currencies indicates that patient traffic to dental offices continues to be strong, although we do believe that we did pick up market share. Importantly, equipment sales and service revenue returned to healthy growth during the quarter, up 4.5%.","Looking at International Dental, internal equipment sales and service remained solid at more than 5% in local currencies. And by the way, the full impact of IDS is expected in the next quarter.","As Steven mentioned, we saw a decline in consumable merchandise sales in our international businesses, but we remain confident about the long-term success of our international dental strategy.","The IDS the biannual International Dental Show in Cologne in March, we did experience the typical slowdown of purchases before the show, leading up to the show, and that softness was offset by gains in other countries including France and Spain.","As always, IDS 2015 was an exciting gathering of dental professionals from across Europe, and many equipment manufacturers used the occasion to launch new products. We look forward to the positive impact of IDS during the next few quarters.","During the first quarter, we entered into a multinational distribution agreement to bring the latest 3D printers from 3D Systems to our laboratory customers. The two products we'll be selling are leaders in the high-fidelity precision 3D printing arena and will be part of our digital dental laboratory offering, which includes 3D scanners, software, installation and post-sales support. This agreement is yet another example of our commitment to complete an integrated digital dental solution in the operatory and, of course, in the lab.","Now, on the Animal Health side, once again this group posted double-digit growth in local currencies in both North America and internationally. We saw particular strength in the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as North America, except in the diagnostic category in North America.","Just after the close of the quarter, we completed our acquisition of scil animal care, which I discussed at some length during our last quarterly conference call. In addition to fortifying our animal health equipment capabilities in North America and Europe, the scil animal care professionals will be expanding our diagnostic products category and working to gain market share for our animal health diagnostics partners, including, of course, Abaxis and Heska. We are pleased thus far with the Abaxis and Heska product lines, and we look forward to further market penetration and success with both of these excellent manufacturers.","During last quarter's call, I mentioned a new software product called Axis-Q, which automates the workflow of diagnostic tests, eliminating the manual input of codes and automatically returning results to the electronic medical record in the vet office. We've made good progress here. There is good advance awareness of this product, and we are on track to launch during the current quarter.","So, again, just like our Dental business, we are very excited about the progress that is unfolding in our Animal Health business both in the United States and abroad.","So, on the Medical side, sales growth in this group was excellent and exceeded 12% in local currencies. This reflects continued progress with large group practices and the IDNs, the integrated delivery networks, our up-market, that's the very large accounts, and our mid-market, the midsize accounts. Growth also includes a full quarter of agency sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health.","Our collaboration with Cardinal Health is proceeding well. Our sales teams have continued to make customer presentations as a combined selling organization and the reception has been very good generally. We just had our national sales meeting of the combined sales forces and it was really \u2013 the morale, the excitement, the enthusiasm was quite remarkable. And we expect to have the integration substantially completed this quarter now, the second quarter, as we originally planned.","So, let me conclude my business overview with some remarks on the Technology and the Value-Added Services groups. This group of businesses continues to perform very well. International Technology and Value-Added Services posted double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies as has actually been the case every quarter for more than two years.","The advanced technology, products and services sold by this group, of course, also provide a platform for further enhancing sales opportunity to customers across all businesses. Very profitable sector of Schein, but also lends enormous stickiness to our relationship with customers on the consumable, equipment, financial services and other business opportunities.","So before we open the call to questions, I'd like to highlight a few awards and rankings we recently received and really as a recognition to the terrific work our team has done.","In February, Henry Schein ranked number one on the Fortune List of the World's Most Admired Companies in the wholesalers section for healthcare, that's the healthcare industry category. This is the second consecutive number one ranking for Henry Schein and the 14th consecutive year we have been named to this list. We also ranked first in all nine subcategories within our industry.","In March, we were named as the 2015 World's Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute. This was the fourth consecutive year Henry Schein has been chosen by Ethisphere and we are one of only 132 companies honored this year and the only honoree in the healthcare products category.","In April, we were named as one of America's best employers by Forbes Magazine with a rank of 203 out of more than 3,500 companies considered. This is the first such list from Forbes with the rankings based on independent and anonymous employee surveys. We take great pride in this ranking as it is based on the fieldwork with employees responding candidly about the employer.","And yet perhaps from a financial point of view, the most exciting of all, effective March 17, Henry Schein was added to the S&P 500 Index. Inclusion in this iconic index is recognition of every Team Schein member's unwavering commitment to helping healthcare practitioners operate more efficient, successful practices while delivering the highest quality of care.","Collectively, I think these four prestigious, yet very different recognitions send a powerful message to our team and our customers about the strength, integrity and accomplishments of Henry Schein and no doubt will continue to result in good returns to our investors.","So, with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. I would also like to thank our over 18,000 Team Schein members across the globe for the hard work and diligent efforts during this quarter and the quarters before.","And now, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","This question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Steve, I was wanting to start maybe with you on the International Dental business and the consumables softness there, just any more color you can provide as far as what may have caused that and how we should be thinking about those three markets you called out, specifically over the next several quarters.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Well, I'm not sure there's a lot of detail. The three markets that caused the decline were Germany, Australia and the UK markets. Germany was just a little bit of sluggishness during the quarter. There was some product movements in Australia, the UK that maybe also contributed.","I think that what we believe is that there's no trend here, that we're looking for a bit of a pickup in International Dental merchandise for the balance of the year. And I'd just like to be cautious for a bit of a pickup, so it'll be a modest improvement I think.","But I think what we're really also happy with is the equipment side. Equipment despite an IDS year was very strong at a little over 5%, 5.4% growth. And while the typical markets, including Germany, is definitely impacted by the IDS market, we did see strong equipment growth in France, in the UK, in the Netherlands as well as Spain and Portugal. And at least the pipeline shows that it was a good IDS year and we should expect good growth of equipment across the board in International for Q2 and beyond.","So, I don't think, Jeff, there's something that's a trend here. I just think sometimes you see a quarter that's particularly soft or strong and it's just kind of the ebbs and flows of the markets.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Fair enough. And then, also news today on one of your larger competitors doing a pretty sizable deal here in the North American vet market. Just any takes there on \u2013 was that a competitive deal that was out there in the market, kind of how you may or may not have looked at it and any thoughts on the changing landscape that exists as of today?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jeff, it didn't come as a surprise. We're aware of it, and we, at this point, don't think we should comment on the financial aspects of the transaction, but we're aware of it. Obviously, our business, I think you know, is companion animal center focused primarily. In the U.S., it's really a companion animal business and an equine business. Australia, New Zealand, it was split, both businesses, both \u2013 sorry, both sectors, companion animal and the large animal. And generally in Europe, it's primarily a companion animal with some large animal. But essentially our business is slightly different to the business that Patterson acquired today.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of Evercore ISI.","Michael A. Cherny - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys, and nice job on the quarter given a lot of the headwinds you faced. So I just want to dive in a bit to the Medical business. If my model is correct, this looks like the best organic growth quarter you've put up in North American Medical in a long period of time. As you think about those underlying trends there, obviously partnering with Cardinal and their business can help. But can you just talk about maybe some other nuances that you may be seeing relative to both underlying market growth versus where you think are areas for potential share gain that may be showing up in numbers now?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think we may have discussed this on previous calls, but to refresh those callers who have not really participated in our previous calls, about a half a dozen years ago or so, we commissioned two studies, two strategic reviews. One, to take a look at the specialties that would be important for our business, those specialties likely to grow and would fit in well with our model. And at the same time, also conducted a study on the organizational methodology that will be used for delivering healthcare.","And so out of those studies, we decided to focus on certain sectors in the medical arena and also formed our healthcare services group, which was focused on IDNs, large group practices and these multiple locations under common management type entities. And I think our work has been recognized. I think it's clear in the marketplace that we are delivering well on our commitments with regard to these newer kinds of entities.","And so we are picking up business and have been picking up business, but now actually fulfilling the orders. From the time we pick up a large account to the time we actually fulfill the orders, it could be as much as a year or so. So we have been speaking for a while about us doing well with these larger accounts, the IDNs, the \u2013 as I mentioned, these different kinds of practices, and I think this is where the underlying growth is coming from, as well as a focus on certain specialties.","Michael A. Cherny - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Stanley. That's helpful. And then just on the private label approach, can you talk about maybe across the three major segments where you're seeing the greatest areas of traction on private label? What type of customers really prefer that product versus more of the traditional branded, and what are the kind of qualitative growth areas you're seeing and opportunities in that front?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. First of all, Henry Schein's philosophy has been one of being committed to national branded manufacturers. So essentially \u2013 I don't know the number today, Steven may have it \u2013 but well over 90% of our business is in branded products.","Generally, we will come out with a private brand when the product is commoditized. Rarely are we the first to come out with a private brand; we'd rather work with the branded manufacturer. But I would say some of these group practices on the commodity-type sales, the less technique-sensitive type products in Dental are looking at the private brand. But I think our percentage of private brand sales in Dental has been quite static for a long time.","The Medical side \u2013 there was a greater movement specifically on the commodity, the infection control type products, to the private brand. In this case, I think we're also a bit of a follower in the marketplace. We generally work with the branded manufacturers until there is no option.","And on the Animal Health side, there's some advancement in the area of generic drugs. But again, we tend to have very close relationships with the branded pharmaceutical companies, and the areas we're making progress are on surgical-type products, instruments, et cetera.","At the same time, I think you know that we do have a number of exclusive products, whether it's the Colgate relationship in the U.S. and a few other countries, and these products are driving our \u2013 these relationships are driving our sales quite nicely, although we work with all the branded manufacturers generally in every market.","Michael A. Cherny - Evercore ISI","Those details are very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo of Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, thanks and good morning. Stan, I just wanted to follow up on the Animal Health question for a second. I mean, I understand your business is largely much more companion based versus large production animal. But I'm just kind of curious, do you have a preference for companion versus large production? I think you do, and maybe if that's the case, could you maybe discuss some of the differences between those two customer classes as you see it and why one may be more attractive versus the other?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. First of all, Glen, the makeup of the businesses we've owned to-date have been largely companion animal, except, as I mentioned, the countries \u2013 Australia and a couple of other countries, New Zealand, Ireland, a few others. So that's where we've been. That book of business is generally very similar to our existing customers. These are practices, generally SME, small, medium-sized enterprises, namely our customers. But there are a growing group of consolidators. But the consolidators generally are multiple locations, multiple smallish practices under common management. So that group of customers has all of that in common.","Generally, on the agricultural side, it's not the small practitioner or the midsize practitioners buying the products. To a large extent it is businesses that are buying the products, of course pursuant very often to a prescription issued by a veterinarian. It's a different business. I'm not saying it's a bad business, it's a good business. I could tell you the business we're in, we're very happy with and we see lots of runway.","I think there are opportunities in the large animal space. Obviously, from a strategic point of view, we all know that there's going to be a greater demand for protein over time. Whether the demand will be in this country or abroad, different people have ideas. Obviously, the developing world presents the biggest opportunity.","So I would say there are opportunities in both markets, and we are very confident that we can continue to grow our companion animal business and make some entry into equine but also into select markets in the large animal production area. I think we do quite well outside the U.S., for example, in the dairy space.","Go ahead. Sorry?","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. I'm sorry to cut you off, Stan. Maybe just as a follow-up to that, could you maybe give me some broader thoughts with respect to the acquisition outlook across your three businesses, because, I mean, obviously part of the growth has been acquisition-driven and the company has done a great job sort of integrating those. But now that you have like, for example, in the animal health space players like Patterson and AmerisourceBergen out there very aggressively looking for acquisitions, is it impacting multiples at all? And maybe if you could just wrap that answer into just an M&A outlook answer a little bit more broadly.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, short of being precise, which we try not to do, our pipeline remains quite constant. Mark and his business development team have much more in their pipeline than they could possibly execute on, not because of capital needs, but purely because of integration challenges. Always \u2013 it doesn't matter, you can buy the most perfect company, great management, great systems, great outlook, there's still work in integrating. And I think that's what we've done so well over the last couple of decades. So we have a robust pipeline.","We generally do not participate in books that are put out by banks. We have, we've bought companies, but generally the deals we do are where there's a personal relationship, where things have been worked out well in advance because a family would like us to buy out a percentage of the business, they want to keep one family member engaged, they want to keep some management engaged, they want to remain in the community. These kinds of deals are the kinds of deals we're the most comfortable with. We have no shortage.","I think the pricing on some of these book deals that have been put out have been very, very high and there's no need to participate in that sector. We have, and when prices become very high, I think you'll see Henry Schein not participate. Having said that, when we do participate, generally, I think the community knows that we close on the deal.","So I don't know if I can be any clearer than that. Steven, I'm not sure if you can be any clearer or say anything more.","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Yeah. No, I think you covered it well. Certainly, acquisitions will continue for us. We have completed acquisitions our whole history as a public company, for 20 years, and as Stanley said, the pipeline is very full. Without commenting on any specific ones, we also are disciplined in our approach because there is so many opportunities, so we don't want to pay multiples that we consider to be, even if it's a good company, not a good transaction if you pay too much for it. So we feel good about our acquisition strategy going forward.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob today. Steve, I think you said in your prepared remarks that organic or the same-store operating margin metric that you give was up 33 basis points in the quarter. I think that's one of your better performances in quite some time. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on what drove the operating expense performance in the quarter and how much of it might have been the result of some of the earlier restructuring actions that you've taken?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Well, as everyone knows, it's a key metric for us that we look at internally, as well as report on externally to shareholders. We do believe that there's more opportunity for margin expansion. Certainly, the restructuring activities will help that and did help that a bit in Q1. And this was \u2013 if you look at operating expenses, operating expenses, when you back out again the acquisitions and the restructuring costs, drove most of it, operating expenses as a percentage of sales. So it's something we want to keep pushing on because it's very important to us. It's very important to our model. And we think there's lots of opportunity to continue to improve that. So, we're going to keep pushing for the balance of the year and thereafter to continue to get that margin expansion.","Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then I just wanted to go back to the Medical segment performance for a second. I understand you're obviously still working on completing the integration with Cardinal, but have you had time to get a sense of where you could potentially leverage Cardinal's scale and maybe purchase products more efficiently? And any kind of update on what the synergies from this partnership might ultimately be?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Well, maybe I'll start. So, we're still in the early stages of the procurement agreement with Cardinal Health. I think both organizations feel very good that there's a lot of opportunity. We do believe that there's a win-win, that we'll be able to buy product at lower cost than we could buy from third parties because of Cardinal's scale on certain products.","But to quantify right now, we're still trading. We could not trade some detailed information before the deal close because of legal restrictions. So we're just starting that. We've bought a little bit of product so far from them. But best I could say is we're very optimistic that there are benefits there. And as the year progresses, hopefully we can give you a little bit more detail on that.","Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Appreciate the update. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair.","Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is actually Robbie Fatta in for John today. Just a question on the dental equipment growth. I may have missed it, but could you breakout for us what the high-tech growth was versus basic equipment in the U.S., and internationally if possible, and maybe within high-tech, how the CAD\/CAM strategy is working so far?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Sure. This quarter, if we look at dental equipment growth, it really was pretty much across the board our growth. We did not see a particular bump from any particular product category. I think part of that is, when we look at CAD\/CAM, we had such a strong Q4. We're also up against, this quarter, a very difficult comp on CAD\/CAM because of upgrades that happened last year. So really, it was across-the-board growth. It really wasn't any particular category that stood out. And we still feel very good about PlanScan E4D.","And when you look at internationally, I would say the same is true. I think it was weighted a little bit more towards traditional equipment in the international markets rather than high-tech, which is a good sign for the overall market too, because if people are buying traditional equipment, they generally are feeling good about how their practice is doing going forward.","Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on the specialty categories. Could you give you us an update on some of the ortho and implant categories?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Sure. From a financial perspective, our dental specialty sales did grow faster than the overall consumable category. We feel like implants are growing nicely, the market, and we're taking market share there. As well as on the orthodontics side, I think we're taking some market share there also. So, the strategy is working. It is improving our overall consumable sales growth. I don't know if you have a specific comment that you're looking for, Robbie, on that, but that would be the overview comment.","Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC","No, that's great. Thanks very much.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I can add a little bit more to that. We are, Robbie, believe that our \u2013 we've had solid year-over-year sales growth in CAMLOG and BioHorizons. And we really believe that we have two very good platforms that will continue to grow, specifically in the markets that they each are strong in, and will expand beyond that. And we believe that generally the implant market around the world, both in the premium and the value segment, will do okay. And so, we have two good properties which are now working well together under one common management structure will, over time, help us grow our business within the sector and the sector in itself is doing well.","Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. And good morning, guys. I'll stick to two questions as well. Maybe for Stanley, the North American consumable, it was a third straight quarter of over 4% growth there. But the year-ago comp was a little bit easier due to weather. So, if you looked at it on that stacked basis, it stepped down quite a bit. I'm just trying to get your opinion of what we're seeing in the North American market. Is it strengthening even further or do you think the market's taking a little bit of a pause up here after some of the reacceleration we saw in 2H 2014? Just would love to get your thoughts and commentary there.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We did have a tough winter the previous year and this year wasn't perfect. But I think the comps were a little bit weaker. And so I think there is some of that that can be brought to bear when you look at our growth for the quarter. Having said that, we do believe that in each one of our businesses we have great momentum on so many fronts and remain quite confident. Of course, there's no guarantees that we'll be able to continue with this momentum, not only in North America, by the way, but around the world.","So, yeah, I think there's something in the fact that the comps were a little bit easier, but overall, I think in North America the markets are getting stronger and we are in a position to pick up a little bit of market share as well. So you add those two things together and we believe the momentum for the next quarters out looks pretty good.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then, Steven, just a quick on vet, more the numbers. You mentioned the adjusted, I think it was 13.6% North American vet growth that you gave versus the 1.3% reported. I just want to make sure, was that, call it, net for IDEXX? In other words, did it take into account the sales you got from a Abaxis and\/or Heska, or is it just making the adjustment on the gross from IDEXX?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Yes, so just to clear \u2013 it's a good question. We excluded all diagnostic category sales. So we excluded both the IDEXX in the prior year and the Abaxis and Heska in the current year to show, excluding IDEXX \u2013 excluding diagnostics, sorry, what the growth is.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. And you'll do that for you think all four quarters of 2015?","Steven Paladino - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Yeah. We will do that because I think it is a performance metric that's very meaningful to shareholders.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Absolutely. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow back up on a question around Cardinal Health and the relationship. Stanley, I just want to understand this a little bit better. When you talked about marketing together with Cardinal, now that you finally have the relationship. Can you talk about which of their products, if any, you're helping to promote with the new relationship? Are you pushing some of their private-label products? And as it's still early days, it sounds to me like if we look at the hospital market versus what you're saying in the physician and outpatient market, that your side of the market is growing much faster. Can you just give us any color as to what you're seeing for the underlying trends maybe on the utilization side?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, Lisa, first of all, we would not view their products, at least in the Schein context, as a private brand. It is a brand, and we're bringing in an extensive offering, thousands of products. I'd be happy to give you the exact number; I don't have it in front of me. But I know it's thousands \u2013 or Steven can give you the exact number.","So we will be promoting their brand, of course, not only in the medical arena, but also in the dental and the vet space. And we will be doing some purchasing from them on the generic drug side, on the generic pharma side. So I think there's going to be quite a bit of opportunity for them to grow in sales to us and us to gain synergies on the purchasing side.","The physician space, it's hard to get specific utilization data, because it's not really broken out and where does the hospital begin and where does it end and where does the ASC begin and end. But generally, we believe we are well positioned to gain business in the alternate care sector, the physician space, the smaller ambulatory care space and even the larger ambulatory care space, and also areas such as the retail clinics and community centers, et cetera.","So they, of course, will help us with the IDNs. They have many IDNs that they are either exclusive or relatively exclusive and I think they will bring us in over time. Having said that, we have a number of IDNs that we are active in unrelated to Cardinal.","So I think our view that the physician space, the alternate space presents runway for us is reaffirmed as we get more and more into our relationship with Cardinal. And at the same time, we are really excited about the entry they give us into IDNs that probably had never heard of us or, if they had heard of us, didn't understand our capabilities.","What I can tell you is the enthusiasm at our national sales meeting of the combined sales force was something I'd not seen at Schein in a while. The Cardinal representatives, of course, love the company, but the company was really more focused on the acute care side, and we are focused on the physician side, and we have tools that they didn't have available to them.","So, generally, I think this has been an outstanding start. We actually go live this week actually and hope to have the integration completed this quarter. So we're very excited about the momentum, and I think the customer base is as well and obviously the salespeople.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just as a follow-up, how do you view that market from an acquisition standpoint at this point, Stanley? Is there still acquisition opportunities there?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There are opportunities for us in that space. The specialty products to be purchased, we were at one time looking at the software side. Prices went so high in the electronic medical record arena that we decided not to continue. We do own a company in that space. We have relationship with Athena that is working actually very well. But there of course are opportunities on the specialty side. I'm not saying specialty pharma, because we exited that space. But in product categories that focus on specialists, lots of opportunities, actually some very high margin opportunities. And, yes, there's some space \u2013 opportunities with some small distributors, but the opportunity rests largely I think in higher-margin type products.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","At this time, we have time for one more question. And that is from the line of Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, Stan and Steve. Yeah, for me I guess my question was \u2013 you sort of half answered it there, but just a follow-up on the North American Medical, how much health reform and incremental ACA enrollment in early 2015 might be helping to drive the acceleration in sales growth? And I think, also, we didn't really see that really help that much in early 2014 \u2013 maybe it took a while for the enrollment to get going. But I think in the back half of 2014, that probably helped. Does that create maybe a little bit tougher comps, thinking about Medical over the next few quarters? Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I can't give you direct information on the correlation between enrollment and our sales, but it is clear that what healthcare reform is all about is prevention and wellness. Middle class and above have access to primary care physicians, very poor had it through the \u2013 primary care physicians through general insurance and through Medicare, and the elderly of course, and then the very poor had access to primary care physicians through Medicaid. But there's a whole group of people in the middle that didn't have access to a primary care physician. If these people were sick, they would go to the emergency room, but there was no real preventative programs for these people.","Healthcare reform is about providing primary care. Of course, the debate is who's going to pay for it. Is it the taxpayer, is it the government, is it reducing costs at certain areas, et cetera? But that's not as important to us as more primary care will be practiced in this country, in the United States, and so that is good for our business and we can see that the primary care side is gearing up.","Obviously, the cost per procedure, reimbursement per procedure, will go down because it's more about the outcomes as we move from sick-care to healthcare. And we believe that this presents a huge opportunity for our Medical business; this is why we're focused in this space. And we believe that some of those opportunities are already being harvested and we expect that to continue in the future as wellness, prevention becomes a bigger part of the whole healthcare focus.","So I can't give you specifics, but I can tell you why we are so enthusiastic about our Medical group.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","And by the way, was there any change at all in medical pricing trends or is it still overwhelmingly driven by volume demand, just to confirm that as well?","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would have to say that there's probably deflation a little bit. Firstly, I think you've got bigger customers, so the pricing is going down. Remember, it's also easier for us to service these bigger customers. They are less expensive to service than the smaller ones. So I would think because the growing pie of these larger practices and these larger entities, there's price pressure \u2013 they can make a decision on moving to generic and then the branded manufacturers have to often meet the generic price. So to some extent, there is deflation, but I think our business growth is really a market share growth that's cushioning also some of this deflation.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So thank you all for calling. We remain very excited about the businesses that we're in. We're very pleased with the progress being made by each of our four business units, actually in the U.S. and abroad. Our Value-Added Services continues to pay off both from a sales and profit point of view and from a connectivity and the stickiness with our customers. So we remain quite bullish about our business.","And so if you have any questions, please feel free to give Carolynne Borders a call. Carolynne, what's your extension?","Carolynne Borders - Vice President-Investor Relations","I'll be on my phone which is 631-662-4317.","Stanley M. Bergman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. And\/or Steven Paladino at extension 5915 at Henry Schein.","So thank you and we look forward to speaking again in 90 days and\/or seeing you at conferences. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Henry Schein First Quarter Conference Call. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Susan Vassallo, Henry Schein's Vice President of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Susan.","Susan Vassallo","Thank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's second quarter results. With me this morning are Stanley Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company\u2019s business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may differ from those expressed in, or indicated by, such forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.","The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast today, August 2, 2012. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.","I ask that during the Q&A portion of today's call, you please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up before returning to the queue. This will provide the opportunity for as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the 1 hour we have allotted for this call.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.","Stanley M. Bergman","Good morning, everyone. And Susan, thank you very much for that introduction. Today, we are reporting growth in earnings per share of approximately 10%. While we are pleased with the performance of each of our business units, our financial results were somewhat adversely affected by foreign currency exchange, particularly relating to the euro and the Canadian dollar, by general economic conditions and by challenging prior year comparisons related to increased sales from the bi-annual IDS show in Germany. So on balance, if you take a look at our internal growth of the business in total, I think we could all agree that we're doing well as a company, gaining market share across-the-board in each of our business units in this country and abroad. Of course, the euro translation has an impact on the top line and to some extent on the middle, on the bottom line, on the operating margin side, cushioned to some extent by our opportunity to buy products at a bit of a lower price also. And we did have an impact from the Canadian dollar. We have a very nice business in Canada, also gaining market share and very profitable.","But also the economic conditions, I think, in some parts of the world are impacting our growth somewhat. But in general, our ability to gain market share has enabled us to feel confident about reaffirming guidance, which you'll hear about a little later and are quite confident about the rest of the year. Of course, in Europe, our main business is our German business. And with respect to our German business, that -- we had tough comparables because we had a very, very successful IDS show last year. Having said that, we are quite confident with the strength of our German business. There are no major concerns relative to reduction of reimbursement in the German dental market, so we continue to be very pleased not only with our traditional business, but of course, with our Camlog business as well.","Yet of course, despite these factors, we are pleased to be reaffirming our financial guidance. Steven will address that a little later. In recent weeks, we have completed a couple of small-ish acquisitions, I think in total about $60 million. As compared to close to a $9 billion business, it's not material from a sales point of view, but very, very important from a strategic point of view. We have a strategic plan, 2012 to '14, which calls for us to complete certain blank spots. And these acquisitions help us advance the closing of these blank spots and filling them in. And therefore, pursuing the strategic policy and priority that is contained in our strategic plan.","Of course, these acquisitions will enable us to reach more practitioners, but more importantly, in markets that we're not in and in products and services that we need complementary offerings for. And so these 3 little acquisitions are not material in terms of sales, certainly not material in terms of capital deployment, but important from a strategic point of view. And I'll speak about this a little later.","So before I go further, I'll ask Steven now to address the financial aspects and -- of the quarter, and then I'll come back to give you a little bit more color. Thank you. Steven?","Steven Paladino","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to everyone. I'm also pleased to be reporting overall solid financial results for the second quarter of 2012. I'd like to point out that our 2012 second quarter results include approximately $3.4 million pretax of restructuring costs, and that is approximately $0.03 per share. We announced this restructuring on our fourth quarter 2011 conference call. And you'll see on Exhibit B to this morning's earnings release that we have reconciled GAAP to non-GAAP income for this item. We have now completed the restructuring, and we do not expect any further cost from that program for the remainder of 2012.","Turning to our financial performance. Our net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 were $2.2 billion, reflecting a 3.3% increase compared with the second quarter of 2011. This consists of 6.5% growth in local currencies and a 3.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internal sales growth was 4.6% and our acquisition growth was 1.9%. You can see further details of our sales growth that are contained on Exhibit A of our earnings news release.","Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2012 was 7%. This was a decline of 7 basis points compared to last year's operating margin for the second quarter. However, I think it's important to look at the operating margin excluding restructuring costs, which we believe is a more appropriate measure. And when looking at it that way, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter actually improved by 8 basis points to 7.2%. I also like to point out that the current year acquisitions, if we would exclude those because they initially come in at lower margins, until we can integrate and get some synergies, if we exclude those current year acquisitions also, our operating margin for the second quarter improved by 16 basis points and would have been about 7.3%.","If you look at the components, our operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, again, excluding restructuring costs improved by 45 basis points as we continue to control and leverage our expense structure. This improvement was partially offset by a decline of 37 basis points in gross margin, and that's reflected mostly in our global Animal Health business where we have higher sales growth, as well as product mix where our Animal Health sales, because of certain pharmaceuticals, do carry a lower gross margin.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.2%, which is in line with our guidance and is down from 31.9% in the second quarter of last year. We expect our effective tax rate to remain in this 31% range for the remainder of the year, and we also think there's a possibility that it could be slightly lower than 31% for the balance of the year as certain tax saving initiatives are implemented, as well as earnings from lower tax jurisdictions increasing.","Our net income attributable to Henry Schein for the second quarter of 2012 was $98.1 million or $1.08 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring costs, our net income attributable to Henry Schein was $100.3 million or $1.11 per diluted share and this represents an increase of 6.2% and 9.9%, respectively, compared with the second quarter of 2011. I think it's important to note that foreign exchange did have a negative impact on our EPS for the quarter, and this negative impact was approximately $0.03. So if we were just to use the same exchange rates that existed last year in the second quarter versus this year, our earnings would have been $0.03 higher for the current quarter. I think it's also important to remind people that a change in the euro exchange rate, which is our largest non-U.S. currency, a change by $0.10 on average for a quarter would have an impact by approximately $0.015 on our EPS on a quarterly basis.","Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the second quarter. Our Global Dental sales for the second quarter declined by 1.3% to $1.2 billion, but that consists of 2.6% growth in local currencies and a 3.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales were up 2.1% and acquisition growth contributed about 0.5% to our growth. We believe that our overall dental sales growth exceeds the estimates for the market growth for the quarter. If we look at that 2.1% internal sales growth in local currencies in our Global Dental business, it is comprised of 3.2% growth in North America and 0.5% growth internationally.","I'll give you some detail behind those figures right now. The North America 3.2% internal growth includes 1.9% growth in our Dental consumable merchandise business and 7.9% growth in our Dental equipment sales and service revenue. This equipment growth figure is particularly noteworthy as it represents the highest growth that we've had in that category in 8 quarters. And we believe the growth was driven largely by our enhanced focus on this area that we discussed on last quarter's conference call, including enhanced Privileges, promotions and attractive financing incentives.","The 0.5% international internal growth included 3.4% growth in consumable merchandise and a decline in equipment sales and service revenues by 6.5%. Remember that the international dental equipment sales growth reflects a challenging prior year comparison related to the increased sales we saw last year because of the IDS show in Germany, as well as some economic challenges in Italy.","If we go to our global Animal Health sales, they were $586.3 million in the second quarter. That's an increase of 11.4% and consists of 14.9% growth in local currencies, offset by a 3.5% decline in foreign exchange. If you look at our local currency growth, it was 8.7% internally generated and acquisition growth contributed another 6.2%. If we further break down our growth between North America and international, the 8.7% internal growth in local currencies included 14.2% growth in North America and 3.4% international growth. We believe the North American Animal Health growth was fueled by strong flea and tick product sales this quarter. We also believe that we continue to gain market share in our global Animal Health business for the quarter.","Now turning to our Global Medical sales, they were $361.1 million in the second quarter. That's a 5.9% increase and represents components of local currency growth of 6.6%, which was all internally generated and a 0.7% decline related to foreign currency. That 6.6% internal growth includes 7.2% growth in North America and a small decline of 2.2% in international. Again, we believe we continue to gain market share in this business segment. And remember, our North American business represents about 90% of our Medical sales total.","If we look at our global Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $68.2 million in the second quarter. That represents a 9.8% increase, and the components are 10.6% local currency and a decline of 0.8% related to foreign currency. If we look at the local currency growth, internally generated sales were 8.6% and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2%. And within North America and international, that internal growth was 9% North America and 6.2% internationally.","So looking at our stock repurchase plan, we continue to be active in repurchasing our common stock in the open market during the second quarter. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock during the quarter at an average price of about $75 per share. And that represents about $118.3 million of cash. The impact of this repurchase for the quarter was really immaterial to our EPS, in fact, it was less than $0.01 per share.","If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we have strong operating cash flow for the quarter of $178.5 million and that compares to $138 million last year. The components saw improvement in working capital -- that was a key driver -- and we continue to believe we'll have a very strong operating cash flow for the balance of the year and achieve our goal of having cash flow exceed adjusted net income. Looking at our accounts receivable DSO or days sales outstanding, it was about 40 days for the second quarter, and that compares to 40.6 days last year, so slight improvement. Inventory turns for the second quarter were consistent this year and last year at 6.5 turns for the second quarter.","I'll just conclude my remarks by affirming our 2012 financial guidance. We expect the 2012 EPS to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, which represents a growth of 8% to 11% compared to 2011 results. Again, let me remind people that 2012, our fiscal year has 1 less week than 2011. And as always, our 2012 guidance is for current continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact that there may be for any future acquisitions.","So with that summary, I'd like to turn it back over to Stan.","Stanley M. Bergman","Thank you, Steven. So let me review the highlights from the second quarter for the 3 business units. You know we now have our 3 global business units, the Global Dental business unit, the global Animal Health business unit, the Global Medical business unit, which is primarily a business unit focused in North America at this time, and -- or shall we say, the U.S. and then, of course, there's a fourth unit, the 3 verticals, and then there's horizontal units of Technology and Value-Added Services, which is global in nature, but supports our Global Dental, Animal Health and Medical groups.","So let's talk about the Global Dental to start with. We believe that we continue to gain, as noted early in my opening remarks, market share, and I think Steven reaffirmed that, the market share in our Global Dental business during the quarter, with particular strength in the North American equipment business, as we mentioned earlier. The dental specialty markets are important components in our growth, and we recently strengthened our global orthodontic business with the acquisition of Ortho Technology. So we are building a nice orthodontic business. We started out Ortho Organizers, added on a couple of businesses there to expand the offering, and the Ortho Technology gives us more products and certainly more sales. And it's a nice market that's complementary to our overall Henry Schein dental business. The Ortho Technology business offers a complete line of orthodontic supplies and serves approximately 10,000 customers worldwide. So it's a relatively small business with a lot of customers, and the opportunity to increase sales to these customers is there because we have the penetration but we didn't -- in terms of access to customers, but we have relatively small amounts of sales to each of these customers. The business will be complementary, of course, to Ortho Organizers, which we acquired in March of 2009. The business has done very well for us, and that, as our shareholders know, those that are close to us, Ortho Organizers largely serves general practice dentist professionals, while Ortho Technology sells products primarily to orthodontists. So we have a nice mix of customers here that we're now positioned to introduce our broad offering in the Ortho line to.","We envisage multiple synergies between these 2 organizations, including leveraging Ortho Organizers' manufacturing capabilities. They manufacture certain products and do a good job at that and Ortho Technologies' aesthetic brackets and a best-in-class direct marketing expertise, Good opportunity. With this transaction, we are further penetrating what is a $1.25 billion global orthodontics market with a company that has been gaining share for several years.","Ortho Technology is based in Tampa, Florida, was founded in 1991 and has approximately 19 Team Schein Members. The sales for 2011 were $24 million, not a lot in the context of a 9-or-so-billion-dollar Henry Schein business, but very, very important strategically. We plan to promote the company as part of the Henry Schein portfolio of orthodontics companies, as I noted.","In addition, we have a plan to expand our presence in Asia. We've, I think, done very well in North America, of course, in Europe. Asia is a market that presents lots of opportunity, rapidly growing market in terms of population. The middle class is growing, and it's in this context that we made a decision a couple of years ago that we wanted to expand into the Asian market and pursued a joint venture with the Accord company. This transaction establishes our presence in Thailand in a leadership position and can serve as our -- and will, of course, service as our anchor for further expansion in Asia.","Thailand is the 26th country in which Henry Schein now operates. Now of course, Thailand in itself is not that material from a global point of view, but Accord is the premier distributor in Southeast Asia, a long history. We've worked with Mrs. Suchada, the CEO of the company, for almost 20 years in different ways. We know the company very well and the facility, the capacity to do education and work for our suppliers in that part of the world is terrific, and the reputation of Accord is terrific.","The Thai dental market is the fifth largest in Asia. It's estimated to be about $100 million annually. The rest of the Southeast Asia market is about a $150 million market opportunity, again this is from a dental point of view, but it's also growing rapidly. Accord is based in Bangkok, it's Thailand's leading full-service dental distributor. The company was founded in 1976, has approximately 115 team members, including 45 -- almost half of the company represent -- is in the field sales area, and the 45 field and then another dozen or so in telesales, so about half of the company is focused on sales and services 5,000 customers.","Among the many brands Accord carries are a number of exclusives, many -- in fact all of them, were key suppliers of Henry Schein, in general. The company in 2011 had sales of about $15 million, relatively small, but very important in our strategic plan to expand our presence in Asia.","Accord was owned by the Charnsethikul family -- I always get that -- have trouble with that, and Mrs. Suchada is much easier for me to pronounce. We acquired 75% of the company, and the founding family will retain the remaining 25%. Part of our general strategy has always been to enter into new markets, whether it's new products or new geographies, with partners. Accord is operated by Mrs. Suchada, who is in her second term as President of the Thai Dental Trade Association. Ask anyone about Mrs. Suchada in the East Asia area and global dental market, and she will carry huge, huge credibility. And she will continue to manage Accord, and is grooming the next generation of managers as well.","Accord is widely recognized as a solid, solid company with great management. Mrs. Suchada is one of the most respected leaders in the Asian dental community, and enjoys extensive relationships with distributors in other countries and key manufacturers. And of course, we're very, very excited and -- to have entered this joint venture. We have an Asian team that we started putting together about 4 or 5 years ago and are doing well. The joint venture in Hong Kong is doing extremely well. We're the largest player in that market from a dental point of view, and now Thailand, and we continue to roll out our Chinese strategy, which is making progress, but of course, quite challenged. China is a large market, huge opportunity, and we continue to advance our strategy there, too, with the recent Thai acquisition complementing the Hong Kong joint venture.","In June, we held our 17th annual Dental National Sales Meeting and concurrently celebrated the 15th anniversary of creating Sullivan-Schein, which is now known as Henry Schein Dental. Of course, bringing those companies together with mere dental had its challenges. Bottom line is, it's the largest distributor of dental products in the world, very profitable, with a superb management team. 2,000 Team Schein Members gathered in Florida with our key suppliers who attended and did a really terrific job, the largest gathering of its kind in the world, included training and education sessions, valuable opportunity for our sales representatives to share best practices amongst themselves. We had a nice contingency from our international group coming to learn, share best practice, and of course, everyone spending time with our key supplier representatives. Always good for investors that want to get a feel for what happens at one of these events, to have a discussion going on about our suppliers, maybe more of them, 1 or 2, and 3, even more, and find out how well these meetings go. And this meeting was really superb. It prepares us, of course, for the rest of the year and particularly for the selling season, which begins towards the end of this quarter and it's heavy in the fourth quarter.","At this year's meeting, we launched a new program called Likable Dentists. This is a Facebook marketing solution that assists dentists and dental practices in using social media critical to the future of dental practices, to build their brand and engage with existing and prospective patients. Our launch of Likable Dentists is a prime example of our commitment to finding innovative solutions that help our customers' practices evolve along with the times, very, very important, so social media and capitalize on the increasing importance of e-commerce in the dental market.","So very, very excited with what's happening on the Global Dental side. We are, by far, the biggest dental company in the world, almost $5 billion, or just around $5 billion of sales. We're gaining market share, making progress on our strategic plan. We've got a great management team that is aligning behind the strategic plan in a very nice way. And we've got depth of management in all parts of the world and many, many opportunities, lots of blanks in terms of product offerings and geographies, and we are executing, and there's much more to come this year and next year and the following year as we execute the plan.","So let's now turn to the Global Animal Health business. This business continues to make impressive gains in the market in terms of market share and particularly in North America. As our shareholders recall, 2010 was the integration year of this joint venture, it's created the Butler Schein business in the U.S. 2011, we made really good progress in terms of market share, and that progress continues in 2012.","During the second quarter, we completed our acquisition of the AUV Veterinary Services business. I discussed AUV at length during our previous conference call. But as a reminder, this transaction brings us a leading presence in the Netherlands and Belgium and advances our pan-European strategy of providing Animal Health practitioners across the continent with products and services needed to operate more efficient practices and deliver high-quality care.","The key here is that we are almost in a position to go to our major suppliers and say, \"We will take care of your products, major, and of course, other emerging suppliers across Europe as we've done on the dental side.\" So there's some more blanks on the map that need to be filled out. We will make good progress in that area, I'm quite convinced, and we'll create Europe -- we are today, Europe's largest Animal Health distributor, but we will create a unique, unique presence that our manufacturers will turn to, and moving us from a market that is more or less a logistics distribution market to one in which we will bring Animal Health Value-Added Services to our veterinary customers in Europe in a similar way to the way we've done it in North America and on the dental side in Europe -- North America in Animal Health and the way we've done it on the dental side in Europe.","I'd like to remind you that AUV's business currently has an operating margin of 1% and will negatively impact our consolidated worldwide operating margin going forward. No different, by the way, to the Demedis deal of several years ago and I think we've shown very good results there on the dental side. While we look forward to the opportunity to improve margins at AUV over the next few years, we estimate this acquisition will negatively impact our consolidated operating margins for the second half of the year by approximately 10 basis points. Having said this, I think the Animal Health business presents huge opportunity for Henry Schein as the only global distributor in the space, and I think we are creating a terrific asset for -- which all goes towards creating shareholder value.","So now on the medical side. Let me -- our Global Medical business, really 90% North America and really U.S.-based. Our continued impressive growth in that -- in this business during the second quarter, which is on the heels of market share gains now for quite a while, is really due to the increased penetration of the integrated delivery networks, larger group practices and of course, the ambulatory surgery center, as well as solid growth in sales and pharmaceutical products and medical equipment.","I think we've mentioned this to shareholders in the past, we've conducted a strategic plan about 4.5 years ago to determine which areas of this market we wanted to focus on from a specialty point of view and how we were going to access these new emerging delivery networks, the integrated networks to the different kinds of large group practices, ambulatory health care is growing in importance. So different ways to address that. And so the second component part, how to address this opportunity in terms of the way in which practice of medicine is conducted was addressed through the establishment of our health care services group, which is doing extremely well in penetrating these newer kinds of health care delivery networks.","Another recent acquisition was the Modern Laboratory, MLS deal. This transaction reflects our continued commitment to the physician clinical laboratory market, a very important little market, but very profitable and strengthens our position on the U.S. West Coast, which is an area of exciting growth. In fact, MLS is one of the leading distributors in Western U.S. of products and services for the POL, physician office laboratory. The products are laboratory equipment supplies. MLS represents many of the most important suppliers in the clinical laboratory business including serving as exclusive distributor for the Siemens' Dimension chemistry analyzer product on that side of the country and complements our business on the East side of the U.S. Sales were $22 million, but the sales are not anywhere reflective of the huge opportunity from a strategic point of view. So sales are modest, but the strategic benefit is quite large when connected to our U.S. sales and distribution channel, where with this product offering, we will be able to penetrate further into the market.","Having said that, MLS does have approximately 700 customers, 36 team members. The company was founded in 1984 in an entrepreneurial way, based in Bakersfield, California. The entrepreneurs that founded the business will continue with us as is customary in many of these kinds of relationships at Henry Schein. Stan Sherrill, CEO and co-owner, a terrific, terrific knowledgeable individual in this market, will join Henry Schein as the West Coast Lab Sales Manager; and Bob Ward, President and co-owner also a great, great entrepreneurial manager, who will fit very well into our entrepreneurial culture, will continue to oversee their MLS business to the U.S. military bases in U.S. territories. These are nice opportunities to leverage not only the MLS business per se, but leverage Henry Schein's other products into these markets. The transaction also advances our goal of gaining market share and adding knowledgeable key -- a key component part, knowledgeable management through strategic acquisitions within important product areas and niche areas.","So now that's the dental, the Animal Health and the medical global businesses. Let me now turn to -- those are our 3 major verticals. To the horizontal that crosses the business unit, the global Technology and Value-Added Services business unit, that covers the vertical supporting all 3 horizontal businesses. This business is primarily a technology software-related services and also financial services. The performance of this group continued to be solid during the second quarter, with strong internal growth in the United States, bolstered by strategic acquisitions. The acquisition is, again, not material from a sales point of view, not even material from a dollars and cents put to work point of view, capital deployed, shall we say, but much more important from a strategic point of view.","More than 85% of Technology and Value-Added Services revenue is derived from North America at this time. The goal is to expand that globally, and quarterly results include a particular strength in recurring revenue streams on both the technology side and as well as, by the way, on the financial services side of the business. So I think you can see there's a lot of good things happening here at Henry Schein. We're gaining market share. We're focused on increasing our operating margin from our existing portfolio, putting on top of that newer businesses where there's lots of opportunity to increase the margin, and so we are executing on our strategic plan with the 3 global verticals, with a global technology and a financial services, value-added services horizontal working well, I would say that our global services part of the business, that's our distribution, the IT, the human resources, the supply chain, all of that is doing very well as we globalize our business. We've been doing that for the past decade. We have a terrific management team supporting the sales and marketing part of the business and great strategies, and are executing, I think, in a way that is very good. Seasoned management team doing a great job is complemented by lots of additional members of the team who are being integrated nicely in general.","So before we take questions, I'd like to touch on the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding key provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as health care reform. As we all know, there are likely to be changes to this law before it goes into effect. And in fact, this particular legislation will mature, like all major legislation in American history, it will mature over the next decade, but believe that the overriding goal of expanding access to health care with a focus on preventative care in the primary care physician office and alternate care setting, is a net positive for Henry Schein.","Yes, there will be challenges. The first line of defense for many Americans remains the emergency room in the hospital. That will change over time and be moved to the physician office and alternate care setting. Who pays for that is the big debate, but I think it is clear that the physician will play a more important role in the primary care setting, that preventative care will be important. These are all areas that Henry Schein has been focused on now for a long time. And I think we are ideally positioned to advance our business into this new environment that will unfold over the next decade or so and sooner.","While there'll be a cost pressure to contain the use of certain higher-priced procedures, devices, therapeutics, we don't see this having much of an impact in the end on Henry Schein, like -- very similar, by the way, on the dental side where we have our special markets business. Yes, we are dealing with a more sophisticated customer, but a more sophisticated customer is also able to get greater compliance with formularies and the like. And so as the market transforms, I think it will be to our benefit for business, for a business that was primarily business to small business to -- in the medical world to transform into small -- into an environment of business to proficiently run larger enterprises, which gives us opportunity to work with those suppliers that are committed to this market to advance our mutual business. And there is a challenge with the new tax that will be levied on manufacturers of medical devices. The market will adjust over time. But there's a lot of system work needed to comply. There's a lot -- going to be a lot of challenges with customers understanding why prices are going up, not too dissimilar with some of the legislation relative to the pharma industry where we have to track lots going back to who manufactured the product. I think Henry Schein developed very good systems in this area. It was a challenge for the industry, but I believe the Henry Schein systems that we have today are really a barrier to entry for many smaller players. So I think we will see consolidation on this market, both on the distribution side, probably on the manufacturing side, but also definitely on the customer side. And I think we are well positioned to -- specifically on the medical side, but there is even some dental opportunity to advance the business during -- and the changes that will be advanced in the health care arena in the next decade with some significant changes in the near-term.","Of course, we consider the -- there's no doubt we have to consider the general economic conditions in the markets we serve. There's definitely somewhat of an impact. Things are a little different to they were, perhaps 2 or 3 quarters ago, but I think Steven has adequately taken this into account, and reaffirming our guidance in the traditional, conservative way in which he has approached guidance and reconciliation to our internal budgets.","So having said this, we do see a positive impact from the fact that more people are expected to seek routine and preventative medical services, both in the medical world, in the dental world, with more physician activity going to take place, movement away from the acute care setting into the physician space. The higher traffic that will, over time, emerge in the physician space primarily in the primary care area, I think is good for Henry Schein in the long run. Of course, we have to budget changing the dynamics, which is reinforcing one part of the business while sunsetting to some extent other parts of the business, it's all areas that I think our team is well, well, ready to adjust. Any time we have earned significant change dynamics, there are opportunities and there are challenges, of course. And I think we are well positioned to take advantage of that.","We have, I think, a very good portfolio of businesses, dental, medical, Animal Health and geographies. And I think we are well positioned, of course, not without the usual business risk, but I think this management team here has shown over the decades that these kinds of risks can be monetarized for the benefit of our shareholders.","So with that in mind, Steven and I are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a quick question about the consumables business. When I look at what the experience or what you guys posted in Europe, clearly, probably a little bit faster than what I would have expected. And then if I look into U.S., probably a little bit slower than what I would have expected. And is that kind of -- was that in line with your expectations, or were you surprised as well?","Stanley M. Bergman","That's a good question, Glen. I think you really have to be very careful in measuring one quarter as stand-alone. I mean, last quarter, we cautioned that maybe the numbers were a little too high, this -- and it was not reflective of the markets nor of our market share gain. And I think this quarter, one has to be careful to draw conclusions from the quarter as to whether the strength -- the underlying strength of the market is reflected in the numbers. One thing is for sure, we have checked with our major manufacturers, and I think that you can do the crosschecking yourself, we continue to gain market share. And so at the same time, I would not draw a conclusion that Henry Schein is gaining market share, albeit modest market share, but we are gaining market share in the key products. I would not draw the conclusion that because Henry Schein's gaining market share and Henry Schein's internal growth was not as strong as the previous quarter, that the market is really challenged. I think that would be too narrow a view. So it would be very hard for me to predict the next quarter, but I think one has to have a much more nuanced view than to conclude that the first quarter, the market was racing ahead, and the second quarter, it's going in a completely different direction. I think the dental market is a solid market. I speak to dentists. In most parts of the country, they're feeling good. There are parts of the country where they're not feeling as good, and there are parts of the country where they're ecstatic. So we're in a solid business, and I think we have to be careful to draw conclusions from one quarter versus another and take a more long-term view.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I appreciate that. You mind if I just ask one more follow-up question on the Animal Health business? The company continues to post pretty solid results there. And Steve, you've called out flea & tick sales now for a number of quarter. I'm kind of wondering how long can that continue. And then I recognize your comments that you're gaining market share within that business. Maybe could you assess what you think that market is growing organically so we can sort of put it in a little bit better context?","Steven Paladino","Well, on the flea & tick, remember, this is primarily a seasonal product. It will continue through the summer months. And then when it gets to the winter time, it generally tails off. It's a seasonal product, as I said. Basically, the season started earlier this year than from prior years. Again because we had a very mild winter. And that caused parasites on animals to start quicker. It's difficult to measure the overall market. We think the overall market is somewhere in the mid-single digit growth range. And again, we're growing at least 2x that. I'm not sure where the market share is coming from because some of the other big players are also performing well, so I guess it's coming from the smaller players. And right now there's still a lot of momentum in our veterinary business.","Stanley M. Bergman","Glen, just to be sure, I don't know how many quarters any company could sustain 14%. I think that was the number of internal growth rate. So we're not counting on that. We would hope that our Animal Health people continue to gain market share, and -- but I think it's unrealistic to expect those kinds of numbers to be posted going forward on a regular basis. I think because of our unique platform that has come together, we have the widest variety of products. I think we have a great sales organization, terrific delivery, a great brand. And so I think you can expect us to continue to gain market share at this point. The globalization of our business there has huge opportunity. But, I think, to expect 14% growth in any one quarter going forward on a regular basis, I think, is certainly something we can't count on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just digging into your comments about Dental equipment and consumables and looking at the overall internal growth. It seems like you've had continued strength, obviously, in Dental equipment. I was hoping maybe you could share a little bit more detail around the category that you're specifically seeing the most growth. And then taking a step back and looking at the global picture, seems like a fairly wide disparity between the North American equipment growth and the international growth. Just any more insight on the differences there that you could share would be helpful.","Stanley M. Bergman","Well, first of all, Steven is going to give you the categories, but let me just give you 2 macro points. The first is that I think we've pointed out that the -- in our first quarter call, that the first quarter sales were a little bit depressed because some of the backlog got shipped, some of that in the U.S. in the -- or were going to be shipped in the second quarter. That took place. So on the one side, I think the second quarter -- the first quarter was a little depressed, and the second quarter, I think, is a bit more on the positive side than one would expect to continue. On the flipside, you have Europe where we had tremendous growth in our #1 equipment market, #1 by far, Germany because of the IDS and now, we had very good growth, we think, in terms of market share in Germany. But it's on the heels of these comparables. So again, I think one must be very, very careful in drawing conclusions from one quarter to another. And so Steven will give you the exact categories where we've done well, and I'd be very careful to conclude that because we've done well in one quarter, it's a trend. But I think Steven will give you a trend line thinking as well. And we remain, by the way, quite positive about our dental business. We think we have a very good offering on both sides of the Atlantic and have further realigned that offering recently. But why don't you, Steven, talk about...","Steven Paladino","Sure, sure. So our equipment growth by category was pretty broad-based this quarter. In North America, we had very strong traditional equipment growth. Again, we said that we were going to focus on it last quarter. We felt that there were opportunities there in the marketplace. And we were able to capitalize on that. But the leading grower for us was the CAD\/CAM or E4D segment. That was our fastest growing category within the high tech segment. It's been our fastest-growing category for a little while now. We would expect that to continue. But again, I would say that North America was very broad-based on our equipment sales growth. If you look at international, Bob, I think it's important to remember the IDS trade show. This is not unexpected to have a very difficult comparison with the strong equipment sales, especially in the Germanic countries last year in Q2. So that was the primary reason why equipment sales growth internationally was not strong. So it's really the comparison. The other thing that is impacting it is the Italian market. The Italian market, because of the overall economy, equipment is down somewhat in the market. We're actually doing better than the market, both on equipment and consumables, but we still have the reality of the Italian market. So hopefully, that provides some additional color to you.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, it does. It's very helpful. Actually, if I could just follow up on that, Steve. So within the CAD\/CAM space, you mentioned E4D obviously being the strongest growth in North America. Is that, in large part, do you feel because of share shift, or do you feel that this category is finally starting to pick up broader acceptance? And then if I could just sneak one in on Medical, impressive North American growth, especially in this market. I was wondering if you could maybe just parse out for us underlying market growth versus maybe some share shifts within North America and Medical?","Stanley M. Bergman","Yes, Bob, I think what is very, very, very important here is that we don't use these investor calls to put one supplier against another. We have to be very careful. So let me talk about CAD\/CAM. The CAD\/CAM market, globally, has good opportunity. And the market, I think, will grow nicely. I think as dentists understand the importance of this product, there will be more opportunity. Henry Schein was precluded from the CAD\/CAM market in the U.S. for about 2 decades. So we didn't have the product to sell. So we are now selling this product and perhaps our own customers did not buy the CAD\/CAM product until they saw Henry Schein had an offering. We started offering the product, and I'm not sure if it's market share that we've taken from another manufacturer or not, what I can tell you is that for us, we are growing, and we'll continue to grow. We saw exactly the same in the sensor market. Henry Schein, for a long time, didn't have a good sensor. And when we had a good sensor and made it available to our customers, in collaboration with Danaher, the DEXIS sensor, we have done well. And I don't want to talk about whether we're #1 or #2 because depending on how you define it, we are #1 or #2. Is it units, is it sales, is it a quarter? The bottom line is, I think we have grown from virtually nothing in the sensor business to a significant player in the United States, albeit with the support, and terrific support of Danaher, and I think we will do the same in the CAD\/CAM space. This is no different to the chair story, where we didn't have a chair many years ago. And we partnered with Pelton & Crane to bring the Pelton & Crane chair to market. That business was subsequently bought by Danaher. And today, we are a significant player in the chair business, chairs, units and lights. So I don't know if it's coming from somebody else or if the market's growing. To put one manufacturer against another doesn't make sense. What I can tell you is we do very well with CAD\/CAM in Europe. In Germany, in particular, I think we're, by far, the biggest player. And we have a different product in Germany to the one we have in the U.S. And what's important is the service behind it, and the value that we, as a distributor, can bring to our customers. The product is important. I think we have a very good product here. We have a good product in Europe as well. The most important thing is how does that product fit into the practice and what can we do to help the practitioner run a better business so they can provide better clinical care. And I think we do that part better than anyone else. As it relates to the medical marketplace, well, I think I've covered it in my remarks. Four or 5 years ago, we undertook a study to determine what specialties would be important from a product purchase point of view and from a value-added service point of view in terms of selling services to the customer. We also conducted an in-depth study on the areas we needed to beef up within Schein to service the emerging areas of dental delivery -- of medical delivery. And we created a health care services group. I think that group is the best in the marketplace, not because it's a Schein group. There was -- they struggled 3 years ago, 4 years ago when they started out. It was quite frankly, the GPOs and the big groups didn't even know who we were because we were servicing the small guys. Today, we are well known in that area, and I think our team is doing a good job. And I think we're taking market share across the board, not only from one distributor, but I think in general, because the marketplace realizes that although, yes, there are hospital suppliers that could offer in theory the full line, we have unique capabilities. And after one distributor or another is tested, it's understood that Henry Schein has tools that are great in this area, but they're not as great as they're going to be. We're investing a lot of money in this area.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","Roberto Fatta","This is actually Robbie Fatta in for John today. Just to go back to organic growth, realizing that the first quarter was maybe a bit of an anomaly and the second quarter isn't really indicative of a trend, is it fair to say that growth will be in between those numbers going forward, maybe in the 4% to 5% or maybe even a little bit higher than that range, or what's an appropriate expectation for organic growth going forward?","Stanley M. Bergman","Robbie, the one thing one cannot do -- and it's not you only, but it's Wall Street in general, we cannot give you any guidance within basis points of the market share growth and how we expect to do. The bottom line is, analyst data doesn't exist for dentistry. There is so much being written in this area, and it's all over the place within a range. So I think we can conclude that dentists are doing quite well relative to the marketplace. I think one can conclude that there is a growing demand for dentistry, the public is becoming more and more aware. Are dentists going to be subject to some price pressure and therefore, may be looking for lower-priced products? Some of them will be. Are they going to look for more generics, which carry a lower selling price but a higher margin? Yes. The bottom line is we are investing in dentistry because we believe this is a great industry, lots and lots of upside in this country and abroad. To give you a precise number as to whether it's going to be between last quarter and this quarter, I think, it would be irresponsible. How could anyone give you that answer? We don't know. But what we do know is the trends are okay. Dentists are feeling good. They are under price pressure. There are certain plans emerging that are bringing more traffic to sit in their chair, albeit at a lower price. Capitation is alive and well. The growing group practice movement is out there, although some of the practices are doing well, others are not. I think a large part of Henry Schein's growth is coming from the group practices. But they're under pressure, too. There's private equity going in there, they want lower prices. Bottom line is, I think Henry Schein is positioned to take advantage of these dynamic changes on the heels of a market that is relatively stable compared to where it was, for example, in October 2008.","Roberto Fatta","Fair enough. And if I could just ask one more on margins. In the second half, can you frame for us the impact of your other recent acquisitions? I know you talked about AUV being about a 10-basis point hit. Can you give us a sense if on a consolidated basis you still expect some expansion in the second half?","Steven Paladino","Yes, the other acquisitions, because of the size, really, will not be significant to the operating margin. It's really the AUV which, if you remember, was about $270 million in revenues. And we did say that will be about 10-basis points impact. Remember, we don't look at that as a negative. We will see significant opportunities with AUV to increase their operating margin. We feel that it will prove to be a great acquisition over time. Right now, it's right on plan to what our expectations have been. And again, we look at it as it's resetting the base of our operating margin. So I think other than AUV, the current acquisitions don't really move the needle enough. And again, we do expect to get operating margin expansion in the second half of the year also.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Guys, was the vitality in the North American Dental equipment largely a function of the backlog position you had exiting the first quarter, or did you see some better new order trends in the period? And then how did the backlog shape up exiting the second quarter? And then Steve, any chance you could break out the impact of the IDS show on the international dental equipment side?","Stanley M. Bergman","So Brandon, I think we covered this also a couple of times on the equipment. First of all, in last quarter call, we said that the number was artificially depressed because of our backlog. And I think we played that out. Our backlog, within basis points -- I don't have the exact number in front of me, Steven probably has it, if it's worth -- if it's material to even go through that, is not too different to what it was last year. I mean, it's within a range. So basically, the Dental equipment market took a deep dive in 2009, end of 2008, 2009, started recovering in 2010 and '11. And I think we're in the same place today. I think some of the equipment, take the sensors, there's more of them, but that's at a lower price, E4D is growing. I think one quarter, we get a lot more traditional equipment; one quarter, we don't. I would say it's a pretty stable market. There's 2 good things that are working in our favor, one is interest rates are extremely low. We have great deals in that area. I don't think we have any deals that are materially different to others, perhaps it's just we don't mark up our money as much as others do, but it's quite stable and very low prices in terms of money. Money is readily available. I think 90% of all leases are quickly approved, and we've got 5% we got to go look and scrounge and then it's 5% that are not typical patterns in the post-2011 period. Yes, there were -- cash was available much easier prior to 2008 but at a higher rate. Now it's available a little less, but readily available, at a slightly lower rate -- or quite a bit lower rate, shall we say. So I think the finances are there. And then we've got the accelerated depreciation, which is going to help us again in the fourth quarter. So it's hard to tell you exactly what the growth rates are going to be, but it's a positive market. So there's absolute great reason to buy a CAD\/CAM machine. I think there's still 60% on the market that doesn't have sensors. That market is going to go towards sensors -- kind of, if sensors is going to be this year or next year, I can't tell you. I think from a Henry Schein point of view, adding Planmeca becomes a plus. Planmeca is the #1 in the industry for the 2D panoramic and general panoramic machines. These are all exciting areas, so I think this all bodes well for Schein. But again, the trading range we're talking about in terms of growth is so finite that it's -- it would be, I think, it would be foolhardy for Steve and I to give you an estimate.","Steven Paladino","Yes, I completely agree. Just the second part of your question on International. When you look at it on a country-specific basis, again, the Germanic countries was down, but it was expected to be down because of IDS. That was the main reason that reflected the equipment's negative sales growth on the overall international basis. And a smaller reason was really, as I said earlier, the Italian market. The Italian market, we saw declines in the market, and our equipment sales were also -- were declining, although they declined less than the market. So those are really the 2 reasons. We think the IDS is a timing thing. Italy, I think, won't get worse, and hopefully, will improve somewhat over time. So we're feeling like the markets are still relatively stable, and our goal, as always, is to grow faster than whatever the underlying market growth is.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, I'll move on. I believe GSK recently started initial shipments of the flu vaccine for the upcoming season. At this stage, do you have a view on how you expect [ph] the actual shipments to fall between the third and fourth quarter? And then how is your sell-through pricing shaping up relative to last year if you have a view at this stage?","Steven Paladino","Okay. So it's still very, very, very early. So I'm happy to give you our guess, and I really will say it's a guess because we're totally reliant on when we get product from the manufacturers. But my guess is that product will come early similar to last year in the market. So it may be a little bit more weighted towards Q3 than Q4. But really, I would be very cautious on that because we really just don't know, and what we're happy to do on the Q3 conference call, as we've done historically, is we'll talk about what we shipped that quarter and we'll -- since we're releasing partially into Q4, we'll probably know the bulk of what we will have shipped for the whole year. And we always are very transparent on that and provide that detail. Pricing, no major -- pricing is still early also to be -- but I'm not seeing any major changes from pricing also at this time. Again I just want to repeat, it is still very early in the process.","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Marsh from Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Maybe just get you elaborate on 2 of your prepared comments, Stanley, and first is, it strikes me that last November when you gave guidance, you had sort of called out some uncertainties in Europe. And it feels to me that, that's kind of coming to fruition as you sort of talk about it. So I don't think that's a surprise to you guys. I think you specifically said Germany is still very strong, the comps versus last year on equipment are down. But maybe as you think about Germany, Stanley, when you say strength in the market, as you think about that, is that still a business that you believe you can grow at market over the next couple of years? And again as you think about IDS for 2013, is this going to be as big a deal as normal given the environment, or it's always a big deal?","Stanley M. Bergman","Actually, Larry, you're asking a question that we ask internally on a regular basis. I mean, we ask this question at our monthly meeting with our German team and then every third day on the e-mail just to validate the answer. I'm being a little facetious here. But you're in the right area. You're asking a good question. So the only thing I can say, and I don't want to set a precedent in these calls, by the way, for what I'm about to say. All I can tell you is, we develop budgets. They get -- they start being developed, I think, in June or July, right Steven? When do we start up?","Steven Paladino","We're just starting now.","Stanley M. Bergman","Now, right? So we're starting now. And then we have the grand meeting in Europe, I think, is in October, when Steven gets together with all the managers. What I can tell you is the German business is delivering in accordance with budget. No one knew -- and I don't want to start referring to budgets on future businesses because I don't think it's germane to go into budgets on all of our businesses. But the point here that I'm trying to address is, we did expect that something would give, whether it was too high comparables in the previous year versus potential for this year, the foreign exchange issue, perhaps the fact that the Germans were already getting a little excited about having to fund the rest of Europe, we didn't expect any reimbursement adjustments in Germany. That's too politically a hot potato. No one wants to mess around with a dentist reimbursement. It's insignificant. And everyone in Germany takes advantage of this. So it's different to going after hospitals and drug companies. So that was something that we didn't take into account. Having said that, I think the business is growing. I know the business is growing and is more or less in the plus column, delivering in accordance with expectations. We had a management change about 1 year and plus -- 1.5 years ago, which has gone very well. We've got great management. I think there's opportunity to grow on the equipment side, but I think there's huge opportunity to grow on the consumable side. We have a very important equipment presence and our consumable presence is not as good as our equipment because if you'll recall, the genesis of our major part of our business in Germany extends from the former Siemens Dental. And so our team are extremely good at equipment. At the same time, our team is more comfortable sometimes selling $150,000 product or EUR 100,000 product than may perhaps going after the disposables. So we have built plans in, in the last 2 or 3 years to do that. I think there's opportunity to go after the consumable business, the specialty business. So I think the German market is relatively stable, but our opportunity for growth is quite good. So that goes right into the IDS question. I think if the manufacturers continue to come up with good products, I think our major manufacturers, the ones that I'm in dialogue with, seem to have good plans for new products. They launch those new products at IDS. I'm not sure we'll have huge growth, but we'll have growth.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe a quick follow-up for Steve. I just want to make sure I'm thinking of FX right. I think you had said $0.03 this quarter that you fought through. So does that suggest -- in my mind, that's going to be at least $0.03 a quarter, Q3 and Q4, maybe even a little bit more. So you're confirming the guidance is despite this big negative headwind on FX. Is that the right way to think about it? And what am I missing?","Steven Paladino","Well, first on the current quarter. And I'm glad you asked the question because I think -- we did say in the prepared remarks that we had $0.03 negative impact in the quarter purely related to foreign exchange. And that's just the difference between average exchange rates that existed Q2 last year versus applying the current average rate. And just to highlight that, last year, the average rate for the euro, and again, that's our biggest currency, was somewhere around $1.44 or $1.45. And this year, the current average rate for the quarter was somewhere around $1.28. So it's a big movement. And I do think it's a testament to our core business that we were able to still deliver strong growth and fight through that $0.03 headwind. The headwind, assuming again -- and I don't want to predict foreign currency rates because I don't think it's truthful and I don't think anyone really knows how, but assuming rates stay where they are, the impact will lessen because the euro did weaken last year. So if this stays the same, the impact will be lessened in Q3 and Q4. So after saying all that, I'd like to point out again that we feel confident in our guidance. We're trying to be a bit conservative on exchange rates as we sit here today, and we feel confident that we'll deliver our EPS guidance, for the year unless some really unusual thing happens in the world that we're not expecting.","Operator","We have time for one more question, and it comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups here and, Stanley, I hear what you're saying on not wanting to give us growth guidance and to focus on the big picture, I get that. But let me ask one question, if I can try to tease a couple of things out. I think we're all pretty confident that June is when dental demand really started to lighten up in the U.S. At least, that's what I'm hearing pretty clearly in my checks. I know you also pulled a lot of your sales reps out of the field that month for the sales meeting. A lot of those guys went down and enjoyed maybe a week with family in Orlando and that. How much is -- as those sales reps are now back in the field and that, the 1.9% consumables number that we saw in the third quarter or in the second quarter, is that a reasonable level to assume, or should we think about as though sales reps are back and that maybe a bit of strengthening in the next couple of quarters on that consumable side? And then also in Europe, is it fair to think of the European dental market, just in general, staying in positive territory the rest of the year, or how do you read those tea leaves?","Stanley M. Bergman","Jeff, I want to put this as diplomatically as possible because I think you're probably -- you are, I think one of the most knowledgeable analysts in the dental space. We are dealing with tens of basis points right now. And for me or for anybody in the dental industry to give you an opinion on that would be very difficult. Yes, June was an unusual month because we had our national sales meeting. And I think that always takes people out of the field. But I don't want to take that and extrapolate it for the rest of the year because it's a factor. There are other factors, too, positive and negative, mostly positive, I would say. Now as it relates to the growth rate we experienced, to extrapolate that for the rest of the year, I don't know. It would be very, very, very difficult. There are so many factors. Is there a movement from more expensive products to less expensive products? I think it could be that. How are our specialty businesses doing versus perhaps some of the mature products? What I'm quite comfortable with is, we will not lose market share and quite comfortable that we will move into positive. How much positive in market share? I don't know. I don't know if the visits to dentists are really down. What I do know is there was a good traffic into the dental office in the first quarter because of the weather. And my sense is that appointments that could have occurred perhaps a little later in the year were pulled into the first quarter because dentists probably called their customers and said, \"I've got 2 extra days or 3 extra days.\" Let them say it this way, but they found they had 2 or 3 extra days and pulled customers in. By the way, a big driver of that is our Dentrix software, which helps them optimize the use of dental chair time. So I don't know. At the same time, I think the good weather, many say impacted positively on our Animal Health business. At the same time, the Animal Health business, I think, continues to show good numbers so -- I mean extraordinary numbers. So it's very -- we're dealing with, I think, a very narrow trading range. I don't think the market's going to go backwards, but I would be shocked if the market really grew significantly. I think we're in a stable market. I think dentists have cash. They're paying their bills on time. They are more engaged in marketing, going after patients that perhaps they wouldn't have gone after in the past and drawing more patients into the practice. I think that's good for the pie. But there's so many nuanced little differences. So it would be very hard to give you a precise number. Having said that, I do believe it's a positive industry, both in this country and in Europe. Now as for Europe, I think Germany is stable. I think France is stable. I think the U.K. has challenges, but I think we've got a great team in the U.K. -- not that we have a great team -- don't have a great team elsewhere, but this team is, I think, particularly focused right now and is winning. Italy is a problem. I mean, you read the newspaper, it's a problem. And we are the biggest and only national distributor of equipment. So we're going to have a challenge today. Spain is a problem. It's not material, but you add Spain to Italy, and it starts having some impact somewhere at Schein. But you got the anchor of Germany, and I would say Australia is, it's a nice business. I don't know what it is today, it's about 3% or 4% of Schein -- is that what it is, in dental business, something like that? Is okay, but it's definitely a bifurcated economy. The majority of the people are not doing well, but there's a lot of people in Australia that are doing well. So I would say, in my mind, I look at Australia and I say, there's some challenges maybe, but then I look at Canada, which seems to be roaring away. So I could justify many different scenarios. What I can tell you is that I will be quite surprised if we don't remain in a decent, positive environment from a Henry Schein market share growth and translating to actual organic sales. And there's lots of opportunity to manage costs in the business and lots of opportunity to expand into new markets that will generate profits in the next year or so. So I think our Dental business is quite stable to growing. Our Medical business is in good shape. We're gaining market share in a complex market. And Animal Health continues to do much better than we thought.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's very helpful, Stanley. Steve, last question...","Stanley M. Bergman","And our Technology businesses are bringing in nice profits as well. And although the sales are not material, the profits are.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Understood. Steve, just last question then. With regards to IDEX, I'm sure you don't have necessarily anything firm you can say there, but how much business do you do with IDEX outside the U.S.? And how important do you think that is in maybe maintaining that relationship on a worldwide basis?","Steven Paladino","I don't have a specific number for outside the U.S. I'd have to get back to you on that.","Stanley M. Bergman","It's not material. Outside the U.S. is not material. We had -- we work with IDEX in a couple of markets, but the market is extremely fractionalized amongst a lot of manufacturers outside of the U.S.","Steven Paladino","And just overall on IDEX, unfortunately, there's really not any important new news from the last call. We're still waiting to hear what IDEX is doing and what they're doing with the FTC. So we're hearing that sometime late August, early September, we'll hear more information. But I don't have really an update other than that. We feel -- still feel good, very good about our relationship with IDEX. So that's a positive on our side.","Stanley M. Bergman","So I'm sorry, we went over the mark today, but there really is a lot going on in the business. And I think it was well worth the extra 20 minutes or so. So thank you, everyone, for participating in the call. Steven is ready to handle additional calls. You can call Susan Vassallo in our Communications department, Gerard Meuchner in our Communications department. And I think people have the number, if not, just Steven is (631) 843-5915, and Susan, 5562. And please feel free to call. We'll be very pleased to answer questions. I think we're feeling good about the company. I just visited a number of our businesses in North America in the last 2 weeks and spent a little time before that in Europe. Heading to Europe again in the next -- doing some business there in the next month although parts of Europe are on vacation, but the parts I'll visit will not be so heavily on vacation. And the impression I have from our management coming in and out of headquarters and in the field is that the morale is good, and generally, we feel good about winning. So thank you very much for your interest, and we'll be back in 90 days.","Operator","This concludes today's Henry Schein's Second Quarter Conference Call. You may now disconnect."]}}
