We are pleased with our performance as we began our first full years at Fortive. We had a strong start to 2017 by delivering mid-teens adjusted earnings growth above the high end of our guidance in mid-single digit core revenue growth.","All six of our strategic platforms grew core sales reflecting strong volume, gains in market share and accelerated performance in high growth markets. Through the successful deployment of the Fortive business system, for the third consecutive quarter we were able to once again deliver above market revenue growth, margin expansion and solid free cash flow. We are committed to create sustainable long-term value for both our customers and shareholders. Our culture of continuous improvement, disciplined capital deployment and secular growth drivers give us confidence in our future and expectation of continued outperformance for 2017.","During the first quarter we held our first annual leadership conference and rallied our team around Fortive's shared purpose, a special technology for the people who accelerated progress. Our top global leaders gather to review our 2016 performance, benchmark FBS practices and communicate our priorities for 2017 and beyond. We recognized Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Qualitrol and Matco as our top core growth company. Fluke was recognized with our leading innovation award and finally Qualitrol was honored with our CVD Award which is given to the company that demonstrates the greatest achievement across our core value metrics. The conference again demonstrated to me the powers of FBS and culture, the energy around our values and our team's strong belief in our future.","With that I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA net earnings of $209.4 million were up 15.1% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.60 based on effective tax rate of 26.7% for the quarter. Sales grew 4.1% to $1.5 billion reflecting a core revenue increase of 4.9% as all our platforms posted core growth. Acquisitions contributed 20 basis point of growth during the first quarter, partially offset by 100 basis points of unfavorable currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Geographically developed markets grew core revenue low single digits reflecting continued strength in Western Europe and stable demand in North America.","North American growth of low single digits reflected strong performance that Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Matco which was summoned up by Jacobs Vehicle Systems. We continue to outperform in Western Europe hosting high single-digit growth as continued market share gains were realized across both professional instrumentation and industrial technology segments. High growth markets accelerated to low double digit core revenue growth in the quarter with strength across Asia. Double digit growth in China was driven by Tektronix, Qualitrol, and Morgan [ph]. India also grew revenue double digits, primarily reflecting Gilbarco Veeder-Root tender wins and in the Middle East and Africa region Fluke drove high single-digit core revenue growth.","Gross margins was 48.5% reflecting a 140 basis points expansion over the prior year with five out of our six platforms expanding gross margin. Along with the restructuring initiatives undertaken in 2016, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to continue to invest in new product development and sales and marketing. Operating profit margin was 19.2% with core operating margin expansion of 160 basis point driven by volume and margin fall-through. We were able to deliver continued margin expansion through targeted application about BS tools across our businesses and supply chain to drive increased productivity. During the first quarter we generated approximately $121 million of free cash flow and delivered a conversion ratio of 61% which is consistent with our -- with expectancy seasonality. For the full year we continue to believe that our free cash flow ratio will be greater than 100%.","Turning to our segments, professional instrumentation posted sales growth of 2.7%, comprised of 4.6% percent core revenue growth offset by a 120 basis points currency headwind and 70 basis points due primarily to the separation from Danaher. Professional instrumentation delivered 22.1% operating margins with 160 basis points expansion of core operating margin reflecting favorable volume and the amortization, partially offset by 40 basis points of diluted operating margin associated with acquisitions. Advanced instrumentation and solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter with similar performance in both field solutions and product realization.","Field solutions core revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter with both Fluke and Qualitrol posting strong core revenue growth. Fluke mid-single digit core growth results were led by high single-digit growth at Fluke Industrial which is the largest Fluke product line consisting of our handheld instrumentation. Regionally performance was strongest in Western Europe with high single-digit core revenue growth driven by market share gains in the improving macro environment. While small today, the Fluke Solutions grew double digits as eMaint continues to deliver strong growth while eMaint and Fluke condition monitoring to top honors and the plant engineering 2016 product of the year awards in the maintenance software and maintenance tools and equipment categories respectively.","The Fluke team continues to introduce the Fluke Connect digital platform and we will be unveiling our new brand and go-to-market strategies throughout May during a series of customer events across the U.S. You will see much of this at our Investor Day in May where we will talk more broadly about our digital strategy and the industrial Internet of Things. While our digital presence is important in Fluke, I'd like to highlight ongoing innovation focused on building out the contractors tool [ph]. In our networks product line, Fluke released the DFX8000 [ph] cable analyzer which is the industry's first category eight field tester. The DFX8000 [ph] significantly reduces the cost of copper certification for datacom infrastructure contractors and data center network engineers. The Fluke networks team set up in a room and incorporated FBS tools including speed design revenue and lean software development into their innovation process to significantly reduce time to market.","Qualitrol delivered mid-single digit growth and posted strong growth in China for project wins across several of its product lines. Qualitrol solutions for electric grid assets have embraced data centric solutions leveraging its broad portfolio of sensors. As the need for grid reliability evolves, Qualitrol's incorporating data analytics and smart sub-enterprise condition monitoring software to expand their value proposition to customers.","Moving to product realization, the platform core revenues were up high single digits for the quarter led by low double-digit growth at Tektronix. We are encouraged by Tektronix's continued performance in high growth market. Tektronix has driven strong performance in the high growth markets for the application of FBS growth tools, same as utilized transformative marketing processes to identify micro segment to present strong share gain opportunities focusing on these targeted areas, the team has used the FBS growth tool set, to develop personnel base campaign expect successfully generate lead and improve win rates.","Tektronix saw its third consecutive quarter of double digit growth in its Keathly's product line. Keathly's growth has been driven primarily by 3D sensing and consumer electronics, where product is integrated into the production line to test LED, laser diode and flat panel display. This is another example of how our businesses provide a central technology to accelerate customer innovation and bring next generation products to market. On the new products front Tektronix introduced the industry's first 32 gigabit per second protocol where bit error rate test and analysis system. The new BSX series bird scope delivers unique visibility into the underlying root cause of physical layer issues by capturing the exact location and timing of bit errors. The primary applications of the BSX series target the fast growing datacenter market.","Our sensing technology's platform saw mid single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. The team continued to execute on the NAVSEA [ph] project and recently secured the second order associated with this important project for the U.S. Navy. Anderson, Gems and Setra all benefited from General improvements in their key verticals including food and beverage, HVFD [ph] and industrial.","Moving to our industrial technology segment, revenue grew 5.4% core revenue growth was 5.1% for the quarter with acquisitions contributing an additional 110 basis points of growth offset by unfavorable currency of 80 basis points. Both reported and core operating profit margin increased 180 basis points from Q1 2016 driven by Gilbarco Veeder-Root volume more than 250 basis points of margin expansion of Kollmorgen and improved productivity across the platforms. Our transportation technology's platform posted mid-single-digit growth in the quarter with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering high single-digit core revenue growth.","The performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root reflected our double-digit growth in Western Europe and our expectations for low double-digit growth in North America. The outperformance in Western Europe was due to large orders in the U.K. and Germany. The strong growth in North America was driven by an increase in outdoor EMV related demand for both dispenser and payment kits. Global dispenser sales were up double-digits reflecting the strength of our product offering around the world. Further demonstrating our market leading technologies stores partner exclusively with Gilbarco Veeder-Root for both point of sale or indoor and dispensers outdoor to deliver EMV capability to their 400 sites.","Telematics realized core growth of low single-digits in the quarter with mid-single-digit growth outside the US. As part of our restructuring actions taken last quarter, telematics realigned the US sales and marketing teams in order to better position the company for long term success. As a result we expect to see improved growth in the second half of the year in the US. Automation and specialty posted low single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Automation growth of mid-single digits was offset by a core revenue decline in Jacobs Vehicle Systems which is still challenged by the North American heavy truck market.","Within automation Kollmorgen and Thompson both grew core revenue mid-single-digit reflecting increased demand and generally stable end markets. Thompson's growth was broad-based across its key verticals with most of the growth driven by medical equipment in all highway vehicles. Kollmorgen's continued growth reflects increased demand in high growth market and success globally in the robotic medical equipment and semiconductor verticals.","Moving to franchise distribution, the platform posted mid-single digit growth for the quarter with Matco posting core revenue growth of mid-single-digits aided by the Matco Expo which saw a record attendance. The expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see the latest innovation attend training sessions and place orders to further grow their businesses. This year the team introduced its new line of tool storage equipment, revel which is another key innovation milestone achieved by the Matco team. In addition to strong core revenue growth in tool storage this quarter, Matco also delivered strong double digit growth in diagnostic.","To wrap up we had a strong start to the year as we continued our momentum from the second half of 2016. We are well positioned for acquisitions and growth investments due to our current business strength and market leading positions. The Fortive business system is the driving force behind our success today and tomorrow. We are confident in our organic and inorganic opportunities and expect continued outperform as we are advantaged by multiple secular growth drivers. We look forward to explain our growth playbook and outlook in more detail at our first Investor Day on May 18 in New York. We are raising our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $2.68 to $2.78 which includes assumptions for low to mid single-digit core revenue growth.","We continue to anticipate core margin expansion in excess of fifty basis points and are alluring our expected effective tax rate of 28% to a rate of 27% for the year. We are also initiating our second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.65 to $0.69 which includes assumptions of mid-single-digit core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 27%.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Lisa.","Lisa Curran","That concludes our formal comments. Camille, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi, good evening guys.","Jim Lico","Hi, Scott.","Scott Davis","Good afternoon I guess it is for you. It's going to be late evening for us I think. But you know professional instrumentation, everything sounded so good I have to ask a question what wasn't good? What was slow or what kind of fell below your expectations if I may ask it from that angle?","Jim Lico","Yes, I think you're right we were really pleased with what we saw around the hornet [ph], Scott. I think probably, if we were to say one place, probably North America as a region would have been maybe not as strong as some of the other parts of the world we mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the strength of Western Europe. That was certainly true with Fluke and Attack, our two largest businesses within the segment.","So on balance I would saw North America, we like to see a little bit more of improvement in North America as we see the rest of the year play out.","Scott Davis","Now for your products to sell through distribution, I assume that -- I don't - I can't remember what percentage that Fluke sells through distribution. But was any part of this snap back, do you see anything related to some increased comments out there and some inventory-restock, some of the distribution level on get a sense if the sell-through is equivalent?","Jim Lico","Yes. So we see about, I think Fluke's business and channels in the 75% or more range. So they may have pretty good visibility in terms of inventory positions as well number of our other businesses, specifically around Fluke where we get the best clarity data. We do not and really in professional instrumentation, we really did not see inventory build within the channel. So saw through the quarter point of sale, got a little bit better but we didn't see any subsequent addition of the word beyond that, that would have said our inventory positions or anything more but relatively quiet through the quarter.","Scott Davis","Okay. That's all I needed guys. Thanks guys and good luck.","Jim Lico","Alright, thanks Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys, good afternoon.","Jim Lico","Good evening Steve.","Steve Tusa","So just on the kind of organic trajectory, over the course of the rest of year, obviously good start at around 5% this quarter. You were saying in the second half it's going to kind of go to low single-digit. Can you maybe talk about obviously you have the EMV thing out there that everybody is aware of but what about the other businesses. Is there anything in there that is going to swing around from the current rate of growth to either better or worse from first half to second half year-over-year?","Chuck McLaughlin","Hi Steve, this is Chuck. The main thing you're seeing in our guide is that the second half of last year was really strong for us at 3% in the second half. So when you're looking at moderating what is off to a really good start in the first half, that's the main thing that's happening.","Jim Lico","And just as we you know as we sat out I think it's really true from several months ago is that the barcode what the -- in the second half, we still think will get better because we're going to that summertime, and that -- that's some potential upside probably to where we're at right now.","Steve Tusa","So it is a potential upside to where you are.","Jim Lico","Yes, we would think that more upside than down side at this point, obviously it is still early in the year, there's probably some -- we're probably hedging a little bit on what's going on in places like higher growth markets where we've been really strong and that even if that tempered a little bit, we will be in a very good shape in high growth markets in the second half. ","Steve Tusa","And what was G&A up in the quarter or down. ","Jim Lico","I think it is down sequentially and there's a little bit of timing there but we're -- just if you're talking about the corporate overhead or the G&A. ","Steve Tusa","Yes, the G&A portion of SG&A.","Jim Lico","It's flat from last year.","Steve Tusa","Okay, percentage of sales or absolute. ","Jim Lico","At both I think. Well, so it's down a little bit and as a percentage of sales and I think we're flattish from last year.","Steve Tusa","Okay, that makes sense. One last one, the acquisition pipeline, I know it's kind of a generic and you can probably interpret -- probably entered a very generic way what is -- what the pipeline looking like and is there anything that kind of percolating here. ","Jim Lico","And I think -- I think the tone I had in the first quarter was similar to how I view right now I feel very confident we will get some deal done in the year, we certainly been busy in the half year and all those good words around that. We've seen from things transacted at the areas, but I think if we look at the funnel we really believe strongly that the funnel contains a lot of opportunity that would get us that returns we suggest within the realm of how we think about the deal. So we feel publish on the year, and we should have done this for a long time, you never know -- you always work on timing, but I feel strongly we're going -- we will get a few things done for sure.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Hi, good afternoon guys. Obviously a nice quarter from Electronics. I think that we haven't seen so many quarters of high growth. So I'm just wondering we've seen so many in companies, I'm wondering if it's a function of [indiscernible].","Jim Lico","I would definitely think that some of what we're seeing is a better market, I wouldn't any way shape or form suggest that's not it, I do think we've done some nice things around making our own luck, we talked a little bit in our prepared remarks of the good FBS the team is doing -- and you really see that in China, our work we're clearly out growing the market in china, we are doing a really good job, and their high growth market sales were very good, and the has a lot to do with the business, which is semiconductor related but it's also sharing related within conductor.","So these are few places I highlight that are a little bit better above market opportunity and we still think that the opportunity for North America much of that reside in the new platforms, as we launched the new platform we think that that will give us some opportunity second half in North America, we do -- we are on track with that launch. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some other innovations but we're on track for new scope launch. We think we are in a good place, and that will have some impact that will happen that will put us in a good position for 2018.","Nigel Coe","Great. Then secondly maybe for Chuck, the free cash we saw a significant build in working capital. I'm assuming obviously the stronger sale that's natural, but is that because we saw more demand sort of back in the quarter. ","Chuck McLaughlin","No, I think actually what you should expect for us going forward this right in the zone to get us to the 105% conversion ratio we've been talking about. I would look at the trailing 12 and took out the tailwinds for amortizations, we're right on 105% there, so I think we pay out our ICP in Q1 and there's other timing payments, and I think that that's really what you should expect to see going forward.","Nigel Coe","Okay, and then you mentioned Chuck, the intangible -- you saw big drop off in PI. What was that driven by. ","Chuck McLaughlin","10 years ago we bought Tektronix. ","Nigel Coe","Of course you did, thanks.","Chuck McLaughlin","Thanks Nigel.","Operator","Next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon, this is actually [indiscernible] for Julian Mitchell. It looks like we're already seeing some savings from the Q4 restructuring actions. Is this program ahead of plan and what's your expectation regarding the cadence of savings over the next three quarters.","Chuck McLaughlin","I don't know whether it would be a head of plan but it can -- we do restructuring we expect returns within the year, and I think that that's what you're seeing, and in part, but we also have -- we have a good margin fall through and that's not all from restructuring, but I'd say we're right on track where we expected to be.","Jim Lico","The nice thing about growth market, is we really saw really strong FBS work been done in places like our business in Gilbarco, they've been really working hard to be able to deliver more revenue without a lot more investment, I think it's just -- you see these really strong benefits of what we can do with when we -- when we have more volume we don't add capital, we are doing much more productively and so you see a little bit of revenue go a lot -- goes a long way and really those businesses in particular done a really nice job. ","Unidentified Analyst","Understood, and pricing and IT was flat this quarter after being in pressure in Q4 some peers have discussed price increases in the retail fueling market recently, so can you just talk about your pricing dynamics -- the pricing dynamics in the retail fueling market and how those might have changed in the last couple of months. ","Chuck McLaughlin","I think that in Gilbarco we saw some of our bigger deals, as we bundled that it broke down the average price, I think this as we look forward that's moderated somewhat as we forward we expect to return to our seeing our normal pricing as we go forward in the year. ","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. ","Jeffrey Sprague","Hello, a couple of quick ones for me. Jim, I was wondering if you were willing to kind of look -- a little bit on Fluke connect what we might be hearing in the next month or so in terms of size of Fluke count you might be launching or the breadth of the rollout, and we expect it to have a measurable impact on your organic revenues this year. ","Jim Lico","I think that what we are doing in May is we're really doing a multiple city tour with what the eMaint and Fluke select solutions, will be unveiling new brand, we got some branding that we're doing there, we got some branding that are going to market and some integration we are doing with those business to make customers solutions look better. So I think that what you will see sort of continued evolution of innovation it's just kind of continuing at the same pace, more connected devices continuing to come out to just make sure that the upgrade cycle within the portfolio continues. I think what you'll see in conferences is really that sort of whole cost strategy playing out in a way that really makes sense. We are really pleased with the eMaint work and the team there and everything going on, still small business but accelerating well. Looking at it it's really a 2018 story with the current revenue model the way it is, it really it takes a little while to ramp up.","And again as I mentioned I would say we're continuing to see those things happen a little slower than what we -- what we anticipated and I mentioned that the first -- in the January call and that that's really -- that's really continued. So from a building while but that is going to take us a little while to ramp that up to a way to really impact the organic growth.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right, and then just on west Europe you called that out actually on couple businesses. You think that was doing in the market or is that kind of a genuine pickup going on there.","Jim Lico","Well, I haven't watched other sort of talk about Western Europe too, I've found that the market there is a little bit better, the breath of strength that we're having would probably indicate that as well, but work -- we're doing a lot of good things making our own luck, I'd certainly like to work as an example we mentioned the tender wins to Gilbarco, their story is really robotic story, the work that they've been doing with several of the large European robotic OEMs has been really fantastic and they're doing a great job there, so these are just a few examples, we call those guys out in the prepared remarks. Fluke had tactic good quarters too, I think some of that is market but also some of that in the work they are doing, particularly the channel partners to really engage with their marketing efforts to build their portfolio if you will, and I think in balance we're in a good place. And that is why I said I think by and large -- I am saying maybe it is low single digits in Western Europe, I really think for 2017 we are probably more mid-single digits for Western Europe for the year.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question coming from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi everybody, Jim, you said in response to the M&A question, you said you have to get a few things done something to read into that, like more smaller versus one bigger.","Jim Lico","Well, I think getting my words right, you dig them right, I am just saying. I think that is a funnel comment John, I think we definitely see the breadth of the funnel pretty good. And I do think that as we laid out those small, medium and large, how we think about it was large over $500 million in cash capital deployed, medium being under $500 to kind of $100, and then I think under $100 being small. We see a number of things within all those categories. So we feel good that we'll get something done and hopefully we'll be able to talk about more and proper names rather than things, and I think as we get later in the year that will certainly be true. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for that, can we talk about Tektronix for a second. So I think you said high single digit growth, which is obviously much better right. The question I'm wondering I'm assuming that China was much more rapidly growing than that, as you're rolling out this sort of software back down -- Bone for U.S customers kind of holding back such that when these new product launches are pending, because obviously customers must know their stuff is coming, they're going to actually see Tektronix kind of on the collectivism in China holds pick up its growth pace meaningfully in the second half or in the coming quarters. Is that possible?","Jim Lico","Yes, a couple of things, one we actually had a second double digit for the -- for the quarter and they were strong and they were -- they were good in the developed market as well as hyper market, it was just that Europe was much better. I think what will see through the year, is the new platforms just happen to be less a software platform than really a hardware platform, it is really oriented toward customers from or where we tend to have a little bit, we have more customers in North America than we do elsewhere in the world. So it just tends to be more oriented that way. I really don't think it will hold back situation as much that's just an orientation of solutions, and then I think on the high growth market success, it does happen do a little bit with the mix of semiconductor customers to some extent being in those parts of the world, I mentioned that in a previous question and so our success and [indiscernible] portfolio really suggests that we are seeing good strength with several vertical, but that being one of them and it tends to be mores Asia based.","So I wouldn't read too much into that mix, but I do think that just to come back to original question, I don't think we're seeing much hold back, I just think things have been a little bit slower to come back to U.S with the kind of customers we have in the U.S. ","Unidentified Analyst","I just want to press you on that little bit, I guess I'm not completely clear, you telegraphed pretty widely these new product launches and so forth, why would customers be buying now -- why don't they just wait for new products coming in the U.S in a few months I guess that's my point. You suggesting that's not happening, I'm just curious as to why.","Jim Lico","Yes, I think we have a broad portfolio, I think the one we have been clear with is not where the platform necessarily is within the various price points and segments, so we don't get to the but embargo date here a little bit, and so from a customer perspective they just know something new from Tektronix; they don't necessarily know where and so if people have a need right now that they tend to buy a need rather than buy ahead of thing or -- so I think I think -- that's why I don't think we're necessarily seeing much whole back at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just based overall on company trends and the growth rates you saw I guess in China and US. You expect things and realize what you guide is but all our sequel is there are any sort of reason that things may I don't know, not play on kind of but a continuing improvement type of trajectory? That makes any sense? ","Jim Lico","No\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","Order book or anything like that?","Jim Lico","I think things so far have held in so I think from that standpoint every -- kind of think about real time but more than anything I think it's as if we look at three quarters in a row of kind of growth rates in and around the same number; we kind of have a guide out there that thinks at least second quarter will be at mid-single digit and that's better. I think the fodder on the second half is really the bark of actuation as we had indicated and also just -- there is an unknown; if we just -it is early in the year. I think we've been trained early and as we said in the first quarter, it's always sort of let but the back kind of give us a better sense of where reality will be. A year ago we were -- we weren't sure; the second half ended up being better than we thought.","So I think that's just what we're thinking. I think if I were to just maybe just go back to what I said before our high growth markets have been really strong and I guess maybe more cape that might be a little bit more negative would be that things slow down a little bit more there. That would still be performance for us but it would be a little bit little bit less than where we're at right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. Okay, thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Jim Lico","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dean Dray with RBC.","Dean Dray","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Jim, I was hoping you could comment on the initiative to place more of your instruments and inline testing. You called out key fully but I know there's other applications of fluke and how big are the initiative -- More manufacturing automation?","Jim Lico","I would call it more - you're not going to like that. Hopefully we're not get this, we're losing feedback here.","Dean Dray","Sounds like same this end.","Jim Lico","It does. Okay, so we're just getting the feedback. So I'm just going to talk.","Dean Dray","It sounds fine.","Jim Lico","Okay. We really don't have a big initiative. I mean like that is indicated, deeply send a little bit more production cap a little bit more. But I'm down -- we don't have a major initiative event like that and so they've got innovation work we've done it resulting in the results for the for the quarter and quite frankly for the year. ","Dean Dray","You are just not focusing on because we're hearing and seeing more manufacturers put online testing. Is it because your instruments are you their board bench top or handheld?","Jim Lico","Well I think certainly we tended to attack to the example we've tended to stay away from large scale manufacturing cap applications so that that's something we just intentionally done over the -- at Chuck mentioned the ten years we known Tech 9. If fluke we have moved toward from inline sensors and put connect is really an example of that where we have found I pick sensors that allow for the solution so in that case we actually do have in life sensing where we think it makes sense relative to the workflow that exists with Fluke","So beyond that it's really a company-by-company situation but our mission in Fluke is not really be a broad base necessarily center player as much of this is a really technician in the making is perfect and more cool armed them with their ability to troubleshoot and diagnose problems.","Dean Dray","Great. That's helpful. And for Chuck, you just remind us that total balance sheet capacity for M&A at this time?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well we've been talking about deploying over three billion in the next two and a half years and I think that's still good number.","Dean Dray","Did I notice that your euro denominated TP right now is at a negative interest rate?","Chuck McLaughlin","Yes, you did.","Dean Dray","How much more of that you want to do?","Chuck McLaughlin","We're very happy with that program and could extend we expand it and those rates stay there will were intended to do so.","Dean Dray","Good to hear. Thank you.","Chuck McLaughlin","Thanks, Dean","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good afternoon, guys. Just want to follow up on Kollmorgen for a second I think last quarter you had high synergy growth in that business year-over-year and I think that's clear last you mid-single digit but you did talk about the penetration in the robotics. I mean we know it's a very strong growth market right now significantly so maybe if there were more color on Kollmorgen sort of what do you think for the year and is there any other part of that business that's a little slower because I would think that business could accelerate versus decelerate.","Jim Lico","Well, I think you're exactly right. We've had several good strong quarter at Kollmorgen over the last several quarters. I would think about it this way; we've got a nice job -- of robotic in a number of customers that I mentioned on previous question. We've continued to move our around some opportunities what we call mobile robotics, that's really been warehousing and really if as what we used to call our AGV which is really mobile robotic business as robots become more pervasive in warehouses and things like that. Those are clearly opportunities and we think it will it gives us the continued ability to grow the business. We're going up a little bit easier path in the first quarter so we're a little higher this quarter but we think certainly growth there.","Of course that's a business that tends to you win it, you have a design win and then it plays out overtime. So I think it's a little bit longer cycle business. So we think we're in a good position here for the next several quarters and we'll see how we continued design win come and also our customers volume goes; because obviously we also need our customers to be using some of those products more often in order for the business to grow. So we're very comfortable with the growth rate right now. As I said, first quarter is a little bit higher than normal but we think we'll see good growth this year.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. And then I want to ask you that GBS, you mentioned still modestly declining. I would imagine you do you have easier comparisons and mapping and since the year goes on and I think the heavy truck market has shown signs of improvement. So can that business turn here as we go throughout the year as you go throughout the year what's your expectations for GBS.","Jim Lico","What we -- what we certainly in the first quarter have worked it up pretty tough comp. We've got grape business in China there that's continue to perform but we still see, as far as we can see right now we were hearing and listening to what market players are suggesting and things might get better every year. I can I think that probably the hate that's going to occur given that the fairly that he order book so we're still keep some challenges here over the next week or. I Phone five.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Alright guys, appreciate it.","Jim Lico","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel.","Patrick Newton","Yes, good afternoon Jim and Chuck. First question is just on electronic - new platform at least for the second half. Could you tease us with any performance matrix or features that could make the platform disruptive in the market and are we right to think that this is also a market expansion where you'll have an opportunity to target more automotive and embedded opportunities?","Jim Lico","Well Pat Byrne, President of Technology will kill me if I gave too much more away I'm going to platform until we launched it. So I'll let Pat do that once the embargo occurs. But I do think it is an opportunity for us to solidify current market positions and also add some applications that we've not historically done as well in and I think that that's what we're excited about.","Patrick Newton","Oh it's worth a try. And I guess Chuck, one for you is obviously a tax plan discussed by the White House earlier this week. I'm curious that if this tax in its current form or something similar to it that the change the way that Fortive looks at M&A opportunities on a global basis or how you think about signing the bills.","Chuck McLaughlin","I don't think it changes anything about where we would look, what we think they were cost or we the value we see to it that it might change that equation but probably change it for everybody. We'll wait and see if anything comes to the one page that came out yesterday. One way to go - but every scenario I see is creative to us and so I hope they do get something done.","Patrick Newton","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Good luck.","Jim Lico","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Drab from William Blair.","Brian Drab","Hi. I just have one question to left in my list at the moment. Heading into the separation Oh it's down to her if she said that you thought that that you have the EMV opportunity could add about a hundred basis points to grow from a consolidated basis but here just wondering if you look at what. What that's contributing is that more than one hundred in the quarter and what do you expect through this year on a full year basis","Jim Lico","I think yeah I think when we suggested that it was certainly with the idea that the dead line would be in twenty seventeen. So from that standpoint that would have push out we'll probably fill 100 basis point but in anyone quarter it's hard to nail down exactly what the number was. I would suggest that probably in this quarter we're probably pretty close to that, maybe a little bit better than that but probably in around 100 basis points I think.","Chuck McLaughlin","I've looked at it and if we go back to maybe where before the ramp started, it's been three years and we're up about 300 basis points over that three year timeframe. As Jim said there is just some absent close in that but we think we're right on-track with that. Second half maybe puts a little pause in that and the longer timeframe -- I think -- we think it's a net positive that maybe flattens off the peak there but we think the sizing of it as we originally envisioned it well maybe a little longer timeframe is still pretty accurate.","Brian Drab","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe [ph] with Cowen & Company.","Unidentified Analyst","I'm the guy for the full year, so it seems like most of the incremental bump here is in the second half where you're expecting a bit of a deceleration on the organic options, so what specifically kind of was incremental I guess on the cost side that's driving that?","Jim Lico","Well, thanks for your question. First of all, I think that the -- it's pretty evenly split, not balanced in the second half of the year on the take up since we did beat me in Q1. It's evenly split between the tax rate coming down to 27% and also then seeing some strengthening and raising our outlooks slightly over the whole year but it's pretty balanced by quarter and I'd say it's really $0.04 for the year, $0.01 a quarter for volume and $0.01 for tax.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, fair enough. I guess I'll shift a little bit auto; I know you guys place in a very specific way with macro and stuff but I know that's an area that people are a bit more concerned about generally speaking. What are you seeing? What are your customer saying there? Are they a little bit more nervous about production rates or anything more recently than they were maybe three\/six months ago?","Jim Lico","Yes, so I think the way we think about the auto industry is mostly get Matco -- when we just think about peer vehicle, really -- obviously, Matco plays into the maintenance and dealerships and maintenance shop and really they don't really care if it's a new car or an old car, it's really about size of the fleet. So to some extent if people are holding out of their cards longer, it actually helps Matco. So I think we don't get a lot of visibility just to the new car production level, that's a $17 million U.S. car number, a $16 million number; we're sort of out of the realm of that, it doesn't really -- it really doesn't affect us that much Joe. So I think we really think about the total vehicle population and the complexity of those vehicles and the changes in those vehicles and as long as there is more complex vehicles that are harder to repair, I think those are good trends for Matco.","Unidentified Analyst","I totally appreciate that. I mean, I know that they don't really care specifically about it but just wondering if maybe you have been hearing if these guys were just kind of shop talk around where things might be going but if you're not\u2026","Jim Lico","I wish we had a real world like that but we really don't.","Unidentified Analyst","Fair enough, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers for closing remarks.","Lisa Curran","Thank you, Camille. And thank you everyone for joining us today.

We closed 2016 on a positive note delivering outperformance from both core sales and earnings growth perspectives as our outstanding team of 24,000 employees around the world, leverage the power of the Fortive Business System. 2016 was a remarkable year as we not only launched Fortive, but seamlessly serve our customers accelerating product innovation maintained or expanded leading market positions in all of our businesses and lift our values by holding over 700 Kaizens including the CEO Kaizen we highlighted last quarter.","And our first two quarters as a standalone company, Fortive delivered over 3% core revenue growth, expanded core adjusted operating margin 90 basis points and gross margin 60 basis points. Delivered free cash flow conversion of 129% and grew adjusted earnings 12% all while continuing to invest in both growth and productivity initiatives and M&A that will allow Fortive to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Living our values helping our customers accelerate progress and leveraging the power of the Fortive Business System positions us well for 2017 and beyond.","Turning to the fourth quarter of 2016 for a more detailed discussion of our results, let me first remind you that the following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the supplemental financial data posted to our website. Adjusted net earnings of $237.7 million were up 3.6% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.68. If not for the $0.04 of additional investments we guided last quarter, adjusted net earnings per share would have grown 9%. Currency was an additional $0.01 headwind to adjusted EPS. Sales grew 3.3% to $1.6 billion or a core revenue increase of 3.5% reflecting growth in five out of our six platforms.","Acquisitions contributed approximately 90 basis points of growth during the fourth quarter, which was more than offset by approximately 110 basis points of unfavorable currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Geographically for the second quarter in a row, North America and Western Europe drove low single-digit revenue growth in developed markets. High growth markets accelerated to high single-digit growth in the quarter driven primarily by China and improved results in Latin America partially offset by challenging Middle East markets. North American growth of low single-digits was driven primarily by strong performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Matco, Fluke and Kollmorgen.","Western Europe growth of high single-digits continues to reflect outperformance to the general macro environment as market share gains were realized across both professional instrumentation and industrial technology segments. As we guided last quarter, we use the outperformance in third quarter of 2016 to invest opportunistically back in our businesses in the form of both long-term growth and productivity investments. Even with those additional investments, we delivered solid margin performance in the quarter demonstrating the value of FBS and focused execution.","Gross margin was 49% reflecting 90 basis points of expansion over the prior year. Operating profit margin was 20.8% which reflects core adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 basis points. During the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $278 million of free cash flow and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 124%. For the full year, free cash flow conversion was 115%.","Turning to our segments, Professional Instrumentation posted core revenue growth of 1.2% and acceleration of almost 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2016, reflecting continued stabilization in North American industrial markets. FX was a significant headwind in the quarter of approximately 130 basis points, partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 40 basis points. Professional Instrumentation operating profit margin was 23.1% reflecting a core operating margin decline of 30 basis points driven primarily by long-term growth investments undertaken in the quarter partially offset by decreased amortization.","Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single-digits primarily led by good performance of both Fluke and Qualitrol, which comprised our field solutions platform. Field solutions core revenue was up low single-digits in the quarter with Fluke and Qualitrol posting low single-digit and high single-digit growth respectively. The growth at Fluke reflected solid demand for handheld industrial products in North America as well as Western Europe. Sell-through data continues to improve in both regions.","The integration of eMaint Enterprises continues to go well and we\u2019ve seen positive customer reaction as we launch combined offerings to provide our Fluke Condition Monitoring Solution. eMaint held a customer conference in November, where customers have the ability to preview the new integrated solutions to improve productivity of labor resources, increase equipment up time and increase asset life via shifted predictive maintenance. We were overwhelmed by the number of customers eager to be early adopters, and while it\u2019s still early days on the commercialization front, the sales funnel expanded approximately 30% in January versus December.","We\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on this important growth driver for both Fluke and Fortive. The Fluke team continues to innovate and expand the Fluke connected tool box as evidenced by the recent release of the Ti480 Infrared Camera. The Ti480 introduces 640 by 480 resolution into a ruggedized pistol grip form factor to maintenance professionals across a variety of vertical markets.","We\u2019ve seen incredible traction with this camera during it\u2019s first six weeks on the market and are excited about it\u2019s growth prospects going forward. Qualitrol\u2019s high-single digit growth marks it\u2019s eleventh consecutive quarter of positive core growth. Demand continues to be driven by utility customers in high growth markets particularly the Middle East and APAC regions where we continue to gain share with OEMs.","The Qualitrol team has made important progress executing their condition based monitoring strategy. And leveraging it\u2019s broad offering to customers clearly FBS has played a critical role in improving funnel visibility and marketing identification.","Moving to product realization the platform, core revenues were down low-single digits this quarter reflecting project timing of PacSci EMC and Invetech. For the year, these two businesses grew at low-single digit rates. Given the nature of these project based businesses it\u2019s not unexpected to see variation in growth quarter to quarter. We do have good line of sight into the backlog at PacSci EMC and Invetech and we expect continued low single digit growth trajectory forward.","Tektronix reported low-single digit core revenue growth during the quarter reflecting continued outperformance in China of high-double digits and stabilization in developed markets. China growth remains to be driven by the conductor semiconductor and communications segments where we continue to gain market share with our industry leading technology.","In North America we\u2019re seeing signs of stabilization. But no signs of recovery in the computer and semiconductor segment. The military, government and educational sectors continue to perform well here and we see tremendous traction with our 70 gigahertz real time Oscilloscope particularly within data centers.","Our Sensing Technologies platform posted high-single digit core growth in the quarter. The controls end markets continue to be challenged partially offsetting strong outperformance in our sensor businesses where we saw new key account wins globally and increased demand for our MRO products in North America.","Moving to our industrial technology segment, we realized core revenue growth of 5.6% in quarter. Acquisitions contributed approximately 130 basis points of growth relative to prior year, which was partially offset by a 100 basis points of unfavorable currency translation. Reported operating profit margin, increased to 20.7% and core operating margin was up 80 basis points for the quarter reflecting margin expansion across all platforms.","Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high-single digit growth in the quarter with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering high-single digit core revenue growth. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a headwind from the EMV related indoor point-of-sale solutions that was more than offset by an increase in outdoor EMV related demand for both dispensers and payment kits.","The November 2016 announcement regarding the outdoor liability shift in the U.S. to 2020 did not have an impact on our fourth quarter results as most customers had already ordered before year end, consistent with their capital spend budgets. Looking forward we don\u2019t expect the delay to affect the total incremental outdoor EMV opportunity that we previously outlined. And we continue to believe that this is a three to four year opportunity.","Net, net we view the 2020 timeline as a positive as it reduces our customer\u2019s near term liability and also because we expect the incremental outdoor EMV impact will be more evenly distributed over the next several years.","Telematics realized core growth of low-single digits in the quarter with most of the growth stemming from outside the U.S. Director our new SaaS platform continues to gain traction and we\u2019re encouraged by our record high installed base in the United States. We\u2019re further encouraged by the recent ELD or Electronic Logging Device decision that clears the way for ELD adoption by the transportation industry beginning in 2017.","Automation and specialty components posted mid-single digit, core revenue growth in the quarter. Automation growth was offset by core revenue decline in Jacobs Vehicle Systems which was impacted by the challenged North American heavy truck market.","Within automation Kollmorgen and Thomson both grew core revenues high-single digits. Thomson\u2019s growth was driven by distribution, medical equipment, and off-highway vertical markets. This is Kollmorgen\u2019s third consecutive quarter of growth and was reflective of outperformance in both developed and high growth markets driven primarily by targeted efforts in the medical robotics and metal-forming verticals.","Kollmorgen\u2019s use the speed design review help them execute their robotic strategy to address secular growth in collaborative robotics and they grew revenue strong double digits in China in 2016, as a result of their FBS commercial growth tools. These are just a couple of examples of how our businesses leverage FBS to drive growth and outperform their markets.","Moving to franchise distribution, which posted low-single digit growth for the quarter, I\u2019m happy to share that once again Matco grew revenue at a high-single digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same store sales and franchise apps. Matco Expo, Matco\u2019s largest franchise event of the year is in the first quarter of 2017 and we are anticipating record attendance of almost 10% over the prior year.","Matco\u2019s mid-single digit or better core revenue growth track record is now 26 out of the last 28 quarters. To wrap up, we have a strong finish in the fourth quarter contributing to a solid start for Fortive. As I had alluded to before the reinvigoration of our culture was evident as the Fortive Business System drove both core top line and earnings out performance while allowing for investment in the future.","Our excellent cash flow performance combined with our strong balance sheet leaves us well positioned for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market leading positions in 2017.","We are initiating our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes assumptions for low-single digit core revenue growth, amidst stable end markets. Combined with the benefits of our additional restructuring and growth investments this past quarter, as well as decreased amortization we anticipate core margin expansion in excess of 50 basis points with an effective tax rate of 28% for the year.","In 2017, we expect currency to be approximate headwind of 100 basis points to 200 basis points to the top line and $0.05 to EPS. As you can see from the waterfall in the slides, we expect productivity and restructuring benefits to provide a $0.04 to $0.05 tailwind and low-single digit core revenue growth at a 30% to 35% fall through to contribute $0.04 to $0.13.","Our resulting 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.60 to $2.70 implies growth of 7% at the high-end of the guidance. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.54 to $0.58, which also includes an assumption of low-single digit core revenue growth.","In closing I want to say how proud I am of our 24,000 employees for all that we\u2019ve accomplished in this milestone year. I\u2019m looking forward to Fortive\u2019s first full year as a standalone company. Fortive\u2019s culture of FBS and accountability will serve our customers and you, our shareholder as well as we live our values and work every day to deliver essential technology for the people who accelerate progress. We\u2019re committed to making 2017 another great year.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Lisa.","Lisa Curran","Thanks Jim. Before we move into questions I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to announce that Fortive will host its first Investor and Analyst Day on May 18, 2017 in New York City. Further details will be circulated soon. That concludes our formal comments.","David, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks, good afternoon everybody. I\u2019d love to \u2013 Jim, get your thoughts on the M&A pipeline actually sort of stepping back for a minute here it\u2019s obviously an important part to the overall business model. And in terms of how that\u2019s tracking the capability building up what you see and what you would like investors to have from an expectations perspective in terms of both direction and kind of how you see that maybe playing out over the next year?","Jim Lico","Thanks Steve. I think first of all, M&A continues to be our main priority so no change in that. We think today, we have about $3 billion worth of capacity over the next couple of years. And so we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunity. As we mentioned on prior calls really a number of things have been happening in relative to building our own capacity, couple deals that we\u2019ve got done in the third quarter as we mentioned on the prior call. Nothing this quarter but certainly we\u2019re very busy and I think we are very fortunate to be in a position we are at right now from a balance sheet perspective. I\u2019m highly confident we will get some things done in 2017 with a breadth of deals both from a size perspective and across the platforms.","Steven Winoker","And our bid-ask spreads in places which you think are favorable enough to getting deals done?","Jim Lico","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say pricing has been an issue at all I think at the end of the day, we\u2019ve been very much \u2013 we\u2019ve been active and I think we haven\u2019t seen much change in pricing over the last 12 months.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. And maybe just a little color \u2013 I know you had already guided to that $0.04 of additional investment last quarter and I\u2019m looking also at the core margin contraction and professional instrumentation. I think that $0.04 would probably translate to something like 120 basis points headwind overall for the whole company. But maybe just talk about where we spent, did you spend more than that is there additional restructuring how that \u2013 what was the makeup of that 30 basis point contraction that kind of thing?","Chuck McLaughlin","Hey, Steve. This is Chuck. The restructuring that we spent \u2013 we spent additional $0.02 and that was fairly evenly split between the two platforms may be a little more in terms of PI but pretty evenly split there and then I think \u2013 the other $0.02 we did an additional on growth spend.","Jim Lico","Yes, mostly I think the other $0.02 on growth was mostly in PI I think, Steve as it translated we were able to accelerate a number of things around condition monitoring, some things we want to do on the new platform to tack as well as a couple of incremental investments in other parts of the portfolio. So that just gives you a sense of both the restructuring and the growth.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. And Jim, I got you just one last thing which is what are you really sensing underlying drivers of sentiment in growth across your customer discussions particularly in light of all of the political and other changes or since November what are you hearing out there and Chuck probably should maybe comment on the tax position for the company as well?","Jim Lico","Okay, we will take that in a short answer but certainly as we talk to a number of customers we\u2019ve been out. I think there is not a real change at this point with anyone\u2019s out look at this point, lot moving around and most customers are really started waiting to really understand if there\u2019s difference from a policy perspective that are actually going to be enacted. So I would say its still very early days we note at the stabilization in the North American market from really the third to the fourth being pretty consistent so no real uptick and nor is there one plant in our guide.","Chuck McLaughlin","Steve, from the tax standpoint as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of there\u2019s so many \u2013 there\u2019s breadth of opportunities out there and changes going it\u2019s really hard for us to put a fine point on that but we would note that the corporate tax rates coming down is going to be favorable for us like it is all industrials. We\u2019re little more overweight in U.S. and we think and we know it to be a net exporter so all the scenarios I\u2019ve seen so far are going to be favorable to us but we haven\u2019t baked any of that and we are going to wait until something gets a little closer to print before we start quantifying that.","Steven Winoker","Sounds great. Thank you.","Jim Lico","Thank you, Steve.","Chuck McLaughlin","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","Jim Lico","Hey, Scott.","Chuck McLaughlin","Hey, Scott. I\u2019m trying to get a sense \u2013 I mean just a couple of things and one just nitpicky but is this \u2013 is 6.1% kind of the level of R&D that you expect to kind of stay at longer term and same kind of my question SG&A added, maybe you addressed why that went up year-over-year but is that function of some of the new acquisitions are came in or is that a \u2013 kind of a new level now that you\u2019ve had a chance to hire people that you needed to hire and build-out the corporate structure that you\u2019ve needed?","Jim Lico","The R&D, the 6.1 we\u2019ve been right around there, up or down 10 basis points and now you expect this to be there, when you click down by opco there\u2019s going to be some changes this projects ebb and flow but no real changes to our R&D from \u2013 we want to change the investment level. So its just the normal place. The big thing that\u2019s going on in terms of SG&A is the growth investments we put in, in the second half of the year as we saw the top line strengthening we kicked off a little bit more investment and we really called out some of that in the third quarter when we overachieved in the third quarter so we\u2019re going to even put a little bit more to try and accelerate and help us out next year.","Scott Davis","Fair enough. And then just a follow-up I\u2019m guessing you guys would be pretty disappointed if you just did 3% to 7% EPS growth your first full year out of the gate. Is this \u2013 would you characterize this is a fairly conservative forecast that you would certainly hope to be able to beat or don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth but we can address that a bit, how you think about that?","Jim Lico","Scott, we think of it in a couple of ways first the guide doesn\u2019t assume any M&A. And so whether you are getting into high single-digits without the benefit of deploying using our balance sheet is what we\u2019ve been really consistently saying and we feel pretty good about that. Having said that, as Jim said we expect to deploy some M&A and that\u2019s the thing I think is going to take our \u2013 that I expect to take our earnings growth up over the next year or two.","Scott Davis","Okay. Best of luck, guys. Thank you.","Jim Lico","Thanks Scott. Have a good day.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, evening guys. Just want to \u2013 can you hear me?","Jim Lico","Yes, we can. Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yes. Hi, Jim. So can you just maybe talk about the low single-digits growth for next year, and how that\u2019s \u2013 how you\u2019ve seen that shaken out by segment and maybe by SPU? And maybe just as a follow on to that, if you just look at some of your canary in a coal mine businesses such as automation, up high single-digits. It feels like there\u2019s a bit more of a powerful recovery maybe warm in here. You obviously not ready to make that call, but maybe just dress up on that as well.","Chuck McLaughlin","So, Nigel, the thing is on the core growth it has low single-digits that\u2019s we posted a couple of low single-digits in the second half of 2016. Our markets remain stable. We\u2019re not seeing a big change in them going forward and that\u2019s really about what we\u2019re seeing in the way with what\u2019s the guide is going forward. Certainly there are some things that are going up and down by regions and by product lines, but net-net we haven\u2019t seen any big recovery.","Jim Lico","Nigel, maybe just a little bit of color, I think as we said in the prepared remarks, regionally we expect sort of the U.S. and kind of the developed markets to be \u2013 what I would say relatively stable in that kind of low single-digit range, will probably get a little bit uptick in the high growth markets above that, maybe mid single-digits and the high growth markets for the year. So that\u2019s kind of our thought here.","We don\u2019t anticipate any big shift in any of the markets. Relative to operating company, certainly we\u2019re seeing a little bit better growth in places like Fluke that we expect, in automation, Kollmorgen\u2019s three quarters in a row, track record is pretty good \u2013 is obviously very good, we\u2019re very pleased with that. And then some of the perennial folks like Matco and Gilbarco will continue to do well.","But I think it\u2019s a very balanced approach to growth I think as we think about it, both regionally as well as within \u2013 as Chuck mentioned in the segments and certainly as you drill down in the operating companies, pretty balanced as well. Still a little noisy at Tektronix, particularly in the developed markets, they\u2019re doing an outstanding job in their high growth markets, particularly in China as we noted on the prepared remarks, but we still think Tek is going to be a little noisy in the first half.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that\u2019s great. It\u2019s great color. Just as a quick follow-on, the bridge looks very reasonable in totality. You\u2019ve had a little bit of a couple questions on the incremental margins for next year, 30% \u2013 35%. I think a lot of folks see you as a 35% or maybe better flow through. Anything \u2013 just thinking about it now, is it going to be conservative, anything in terms of growth investment, restructuring that you think into next year?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well, Nigel, two things one is if you\u2019re looking at on the bridge there, we do call it 30% \u2013 35%. But we also call out a couple bars back where there\u2019s productivity that probably take that number to be a little bit higher and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been seeing this year being a little bit better on that flow through getting to the OMX of around 50 basis points.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Jim Lico","Thanks Nigel.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good afternoon.","Jim Lico","Good afternoon.","Chuck McLaughlin","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. My first question was really just be on the industrial tech piece and GVR specifically. You\u2019d mentioned some sort of headwinds around the indoor rollouts in Q4. So I just wondered how you see that playing out over the next kind of 12 months in terms of the U.S. indoor versus outdoor growth rates.","Chuck McLaughlin","So we would expect the indoor to be a headwind now for the next four quarters or so, Julian. It\u2019s really \u2013 we\u2019re at about what we would say is kind of a run \u2013 a typical run rate, almost a replacement rate at this point. So it will be a headwind the rest of the year.","We noted that for Fortive the EMV outdoor would be around 100 basis points of health. We probably now think that\u2019s going to be a little bit under given the announcement to 2020. We still have a firm belief in the strength of the opportunity over the next three or four years through 2020, but maybe an air pocket or two this year as some of our customers may be delayed things a quarter or two.","I think very consistently with what we talked about because we\u2019ve been talking about EMV over 12 months, haven\u2019t been in the industry for a long time. We really don\u2019t think it will be the summertime before really have a good sense of how this is going to roll out over the next couple of years.","Julian Mitchell","Understood, thanks. And then my follow-up would just be around the sensing business. That have had a very tough couple of years I think maybe some share loss in their, seem to come back in the fourth quarter. Maybe give a little bit of detail on what drove the sensing recovery and what sort of growth rates you should expect that piece to have over the next sort of 12 months?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well, I think first we were pleased in the fourth quarter with the performance. We think about the sensing platform as two pieces, the control aspect which is things like temperature controllers and then peer sensing particularly our sensing businesses Gems and Anderson-Negele. The sensing businesses are going to certainly grow in the mid single-digit range, they\u2019re really \u2013 they had a little bit easier comp in the fourth quarter, but they\u2019ll post that some of those comps through the year and I think we have good growth this year. That\u2019s on the backs of some new OEM wins as well as just broader MRO performance.","So what we think \u2013 I think we\u2019re probably in that low to mid single-digit growth for them for the platform for the rest of the year, little bit depended on how the control site does, but we\u2019re very bullish on the sensor side of that and we think they will have a good year in 2017.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Chuck McLaughlin","Thank you.","Jim Lico","Thanks Julian.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good day everyone.","Jim Lico","Hi, Jeff.","Chuck McLaughlin","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Hi. Jim, could you touch a little bit more on really Tek and how you see it plane for the year? I think through the back half of 2016 you\u2019re kind of gearing up for some new product launches, just kind of a refresh going on. Is there any particular timeline to think about in terms of meaningful things hitting the market or do they expect some kind of more gradual progression there?","Jim Lico","Yes. So the fourth quarter performance was really more of a story of just them blocking and tackling well. The high-growth market is doing very well. China, India, number of those markets doing well. So there really was not as much an innovation story, that\u2019s really to come.","I think we highlighted that they have a new platform coming out in the second half of the year, which we\u2019re really excited about. We think it will deliver some increased revenue for sure. And we just passed a major milestone on that platform here a couple of weeks ago, so it gives us even more confidence that launch is going to be on time in the second half and that will start a series of new products over the next several years. So it\u2019s not just sort of one big launch in the second half, but really office platform that will keep a level of innovation in the marketplace that we\u2019re excited about. So the tech team is doing \u2013 I think we\u2019ll see a little bit choppy first half. I think they will probably be okay in the first quarter because they\u2019re little bit easier comp in the first quarter as well. But I think as we get to the second half we\u2019ll see improved performance.","Unidentified Analyst","In a similar vein in terms of kind of growth initiatives maybe update us a little bit on the Fluke Connect. You mentioned it in your opening script, but how that is progressing maybe the size of the business at this point if you would like to share with any other color around that.","Jim Lico","Yes. When we launched the condition \u2013 we have the Fluke Connect tools out for a few years and then just as we mentioned on the new infrared camera, this is the launch of another connected tool which is great. So that level of innovation we\u2019ve continued into the marketplace. The condition monitoring solution that will certainly highlight at the Investor Conference as well. We\u2019ll give you a sense of that, but that really got launched in the fourth quarter. Early days as I mentioned that combined with the eMate suite, software suite that will be an integrated solution here shortly. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of dual selling that\u2019s able to happen with the team relative to the getting sales leads and building funnel.","But it\u2019s still fairly early days, not a lot of revenue yet. I think one thing the sales cycles a little bit longer. This is a SaaS-based solution. So it takes a little bit longer to get the customer to think through that. So I think we\u2019re probably not going to see meaningful revenue to the second half, as we work through the lead gen, work through the funnel and then obviously you need to build momentum with SaaS-based business before it starts to bring the cash register.","So we \u2013 it\u2019s really probably a second half even in the 2018 kind of story, but we\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019re very \u2013it\u2019s still early days I said in the prepared remarks, but I think we\u2019re in a very good place relative to the solution and the way customers are really understanding and getting to understand the solutions.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Jim Lico","Maybe just a final note on that \u2013 we\u2019ve got about that the target market on that is about 600,000 manufacturing sites around the world where they really, really don\u2019t have a solution today and can really easily install the solution for a low, with a very low interest costs and ability to upsell them with new features over time. So it takes a little while to get out of those places and get the lead generation engine going, but we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve started and I\u2019m very \u2013 I\u2019ve got great optimism here.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Jim Lico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Good afternoon.","Jim Lico","Hi, Rick.","Richard Eastman","Jim, Chuck, maybe one of you could just address pricing and how much price we\u2019re able to capture in 2016 and maybe what the outlook is for 2017. And just kind of flow that into the gross margin discussion, I\u2019m curious with gross margin of 90 basis points year-over-year. What\u2019s the realistic pacing of improvement? We gross margin year-over-year that we should look forward kind of help you pay for the other investments.","Chuck McLaughlin","So Rick, it\u2019s Chuck. Couple of things for the year, I think we were up 40 basis points in pricing and our gross margins \u2013 the easy one going for 50 basis points is a good thing to plug in looking forward deploying FBS from all the levers that we have that it sometimes it can be a little higher, sometimes going to be a little lower. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 those are the quick answers. One thing I feel like a probably get your next question is Q4 was actually down in pricing and it was down 20 basis points largely due to the some big deals around EMV. If we call that out, we would\u2019ve been up 10 points to 20 points and special instrumentation and industrial technologies, but because of that EMV some of the big deals, some of the big guys that did post negative in Q4, but still 40 basis points for the year.","Jim Lico","And maybe this is a final point, even though we did have a little bit more price at Gilbarco on the quarter, we had excellent gross margin in performance in the quarter. So one of the things we look at the combination of pricing gross margin is probably part of your question Rick, is to make sure that even if we\u2019re giving up a little price, sometimes we\u2019re giving price on maybe higher software or something that inevitably brings higher gross margins in the portfolio anyway. And in this case even with that price, we are able to as you pointed out to deliver excellent gross margins.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Is it noticeable, the mix of business shifting again towards description toward SaaS. Is that noticeable or is just really about price and about and FBS at this point.","Jim Lico","I think at this point it still price in FBS. I mean that we really do as you know, we drive businesses really hard on a regular basis around continuous improvement on gross margins. Price is an FBS tool and we utilize it in every business every year. So those are just kind of standard work in our businesses. If our SaaS and software today its 4%. Those businesses were up about \u2013up double digit. I think if we look at all those collective offerings in the quarter, but it\u2019s still a small part of the business. It\u2019s really going to take a little while for that, that to really be a meaningful impact.","And that part of our confidence whenever we get the question about our ability to drive gross margins over time, it\u2019s not only the power of FBS, but it\u2019s also the business mix that we can see over the next four or five years that coming at us.","Richard Eastman","Yes. And then just last question on the telematics business, the shift has been going on, I\u2019m going to say industry wide, but certainly at Fortive towards more of a SaaS-based model for subscription on within the telematics business. Is that going to continue and will it keep the growth rate within the telematics business kind of in this low-single digit range here for another 12 months or could that accelerate.","Jim Lico","Yes. It should accelerate. I think the market\u2019s growing. I think as we pointed out last couple of quarters that our non-U.S. business has been exceptionally good. We added in the fourth quarter double-digit units into the portfolio, but because of a variety of different things that we needed to do relative to some customers they didn\u2019t necessarily, it doesn\u2019t necessarily transition in the quarter right, because it SaaS takes a number of quarters to play out. So we think that this certainly can be the markets growing in the U.S. mid to high-single digits and in some segments even higher than that.","So we really believe. We\u2019ve launched this new director platform as we mentioned in the prepared remarks and we\u2019re excited about it. We need to get it more pervasively through our installed base. And we think once that\u2019s more in with more customers are opportunity to change the trajectory that growth rate is pretty good as we move throughout 2017.","Richard Eastman","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Jim Lico","Thanks. Have a great night.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Good evening everyone.","Jim Lico","Hi Shannon.","Chuck McLaughlin","Hi Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Hey Jim maybe just follow-up on the EMV, the idea of maybe people pushing things out a little bit, post the deadline. I mean have you heard that so far and also what\u2019s your view on how the mix of kits versus the dispensers might shift versus now that there\u2019s a longer timeframe do you think people might get the kit and wait for a full dispenser upgrade. Maybe just some thoughts on how the push out might affect some of the dynamics even if the overall opportunities. Thanks.","Jim Lico","Yes, I think our instincts, right, as we said we really wouldn\u2019t know what the rollout would be. I think our instincts would tell us right now. I know it\u2019s not as much customer conversations as it is instinct haven\u2019t been in the industry for 20 years. Our instincts tell us will be a little bit of a pause here for customers as they think about the rollout strategy. That will be months and quarters not years. So but \u2013 and that\u2019s why we think we come off a little bit of that 100 basis points maybe a little bit less than 100 basis points.","But those are the upside of that is \u2013 as they probably a better curve in terms of rollout, and as you mentioned we think probably less kits and more dispensers. So probably, as we get to mid-year, we\u2019ll have a better sense of that, where we remodel it every month, but I think our model will be more accurate. And at that point, we\u2019ll have a better sense for the market opportunity. But I think we always knew that there was probably going to be some level of push out and this really is probably mostly good news for us relative to how the next several years are look.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay, thanks. And then as you think about the payoff from some of these growth investments, I just \u2013 you look at a business like Qualitrol that\u2019s grown for 11 straight quarters. It seems like every once in a while, you guys have a business like that goes on one of these run. Was that the result of some growth investment prior year, you saw particular market opportunity and if the current spending, do you see that kind of opportunity in other business and then you\u2019re spending money on now.","Jim Lico","Yes, it\u2019s a couple things. One is that some expansion in resources around sales force around the world. The business just is doing great globally. That\u2019s number one. And in a couple of acquisitions, we did several years ago that gave us that can some of the products from a condition monitoring perspective that are driving some growth as well. So there \u2013 the team is done and that\u2019s the growth flywheel that we talk about metaphorically, so often about how acquisitions even small ones could accelerate growth in mid-size businesses and we think that that opportunity exists in a number of places in the portfolio.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Great, thanks.","Jim Lico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys, good evening.","Jim Lico","Hi, Steve.","Chuck McLaughlin","Hi, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you just touch on organic growth for the \u2013 have you\u2019re going to start here for the first quarter just generally and then anything seasonally to think about on the EPS split, as it work for the year from a quarterly perspective.","Jim Lico","Yes, I think the core growth as we\u2019re talking about a slow single digit, but we do have an easier compare in Q1. So it\u2019s probably going to the higher end of that range in Q1. And then I think that the EPS split as it goes through the year, we\u2019re still learning as we go here, but it\u2019s going to be something like 22, 26 \u2013 26, 28 if I get the numbers. That probably didn\u2019t adequately. But it\u2019s in those range\u2026","Steve Tusa","Okay, perfect. And I know I snap on it talked about some weakness in their business, maybe just from a macro perspective anything to talk about their growth rates \u2013 growth rate wise, it\u2019s been pretty strong in the last couple years, just curious if there\u2019s anything that changes here in the intermediate term.","Jim Lico","Yes, they had a strong quarter, again the team is really executing well. They\u2019re continuing expand franchises, which really drives growth. We really kind of make sure that same-store sales are good. I suspect there was a little bit annoyed and if we went month to month, but as we really roll up the quarter, it was still very good. So I think at this point, what we\u2019re seeing right now with a combination of just wonderful attendance rate at our expo here in a couple of weeks as well as a good start. I think we\u2019re still going to be in that mid to high single-digit range for a while now. They\u2019re doing a great job. As we\u2019ve said and I know this is, FBS is really just one of our \u2013 from a growth perspective, is one of our best businesses for deploying FBS and our \u2013 in from a growth perspective. So they\u2019ll continue to do that. And I think will continue to perform well.","Steve Tusa","And then one last one, you may have discussed if I may have missed it, sorry, if that happened but any \u2013 on the acquisition front, any commentary on whether it\u2019s kind of tougher to get things to the finish line with all the uncertainty out there out of Washington. And any color around, the phase of discussions between the buyers and sellers or even just being able to see the deal given the uncertainty around tax rates et cetera.","Jim Lico","Nothing yet, I think we\u2019ve been number of things that we\u2019re doing actively have been going on for a little while. I don\u2019t necessarily get a sense that anyone\u2019s holding up for doing anything, because of waiting for Washington to do anything. And obviously, our discussions are global as well. So between the various things that go on both from a macroeconomic perspective in a geopolitical situation, you\u2019ve got a number of elections in Europe as well, which provide some uncertainty and usually uncertainty is a good thing, so for M&A. So I think all those things roll up to I think a pretty good environment right now. And as I mentioned before the bit out they haven\u2019t changed radically. So I \u2013 that\u2019s what gives me confidence say I know we\u2019ll do some deals here in 2017.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Jim Lico","Thanks, have a great evening.","Chuck McLaughlin","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Hi, guys. Good evening.","Jim Lico","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on China. Can you just talk about Chinese trend and we\u2019ve been hearing that there are some messages in China about delays in capital spending in the first quarter yet. All the numbers that have been reported by corporate so far very good, and everybody believes that things continue to accelerate. Can you just give a more detail lead as to what you\u2019re seeing in China?","Jim Lico","Yes, sure. I think, one we don\u2019t have a lot of CapEx businesses in China. So we\u2019re really fortunate to have things that are more related operating expense kinds of things. We\u2019re certainly getting the benefit of the secular trend in Tektronix, where they really well positioned themselves over the years to take advantage of a lot of the semiconductor and communication expansion that\u2019s going there and they\u2019re doing exceptionally well.","So that\u2019s in our \u2013 certainly in our number and really have to do with \u2013 it really isn\u2019t a macro point. I think we go around the rest of the portfolio though we\u2019re continuing to see strength with a number of our OEMs that our automation team has partnerships with in our cultural business has and our food business is done pretty well as well. So we had \u2013 we just had an exceptional fourth quarter. I don\u2019t necessarily think that the strength that we\u2019ve seen is necessarily what happened all of 2017. But we still feel very bullish on what China look like next year and think it\u2019ll outpace our overall growth rate next year.","Andrew Obin","You\u2019re not seeing a slowdown in China so far.","Jim Lico","Not really, not really \u2013 it\u2019s still early right, you could never call China until about March, because of the new year in particularly the way the new year was position this year. So it is the \u2013 having run China for a long time. I generally try not to make any predictions and so well into March.","Andrew Obin","That makes sense. And just one question, you sort of highlighted highway Thomson being very strong. Could you just comment what region or end market that refers to?","Jim Lico","That\u2019s mostly a North America and a little bit of China comment. Their positions are pretty niche. So it really is market share gains for them and business with that size a few big market share wins really makes a big difference.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. Thank you.","Jim Lico","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good afternoon, guys.","Jim Lico","Hey, Andy.","Chuck McLaughlin","Andy, how are you doing?","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good, how are you? So Western Europe grew high single digits in the quarter and last quarter I think you said it was going to moderate, it doesn\u2019t seem like it did sell. So maybe you could talk about that. And then how concerned are you that geopolitical risk over there could moderate the growth as you go into 2017 because it does look like it\u2019s performing pretty well for you right now.","Jim Lico","Yes. You\u2019re exactly right. Thanks for calling out my inability to forecast the geography. But clearly I think what we saw, some really good performance with some work that we\u2019ve been doing like at Kollmorgen on collaborative robots where they have a number of strong customers in Europe. And the number of businesses as well that are really more secular driven than any macro. And that continued in the quarter, but we don\u2019t think that that will continue. You mentioned some of the geopolitical risk I think we \u2013 Chuck and I would say that that does exist. We\u2019re monitoring it to understand it and we do think that Western Europe will moderate through the balance \u2013 through 2017.","But we still think it will grow, we still think its probably at least a low single digit grower right now and it might be a little bit more noisy month to month and maybe even quarter to quarter because of what we just described on the election cycle. But I still think given our positions and what we\u2019ve been doing from an execution perspective, we feel good that we can get growth out of Europe this year.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Chuck maybe you can talk about free cash flow conversion that you mentioned at end of the year that 115%, I know you guided its greater than 100% for the year. But can you talk about if there\u2019s any reason why free cash flow conversion would materially change in 2017. The business does ramp up a bit more, do you need more working capital to fund the business any sort of puts and takes that we should think about as we go into 2017 here?","Chuck McLaughlin","Yes, I think you got pretty well nailed. 115% for the year I think that\u2019s a strong number for us. There\u2019s a couple of things that give us a little downward pressure we have a little bit of amortization rolling off in the year into 2017. We also finish really strong in our collections and that has a little bit of artifact to the days and how they fell out and probably be wise for us to count on that. So we think definitely over 100% and I think that\u2019s a good number for us.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. And just real quick follow up. The weakness that you said at GBS we start to see orders pickup in the U.S. heavy truck market have you seen any impact on the business yet or is it too early for that.","Jim Lico","I think its certainly still early, their story for performances they have done a great job of mitigating much of the North American challenge \u2013 with a great challenge with a great business in China. But we\u2019re \u2013 its still a little early days on North America and if that\u2019s going to tick up or not.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks guys.","Jim Lico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton","Yes, good afternoon, Jim and Chuck. I guess my first question is on EMV I think in the past one of the key competitive advantages that was highlighted was first market with qualified products. I\u2019m just curious if the delayed enforcement opens the window for increased competition or is that more of an indoor phenomena.","Jim Lico","Well, certainly the certifications and those kinds of things are certainly something that was from an early perspective is really one of the reasons why we have such great growth last couple of years in North America. At the end of the day there\u2019s really it\u2019s sort of mostly a two horse race here and with good competitor there in Wayne. So I think at the end of the day how that will play out over the next several years is how we predicted. So we were never counting on that certifications being our competitive advantage. Our real competitive advantage is being number one, and dispensers being number one in payments and having the largest retail POS system for retail petroleum in the industry. So you combine that with our lead detection capability at Veeder-Root that ultimately is our completive weapon it\u2019s the technology we have at the site that we think is how we compete in. It\u2019s a logical competition amongst smart minded players if you will. So we \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reason why we like the market so much.","Patrick Newton","Great. Thank you for the detailed answer. And I guess shifting to M&A focusing on a transaction that occurred in the test measurement industry rather large take out to whatever extent you can comment. Did you look at the asset and if so any discussion you can provide there and if not why not. And then just given that we\u2019re seeing that test measurement industry kind of heat up given multiple companies are looking to roll up the industry can you help us compare how this fits into your ranks as an M&A opportunity relative to your other platforms.","Jim Lico","Well as we think about M&A relative to both field solutions and product realization or where Fluke and tech are. We certainly feel very strongly that additions to the set of solutions that we want to add at Fluke in manufacturing, in facilities where we take advantage of our huge installed base as Fluke are going to really like eMaint like we did last quarter are going to be the transactions or something bigger that would give us the ability to leverage our position around the world. Those are great deals and I think we\u2019ve said over time that our funnel for field solutions is been good for a while.","Relative to tech and product realization, there was certainly a large transaction \u2013 we know the company well, we used to be in that industry but we got out of it. So we really were interested in it, we felt strongly that that exposure to the telecommunications players and things like that over time was probably less where we were going. So I think from that perspective it\u2019s probably safe to say that while we were in that business a number of years ago and so we know a number of the players in the industry, its where we\u2019re going with Tektronix is really around service and adding capabilities there to reduce volatility, to improve the margin structure, built on the great brand that we have attacked. Those are going to be the kind of deals that we would typically play that would be in our suite spot. But nothing in industries where we\u2019d likely see more volatility and where we\u2019d see consolidation amongst customers.","Patrick Newton","Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","Jim Lico","All right. Thanks, Patrick. Have a great night.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, good evening guys.","Jim Lico","Hey, Joe.","Chuck McLaughlin","Good evening.","Joe Ritchie","So following up on that price cost question from earlier, I guess what your expectation in for 2017. Are you baking in much material or labor inflation and your ability to use price to offset any of that.","Jim Lico","So Joe, what we\u2019ve got begin is \u2013 what we normally have been looking for we think we have opportunities for 30 to 50 basis points of price. I think your question, on the cost side about what we expect from commodities and inflation and we\u2019re not really seeing a lot of inflation and if this plan. So when we see it will react to it. And we also have one of the great things about our portfolio\u2019s we\u2019re not exposed to a lot of commodities. So as this mean we\u2019re perhaps zero, but fairly little. So we haven\u2019t seen much of that upward pressure but even when there is we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a big driver that we won\u2019t be able to offset.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I guess maybe thinking on the margin point for a second. I saw that in your 2017 earnings bridge. You did get caught about $0.04 or $0.05 productivity and restructuring benefits. How much flexibility do you guys have to potentially collect this number higher and in this net of the growth investments that you\u2019re making in 2017 as well?","Chuck McLaughlin","So what we haven\u2019t here is \u2013 in on that line is the investments that we made in prior years in 2016. How much we think that\u2019s going to improve our earnings because we invested in the business in the year before. So that\u2019s what that is the whole guide does include we expect to be doing restructuring in these businesses at all times. So in any point in time there\u2019s with the number of businesses we have and things going on there\u2019s always some level of this restructuring.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Got it.","Jim Lico","Joe, I just wanted to add to that. That includes growth to \u2013 so when we think about it what Chuck and I view on our quarterly basis as we mean with every month we meet with our operating leaders to go through the financial. And if we think we have opportunity both either on the cost side or on the growth side will typically make decisions for incremental investments as we see the quarter play out.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That makes sense. Thank you, guys.","Jim Lico","All right, thanks, Joe.","Operator","We will take our next question from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian Drab","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just have two quick follow ups to earlier questions. On the free cash flow for the year, do we need to see a pickup in M&A activity for you to get to that 100% and above to get to that threshold \u2013 given you \u2013 if without that you won\u2019t have some of the low hanging fruit in terms of working capital generation.","Jim Lico","No, good question, but no, no our guide have been 100% or 105% free cash flow to net income does not assume any significant change in that. Going forward over time I can see that percentage working up with when we \u2013 as we do more M&A and get that benefit amortization you\u2019ll see it come off of 100% to 105% to something higher. But that is not in there now.","Brian Drab","Okay, thanks. And then I may have missed this. But when you\u2019re talking about the impact of price, I heard you talk about 2016 in the fourth quarter but what is baked into the 2017 forecast in terms of price.","Chuck McLaughlin","So we have but baked into next year 50 basis points of operating margin \u2013 gross margin expansion. Price is a piece of that and we would expect through the cycles to get 30 to 50 basis points there. Not every quarter but when you take a look at three or four quarters that\u2019s what we typically average.","Brian Drab","Okay, thanks very much.","Jim Lico","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","Charley Brady","Hey, thanks guys. Just a couple of quick one\u2019s here. Can you give me a little granularity on a lot of talk around border tariffs and kind of make a sense of any meaningful amount of COGS that you\u2019re getting from outside that goes into the U.S. manufacturing operations? And if there were something meaningful that we hit that line in your cost of goods sold line. And then on the other side of that kind of what you\u2019re manufacturing maybe outside the U.S. you\u2019re bringing back and get sold in here that could be affected by any kind of border tariff or tax?","Jim Lico","Well, there\u2019s a lot of scenarios out there and we\u2019re watching them all. But net, net from the best way, the way we\u2019re working on it that we were a net exporter here. And so every scenario that I have seen this is going to be favorable to us. We do have things that we import externally but we export more. So every \u2013 so far in every scenario that I think we\u2019re going to turn out to have a lower tax rates as if and when they pass the law and in act.","Charley Brady","Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s all I have.","Jim Lico","All right, thanks, Charley.","Lisa Curran","All right. We thanks for joining us today. Remember we announced our Investor Day will be May 18 and Josh and I are around this evening if you have any follow up questions.

","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James Lico","Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.87 for the third quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 18% year-over-year despite short-cycle slowing that intensified over the course of the quarter. While these challenges impacted growth in certain parts of our Professional Instrumentation segment, a double-digit increase in earnings and strong cash flow performance demonstrated both the contribution from our recent acquisitions and the strength of the Fortive Business System to provide resilience to our portfolio. ","As we navigate the slowing in the short term, we continue to invest in our businesses to drive organic innovation, fuel further compounding and execute our capital allocation strategy to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage across the portfolio. ","We have completed a significant amount of deal activity over the past 3 years, and the execution of our capital allocation strategy continues. We have owned Advanced Sterilization Products for a little more than 2 quarters, and we're pleased with its performance thus far and continue to make substantial progress with its integration. In the coming weeks, we will close on China, representing a significant step forward as we bring the remainder of ASP's geographies under our direct control. ","As we roll off the transition service agreements and install key elements of the Fortive Business System in the coming quarters, we will lay the groundwork for accelerating innovation and growth in the years ahead. We also continue to make progress with respect to the intended separation of NewCo, which we announced on September 4. Utilizing FBS, we have taken substantial steps forward with respect to our preparations, and we remain on track toward completing the transaction in the second half of 2020. We look forward to providing additional details on the transaction and updates on further milestones for NewCo in the coming weeks and months. ","With that, I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $311 million, up 13% over the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.87. Sales grew 16.2% to $1.9 billion, reflecting a core revenue increase of 2.1% and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Core revenue growth was highlighted by strong performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root and PacSci EMC, which was partially offset by declines in the short-cycle businesses within Professional Instrumentation, including Fluke, Tektronix and some parts of Sensing Technologies. ","Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 120 basis points. Geographically, developed markets core revenue grew low single digits, reflecting the slowing macro conditions across both North America and Western Europe. Core revenue growth in North America was low single digits, led by GVR, EMC and Industrial Scientific, while Western Europe grew slightly. High-growth markets core revenue decreased low single digits due to the loss of Huawei-related revenue at Tektronix and weaker market conditions in the Middle East. China posted slightly positive growth as strong performance at Fluke and Qualitrol was largely offset by a decline in Tektronix due to the Huawei impact and flat performance at GVR. India was flat as growth at Fluke and Qualitrol was offset by timing delays for certain large project rollouts at GVR, which are now expected to start in the fourth quarter. ","Adjusted operating profit margin was 21.3%, representing a year-over-year decrease of 80 basis points, including 55 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Core operating margins decreased 25 basis points as the continued slowing within Professional Instrumentation more than offset strength at GVR and another solid quarter of operating margin expansion in Matco. ","During the third quarter, we generated $348 million of free cash flow for a sequential increase of $111 million from the second quarter. This free cash flow performance represented a conversion ratio of 168%. ","Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 24.8% despite a low single-digit decrease in core revenue. The significant contribution of recent acquisitions, most notably ASP, continued to drive overall growth within Professional Instrumentation. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 110 basis points. Segment-level adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, representing a year-over-year decrease of 300 basis points, including 120 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Core operating margins decreased 180 basis points, reflecting a combination of slower revenue performance, the impact of tariffs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. ","Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue decreased low single digits as strong performance at EMC was more than offset by continued slowing across Fluke and Tektronix. Field solutions core revenue decreased low single digits, including a low single-digit decline in developed markets driven primarily by slowing at Fluke in North America. High-growth markets increased low single digits driven by growth at Fluke and strong performance from Qualitrol in China. Fluke's core revenue declined mid-single digits due to a high single-digit decrease at Fluke Industrial. Fluke Digital Systems grew greater than 20%, led by strong growth at eMaint, which generated a 10% increase in net new customers and a greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue. From a geographic perspective, the slowing that emerged at the end of the second quarter became more pronounced in the third quarter, particularly in North America, which saw a high single-digit decrease in revenue with slowing point-of-sale trends. ","Fluke generated mid-single-digit growth in China driven by strong performance across Fluke Industrial, process instruments and food networks. Fluke Health won a multimillion-dollar order for RadWatch, a product developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army to monitor and measure radiation dosage. The acquisition of PR\u00dcFTECHNIK closed at the beginning of the quarter and has gotten off to a solid start. We are excited about the integration of PR\u00dcFTECHNIK -- how the integration of PR\u00dcFTECHNIK enhances Fluke's offering and capabilities with respect to asset reliability and condition monitoring. ","ISC delivered low single-digit core growth as decreases in Western Europe and China partially offset stronger performance in North America. ISC's lower core growth in the quarter reflected a decline in instrument sales, which tend to be more sensitive to broader macro slowing. ISC's iNET offering had another strong quarter, generating mid-teens growth as ISC continues to increase its share of subscription-based recurring revenue. ISC also recently launched the WiFi-enabled Ventis Pro5 Multi-Gas Monitor, ISC's first direct-to-cloud product and a key step forward for ISC's emerging connected worker safety initiative. The integrations of both Intelex and SAFER Systems are progressing well, positioning ISC to significantly advance its safety-as-a-service strategy aimed at providing real-time solutions for its customers' environmental, health and safety-related workflows. ","Qualitrol's core revenue declined low single digits as the continued challenges in North America, Western Europe and the Middle East were partially offset by greater than 20% growth in China and greater than 30% growth in Latin America. Qualitrol saw mid-teens growth in their basic sensors product line driven by share gains and have started to see early signs of more positive bookings momentum heading into the fourth quarter. ","Our facilities and asset management businesses, Gordian and Accruent, both rolled core during the third quarter but had a relatively small effect on the core performance of Professional Instrumentation given the partial period. These businesses continued to perform well, generating high single-digit core growth. Gordian's procurement platform, in particular, continues to drive strong growth, paced by increased construction volume with large enterprise customers, including the New York City Department of Education. Gordian also recently closed its largest facility planning deal to date with CommonSpirit Health systems to complete a facility condition assessment across its entire network. Accruent saw slower growth in the quarter due to softer licensing revenue as it transitions customers away from certain legacy products toward its higher-growth SaaS offerings. The company continues to generate strong SaaS bookings with its sales team increasingly driving enterprise customers towards longer-term subscription-based contracts with higher total contract value. Accruent added more than 70 customers in the third quarter while significantly expanding its existing contract with Cushman & Wakefield to cover a broader range of offerings across Accruent's software platform. ","Product realization core revenue decreased slightly as strong growth at both EMC and Invetech was offset by continued weakness at Tektronix. EMC generated another quarter of broad-based double-digit sales growth across both its core defense product lines and its commercial satellite offering. EMC continues to maintain a very strong backlog with large recent customer wins and increasing momentum among commercial satellite operators, providing the company with excellent revenue visibility into next year. ","Tektronix registered high single-digit decrease in core revenue. Tektronix continue to be negatively impacted by slowing at Keithley, broad-based weakness in Western Europe and the loss of its Huawei business due to U.S. government-imposed trade restrictions earlier this year. While Tektronix registered strong growth from its high-performance oscilloscopes driven by the 5G buildout in China, it also saw further slowing in North America, including a low double-digit decline for its core mid-range scopes. Negative point-of-sale trends present an ongoing challenge heading into the fourth quarter. Despite the macro challenges, which we expect to persist into next year, Tektronix continues to focus on business execution, driving gains in its strategic growth segments, including key data center and automotive wins during the quarter. ","Core revenue for Sensing Technologies decreased low single digits as growth in North America and China was more than offset by weakness in Western Europe. Anderson-Negele had a strong quarter using FBS commercial tools to drive continued share gains in adjacent segments of the food and beverage end market. Building on the momentum in its environmental monitoring offering, Setra recently launched its Setra Lite product line, providing a simple, cost-effective and highly visible solution to address pressure monitoring requirements in hospital rooms, which has been very well-received by the market. ","Turning to Advanced Sterilization Products, the company grew low single digits, in line with our expectations, as we continue to work our way through the completion of the transition service agreements. ASP's growth was led by strong performance in China and Japan, which saw continued momentum in terminal sterilization as well as strong growth in high-level disinfection tied to the recent launch of its new automatic endoscope reprocessor product line for the Japanese market. ","ASP also landed some key wins in North America, expanding its footprint and overall portfolio in strategic integrated delivery networks in both Texas and Illinois. The ASP team has begun to apply the Fortive Business System to streamline its innovation efforts and accelerate the introduction of a series of new products targeted for launch in 2020. Consistent with our strategy to build strong positions in connected workflows, we recently signed an agreement to acquire Sensus, a leading provider of instrument tracking software as a key addition to our sterilization offering. Sensus provides central sterilization departments with frontline error prevention tools and analytics which help improve efficiency and productivity in sterilization workflows, optimize compliance reporting and reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infections. We expect the acquisition to close before the end of the year. ","Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenue grew 5.2%, including core revenue growth of 6.5%. Acquisitions contributed 10 basis points of growth, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 140 basis points. Segment-level adjusted operating margin was 23%, including a core operating margin increase of 190 basis points driven by the continued strong volume at GVR and solid performance at Matco. ","Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew high single digits, led by mid-teens growth in North America. GVR delivered low double-digit core revenue growth, highlighted by a mid-teens increase in developed markets. GVR's performance in North America was paced by sustained momentum from EMV-related sales, while growth in Western Europe reflected a combination of continued share gains and significant service rollouts with Costco during the quarter. GVR posted flat growth across high-growth markets as strong performance in Latin America was offset by continued delays from automation project rollouts in India as well as a large dispenser tender for which expected delivery has been shifted into the fourth quarter. Despite these short-term dynamics, GVR continues to build on its strong position within high-growth markets. In India, in particular, the strong order momentum and a healthy backlog provide good visibility into the region's sustained growth in the coming quarters. ","GVR recently launched Passport Express Lane, adding a self-checkout system optimized for convenience stores to its Passport suite of solutions. GVR also launched a new family of products for Insite360 called HALO, which provide a significant upgrade to the system's fuel logistics functionality. During the third quarter, we made a follow-on investment in Tritium as we continued to support the company's rapid growth. GVR also recently announced the integration of a credit card reader into Tritium's high-speed EV charging stations, enhancing payment functionality to include credit card, debit card and contactless payment methods. ","TeletracNavman performed in line with expectations, generating a low-teens core revenue decrease in the third quarter as continued strong growth across Asia Pacific was more than offset by the company's performance across North America and Western Europe. The key priority for the TeletracNavman team remains the stabilization of its business in North America as it addresses the high level of customer churn over the past 12 months and returns the company to a sustainable growth trajectory. We continue to see improvements in our customer-related metrics, including the level of customer churn. ","Moving to Franchise Distribution. The platform's core revenue grew low single digits during the third quarter as low single-digit growth at Matco was partially offset by a low single-digit decline at Hennessy. Matco was led by another strong quarter of growth in hardline tools, offset by some slowing in tool storage. Matco continues to see good traction with new product introductions, highlighted by the recent launch of a new half-inch air impact wrench, with a market-leading combination of power and control in a lightweight design that makes it significantly easier for the technician to handle. ","Before turning to the guide, as we look ahead to 2020, we are mindful of the challenging macroeconomic environment and are therefore planning to increase our spending on a range of strategic productivity initiatives by approximately $45 million in the fourth quarter. These initiatives will better position us to deliver sustained earnings growth while maintaining investments to drive future growth and innovation. ","We are updating our full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.42 to $3.47, representing a year-over-year growth of 12% to 13% on a continuing operations basis. The revised annual guide reflects the headwinds faced by our Professional Instrumentation segment due to the short-cycle slowing dynamics that became more pronounced in the third quarter and which we expect to persist through the end of the year. The revised guidance assumes 1% to 2% core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. ","We are also initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.96 to $1.01, representing year-over-year growth of 5% to 11%. This includes assumptions of flat core revenue growth, flat core OMX and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. ","To wrap up, during the third quarter, we delivered high-teens earnings growth with strong free cash flow even as the macroeconomic backdrop became more challenging. The quarter demonstrated the powerful earnings contribution from the acquisitions we have added over the past few years, which are also increasing the resilience of our portfolio as they compound and become a larger share of our total revenue. Despite short-cycle slowing in the headwinds we expect to persist into next year, we continue to execute our capital allocation strategy to drive further portfolio transformation, build a better, stronger Fortive and create greater long-term value for employees, customers and shareholders. ","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin.","Griffin Whitney","Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Philip, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Tusa","So can you just help us a little bit with parsing out the acquisition? How much of an impact on margin and then maybe easier, just like what was the negative earnings impact from stuff that ran through from the deal that you closed in the third quarter, if there was any?","Charles McLaughlin","In the third quarter, the deal expenses, on our adjusted earnings side, there's nothing in there that ran through there. And there really wasn't any headwinds related to the acquisitions. And the headwinds we faced were largely about the slowing of the top line as we progressed through the quarter.","Charles Tusa","Okay. And then when it comes to the deal that you were planning to contribute this year like Gordian and Accruent, I think ASP is kind of a bit of a standout. That seems to be on track. Just remind us what you said they were going to contribute at the beginning of the year. And is that still the case here that they're going to contribute the same amount? Or is the Accruent comment that you made, I think it was Accruent you made a comment around, is that slowing having an impact on what those were ultimately going to contribute?","Charles McLaughlin","So I think that the ASP is -- continues to be right on track on that at $0.20. And I think the -- what we said in the beginning of the year is, I have to go back and look, but $0.24 to $0.28 for the year. And I think when we get there, they're largely intact. Keep in mind that probably 1\/3 of the OP from those things are in the fourth quarter. So I think that we're -- we continued in that range.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Maybe we could start with the market conditions. And I know you picked your words carefully in the prepared remarks, but you said the short-cycle slowing intensified. And then if I heard you correctly, did you say that you expect some of the slowness to persist into next year? So take us through the cadence of the quarter and then what this means in terms of outlook for 2020. I know you're not giving specific guidance, but just in terms of how long this persists.","James Lico","Yes. Sure. Thanks, Deane. So I would -- it's Jim, by the way. I would say that -- a couple of things. One, just take us back to where we're at in July. What we saw in July was mostly what we thought to be inventory correction in our point-of-sale in places like Fluke and Pac, where we have the best visibility. Point-of-sale was still holding in there pretty well in June, but our sales into those channel partners was generally slower. So we saw it as a destocking mostly. ","As we progressed through the quarter, we increasingly saw the degradation of point-of-sale. And I think that's what led us to what we believe to be true now is this will continue to persist. And so our guide for the year really reflects what we've seen in terms of degradation on the point-of-sale side. ","I'd also say that we're starting to see it in our direct business as well in some places. So it's not just a channel situation. And typically, and I think this is probably more a Fluke common theme because of knowing the history there is that the smaller channel partners tend to be down more than the bigger ones, too. So that's a dynamic that we typically see in maybe a more protracted slowdown than just a quarter or 2. ","To your question about how does -- what's our view of next year. I think you step back and you look at we really took a significant look at where we're at, and the productivity initiatives that we announced, the $45 million, I think really have a construct in which we think a number of these things continue into next year. So I don't have a crystal ball for the full year right now nor would I want to try to provide that. I think it's fair to say that when we snapped the line on the calendar, things aren't probably likely to change all that much, and that it's least likely that the first quarter and probably into the second quarter, a number of these things continue. And that's sort of our thought process at this point.","Deane Dray","Great. I appreciate that color in terms of the expectations. And could you flesh out a bit on this restructuring initiative? This is right out of the Danaher playbook. Year-end restructuring, set yourself up for a stronger, leaner, coming year. The $45 million, what, in terms of cash, might that be? How much is headcount? Is there rooftops? And just some color there would be helpful.","Charles McLaughlin","Hey, Deane, this is Chuck. I think the returns we'd expect on that would be under a year on that $45 million. I think that it's -- there's a number of different places as we saw slowing in the quarter, initiatives across the businesses, primarily where we're seeing slowing. So more focus on the PI. Beyond that, given that we're just rolling those things out at the operating companies, I think we'll leave the details for another day.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just a question around the sort of the Q3 performance and the Q4 guidance. So in the third quarter, you had 2% core growth and a slight decline in core margins. Q4, you're guiding for flat core sales and a flat core margin. So I just wondered, with that slowdown in the top line that you've talked about, why don't we see that core margin pressure increase in Q4? Is it something to do with mix within the 2 segments or something around the tariff timing impact a year ago? Maybe just help us understand that margin dynamic. And maybe to put a point on it, the adjusted margin in Q3 was 21.3%. Just to clarify, if you can, what's the number for Q4?","Charles McLaughlin","Sure. First, I'll take the adjusted margin percentage in Q4 raises to 22.1% for the full company. I think the main thing, mix plays certainly a part of it and can give you some variations on the flat OMX. But I think when you look back to last year, in Q4, we had some onetime things that aren't repeating, and so that gets us to a little bit better than what we saw in Q3. But if you look back over Q2 to Q3, it's been flat.","James Lico","Julian, I think it also reflects what you saw in the third quarter, what -- this sort of slowdown through the quarter. We're much more prepared from a fourth quarter standpoint for that slowdown. And so what you also see is us taking action and the impact of those actions actually really having more impact on the quarter. So it's what -- it's certainly the -- we've got some slightly easier comps on the tariffs too as you accurately pointed out, but it's also this ability for us to get after. ","The free cash flow in the third quarter was so strong, we were certainly prepared on the working capital side. And I think we're better prepared on the P&L side in the fourth than, say, we were in the third.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. And then maybe just my follow-up around capital deployment. You've announced the split will happen 9 to 12 months from now. You've also got some restructuring underway today because of the slowing top line. Given those two aspects, do you think it's plausible that you would have much M&A activity in the coming two or three quarters? Or the view is you have a lot on your plate and so maybe M&A takes a backseat for a while.","James Lico","Well, I would say, first, we certainly would agree with the point that we have a focus on a number of things that are really important. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, both the ASP integration and the separation into NewCo are going well, and that certainly takes time and resources and energy. So we would certainly vehemently agree that as a prioritization, those things are top of mind and things that Chuck and I and the rest of the management team are certainly focused on and really on a daily basis. ","We announced -- we've done 3, really, if you think about from the second quarter. In the second quarter, we closed ASP. We've done SAFER. We've done Intelex. We've done PR\u00dcFTECHNIK. And of course, today, we announced the Sensus deal, so 4 deals in the better part of 90 days. So we've been pretty active. And we're certainly very focused on the integration of those things. ","So I think Sensus is a good example. We -- as I mentioned at a couple of the conferences recently, we'd be more likely to be focused on anything if we did something to be bolt-on-ish and -- or maybe adjacent that's within the real strategic side. And I think Sensus represents that. In many respects, it's adjacent to exactly what we do in Sterilization. It's sort of like how Intelex is akin to ISC. It's very much akin to what we do at ASP. So I think we'll be focused on those kinds of transactions. If they're right down the middle of the fairway, we would be acting on them. But we do have a focus on a number of these things. And while I wouldn't say we're not focused on M&A, I think it's safe to say that the M&A we've done is pretty considerable here recently.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","So you did highlight North American slowdown in PI. And I was just wondering what specific end markets would you attribute the slowdown to.","James Lico","Yes, I would say -- well, first, in terms of location, we said it was -- I would say we certainly saw where we were -- if I think about Fluke, Fluke was -- Fluke Industrial in particular, our Fluke Networks business as well, those are 2 places in North America. So that was relatively broad-based, but you could certainly see where industrial customers were slower. We don't have a lot of automotive exposure, but we have manufacturing certainly in those numbers. And you'd see some of those places are just some examples of where you might see a little bit more end-market slowing. ","Certainly, electronics would be the other place where we saw it. So whether that's anyone assembling or designing electronics, we saw a little bit slower markets. And that's a channel dynamic as much as anything. So those are some end markets. I think where we stood up, where we had innovation, we continue to do pretty well from a product perspective. The II900, the Sonic Imager, we announced last quarter at Fluke, did exceptionally well in the quarter. Our thermal imaging product line did pretty well in the quarter. ","So where we have some innovation, we still saw some opportunities. So I think the key for us is to continue to find those places where there's opportunity and really utilize prioritization in what we call dynamic resource allocation to put our resources in some of those end markets.","I would say that when we look at places like where we have software conversions of SaaS, things are really well. So eMaint's a great example, is while the end market might be similar to some of the places that are slowing from an instrument standpoint, we're still seeing a lot of SaaS conversion in those end markets with maintenance software. We mentioned eMaint grew over 20% for another quarter in a row, and their performance was outstanding. So where we have those SaaS conversions, Andrew, I would say, the end market almost doesn't matter. We're still doing pretty well.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question on Tektronix. There's been some headlines that we're seeing stabilization in sort of semiconductor markets specifically. Is that a -- has your view changed on that until fourth quarter next year? Are you seeing any signs of stabilization? Does it matter for Tektronix where we are right now?","James Lico","I think it's still a little early for us to call stabilization. I would say, on the capital front, the onesie-twosie stuff might be something that continues. But some of the bigger projects, like our Keithley business has a decent bellwether there. We still haven't seen a big upturn or maybe even a flattening yet. So I think we're still at least a quarter -- I've heard some of the same things, but I think we're definitely not planning for any of that in the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Jim or Chuck, you said you had 150 basis points of price this quarter, which seems like a good deal on price. But could you talk about the trade-off between price versus cost across the company? I know you lapped tariff in Q3, but did you have positive prices for cost in Fluke and Tektronix in particular? And if you didn't, how quickly could the thing catch up with cost in those segments? And what should it look like for the company moving forward?","James Lico","Yes, I think both at Fluke and at Tek in the quarter, we beat the corporate average from a price standpoint. I think we're still a little behind on the price-cost dynamic at both those places. We've got some cost reductions that have offset some of those. But from just a pure price tariff, Andy, we're still lagging a little bit relative to that. ","And I think as we go into the year, that obviously tapers a little bit because we've sort of started to sunset some of the tariffs in the fourth quarter. Because even though the tariffs were announced last year in the third, they really hit in the fourth and in the first. So we'll start to see a little bit of that. That could be a better. But unfortunately, the volume reductions sort of wipe out a lot of that as well. ","So on the one hand, we've got the right price-cost, but that's sort of a static metric. It doesn't really have a volume dynamic to it. If you were to kind of look at it on a volume basis, we probably lost a little bit more on the gross margin front from just the volume reduction.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Jim, that's helpful. And then -- sorry, go ahead.","James Lico","No, I was going to say, and so if volume comes back, then we'd start to see things maybe ramp a little bit better. But right now, we're not anticipating any big volume comeback here in at least the rest of the year.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. That's helpful. And then Western Europe, I think you said grew slightly, which was better than last quarter's low single-digit decline. You were watching Western Europe then carefully. So some of your peers have mentioned maybe even some stabilization in Europe as the quarter went on. Is this just GVR doing well in Europe for you guys, and we should still kind of watch the PI businesses there, the short-cycle businesses there? Or did you see any stabilization?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, Andy. I think we did see some stabilization across the businesses. It's beyond just EVR. But I think that we remain watchful of everything that's going on in Europe, and this was a slightly bigger quarter than maybe we saw it coming in. But we're still watching it pretty carefully.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Could you just remind us, Jim, on Gordian and Accruent, just because these are kind of going organic more recently? I guess specifically for Gordian on some of these larger projects, is that revenue cycle tied more toward when these projects kick off or when they ramp up? And I guess where the question's going is if some of that underlying activity slows a little bit more, is there still kind of an extensive backlog where projects wrap up and they still get paid? Or is that more of kind of the leading edge of the project cycle?","James Lico","Yes. I mean there's certainly a component to it of you signed -- the way -- you got to get the cost structure going through the job order contracting mechanism. So you're right, there is a point where at the start, it's not as great as it is maybe through -- the first 1\/3 probably isn't as great as the -- there is a ramp to that as more costs come through. And you'll probably get more at the end than you do at the beginning. ","The one thing about it though is -- and one of the interesting dynamics about the businesses is that because we don't really play in the massive construction cycle, it's really more about the rebuilds and the redos and the maintenance stuff. It doesn't really have a big component to it of large-scale construction. And in fact, when things slow a little bit, people tend to fix stuff more, and it actually is a pretty good dynamic for the business. So the combination of that and of being underpenetrated means that I think we still have a lot more opportunity in the business going forward despite what the economic cycle might look like.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Understood. And then, I guess, just a second question on GVR, obviously heading into a tougher comp here into the fourth quarter. EMV though is kind of reaching its time to shine in that whole adoption cycle. Can you help us kind of calibrate what the push and pull of those two dynamics are, the tough comp versus closer to the transition period?","James Lico","Yes. Well, we had a really good third quarter there as we said. I think in North America, I would -- because of slightly -- we certainly have a tougher comp in the fourth quarter, so it's probably closer to high single digit for the -- we'd probably see India -- we mentioned in the prepared remarks that India would -- we had a number of projects push into the fourth quarter. So I suspect our high-growth market numbers will be better in the fourth quarter there, and our North America number will be a little bit different just because -- in part because of the tougher comp, but not because of the overall demand, which we see continue to be good.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Walsh","Maybe just following up on that last question. Could you actually help us with the organics you're expecting in Q4? Obviously, you gave us the total company. But there is that comp and the India dynamic. I mean maybe asked differently, I mean, can IT actually grow in Q4 '19?","James Lico","Yes, IT will grow and probably in the mid single-digit ranges if we were to sort of think about that. And I think what we'll see in PI is probably still down a little bit. So pretty close, maybe because of the tougher comp, a little bit lower than what we've seen in the third quarter.","John Walsh","Great. And then going back to the prepared remarks, I think for Accruent, you made this comment that you'd signed up 70 new customers in the quarter. I was wondering if you could help provide some context around that number and how to think about it. And maybe building off of Josh's question, when things slow, I think there's a penetration rate story here, particularly for both Accruent and Gordian. I mean maybe how does -- where do you see the penetration rates of those solutions in the market and then how to think about signing up 70 customers? I'm just not sure how to actually think about how to term that business.","James Lico","Yes. That makes sense. John, I would say a couple of things. One, maybe talk about the Gordian thing first, just to tie that off. I think we're very -- that -- the market is very underpenetrated. Again, that's not a SaaS business. It's really more a new business model in terms of job order contracting. So there's a lot of growth. We have to invest in that growth by adding salespeople and building capability. And we've put some additional investments in the business this year in order to do that. We're seeing the business grow. I'm getting good returns off those investments. ","Accruent today is -- has a larger installed base and is also more of a -- has more of a license revenue model that they're converting to SaaS. So while SaaS is still a large proportion of the sales today, they still have a conversion going on. So part of the little bit of the noise in the quarter with Accruent that we don't have in some of our other software businesses is this transition to SaaS. And so the 70 new customers is a good number because it demonstrates that we're adding customers, and that's a good thing. ","But I think the other thing in the prepared remarks was the average contract value going up, and that average contract value going up, or what we would call ACV, is really a demonstration that we're converting people to SaaS, and they're doing that over a longer-term contract. And so that's -- those are both positive signs for the long-term growth of the business. ","Of course, when you make that conversion of SaaS in a particular quarter or with a few months left in the year, it's not going to be as beneficial as getting a big subscription -- or excuse me, getting a big license contract. But over time, it's remarkably better and certainly from a margin perspective. ","So that's really the dynamics going on in the business. And overall, we're seeing good progress. And I think the 70 number, I think if there are over 50 new customers a quarter, we're feeling pretty good about that number. Now of course, as the customer base gets bigger, we'll have to raise expectations on that, but I suspect the team there will be raising it before we are.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.","Richard Eastman","Just a question. The reference has been made frequently to the PI businesses, the short-cycle, short-turns businesses. And if I try to hang a number on those, I mean, what -- how much revenue is there? I mean I'd size it. Is it close to $2 billion between Tek and Fluke Industrial? You kind of use different definitions there. I'm just curious what that looks like. And the point that you make about the POS kind of slowing here through the quarter, do you have a good read on the channel there in those two businesses?","James Lico","Yes. So I think two questions there. If you took Fluke and Fluke all off, which Fluke Health, Fluke Networks, that remains there, Fluke Industrial, all of the -- Fluke Calibration, all those, you're in the -- and combine that with Tektronix, you're roughly a little over $2 billion in revenue. So that's a decent number. $2 billion, $2.1 billion, I think probably is a good number there. ","Relative to -- I think we have the best visibility. We get point-of-sale data in the U.S., Europe and China for both businesses. I think we have better granularity in North America. And increasingly, as you get farther from the U.S., the numbers become less of the total sales and they come maybe a little bit more less perfect. But North America is pretty good. Fluke, we get better -- we probably get the best data because we get multiple -- we get a multiple industry look. It's often been called the \"canary in the coal mine.\" And so I think we get decent visibility. ","And that's why we said, in June, the point-of-sale data actually looked decent. It was really the third quarter where we progressively saw -- we saw more of a destocking activity going on in June. What we saw in the third quarter was -- we still saw some destocking, but we also saw really actual demand going down.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just my follow-up question is around ASP. You did reference some of the investments there and some of that going into new products and product launch for 2020. But given the timing there, I don't know if you need 510(k) for any of that. Probably not. But just my question is, do you have a pipeline of new products, and given the timing, that can move the needle on growth in ASP as soon as 2020?","James Lico","Well, first of all, whenever we would talk about a new product launch with ASP, we would be including the FDA approval that would be required. So when we talk about 2020, we're talking about the actual launch of products. So whether it's the FDA or the -- their -- the appropriate organization elsewhere in the world, we would always be talking about launching a product with those approvals. So we won't talk about a launch before -- we would assume that when we give you a date, that we've got those kinds of approvals already in hand. So that's first and foremost. And we have been able to accelerate some things. We started doing some work even before, not necessarily helping them with product launches, but educating them around some of our tools of new product development. But they've also had their own innovation funnel and been doing their own things, too. So we think we're accelerating some of those things, and we'll start to see those in the -- next year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","I would like to better understand the pathway to PI margin stability, I guess. Chuck, I think you called out FX and tariffs as 2 headwinds. And of course, we've got some pretty big decremental margins at Tektronix and Fluke. The tax, you mentioned that they're kind of lapping 4Q. So are these largely List 2 tariffs, List 3, as that's important? It seems like FX is starting to stabilize, right? So perhaps, there's some good news there. I'm just curious, how do we sort of bend the curve on margins at PI in the absence of any good news on volumes? And maybe kind of like what I'm trying to get at here is, is most of the restructuring you're doing centered around PI?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, I think there's a couple of quick things. There is -- keep in mind, the tariffs, they ramped through last year as they were implemented. So when -- even though we're lapping at the start of tariffs, I think the lapping starts around the first of the year when its so like-for-like come out. So that will give us some stabilization. ","I agree that there's still a little bit of FX headwind in the year, but that's starting -- hopefully, that will remain stable. But I do think that some of the restructuring that -- or the -- that we're doing that we just announced is primarily focused in PI and not all because we have slowing in a number of places. But I think that's going to be helpful there. And don't forget that ASP is sitting in Professional Instrumentation as well, and that should give us some lift there as well.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That brings me then into the next question, which is the TSA roll-off at ASP. Can you maybe quantify kind of to what extent that's a problem right now? And what impact is that to margin? I've got a number of maybe $15 million to $20 million per quarter in my head. Is that a good number going forward?","Charles McLaughlin","I think that when we get down the road and we're entirely off the TSAs, yes, I think that, that will be a quarter number. I don't -- I wouldn't actually call it a problem in that it's playing out as we expected. But I think it's an opportunity that we expect to move forward with. And so I feel pretty good about it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.","John Inch","I think you both said Tektronix and Fluke Industrial were down high single digits, and obviously, the shift has been much more at the point-of-sale. I'm not sure if you know or can kind of granularly or more granularly comment on the degree of destock, like is destock getting better. And do you guys think that Tek and Fluke have hit sort of low watermarks in terms of their core growth degradation? Or based on sort of the cadence of end markets, it seems like this is just kind of beginning to hit in North America. Are things potentially going to get worse here in the short run?","James Lico","Well, I think we said, North America, Fluke Industrial was high single digits in the quarter. So that's a pretty -- you got to -- you can come up with a lot of different scenarios around what the economic situation looks like. But I think given what we saw progress through the quarter, that idea that it will progress, that it will continue for a period of time is really the basis by which we took the productivity initiatives. ","So I think we don't expect anything to come back and return. And the sales in is sort of equating to the sales out now. So at some point in time, we'll see some inventory lift, but we're not planning any inventory lift. And I wouldn't expect that well into next year. So I think we're prudent where we're at right now, John. Certainly, we could come up with a scenario where maybe it gets worse. But I think, right now, from everything we're seeing, having this idea that it progresses or continues and certainly into next year is, I think, is the most accurate thing. ","And it seems, as we've listened to other peers, it seems similar from an end-market perspective. We're seeing some similar things. So we'll try -- we try to triangulate off of that as well.","John Inch","That makes sense. And then can we also just -- could you guys maybe -- I don't know if there's any sort of an update you can give us with respect to the time line of events for separation. So I'm thinking you were going to talk about, maybe at some point, the expected capital structure of both of the companies. At some point, we're going to get a management for NewCo, et cetera, then there's a road show. What -- are there any milestones that we should be looking for coming up in the next few months?","James Lico","Well, I think -- yes, I mean, it's very early days. I -- but I like -- as we meant -- said in the prepared remarks, I think we made some really good progress. I would say we filed registration statements. We've gotten commentary from the SEC. We've responded to that feedback. So at having done a few of these in my life now, the -- what I call the real work, the groundwork you got to do from a filing perspective, from a subsidiary standpoint, from a pretax work, we've made a lot of progress in the last several months. ","Obviously, we just announced it 5 or 6 weeks ago, but I think those comments would suggest we've been hard at work for much longer than that. And we're certainly building the management team. We're building a Board. We're doing a number of those things. And they really all need to come at one time, if you will. So I don't want to put a predictive time on that. But certainly, I wouldn't think -- I would think we'll certainly be talking about that by the end of the year, early part of next year for, I think, with pretty good specificity. ","We've announced the location. We're going to put the headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina -- or Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, sorry about that. So the -- so we've got a location, and we're -- and that's something we're doing. So we've made a number of -- we've made progress on a number of fronts, and we feel good about where we're at. ","And as we bring everything else along, we'll have an opportunity to continue to share things as they come out. But I think that's really probably the early part of next year where we come up with some of the -- where we can come out with -- maybe that's the next major milestone. And maybe that's tied to earnings announcement or somewhere in around there, too.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.","Andrew Buscaglia","Can you talk a little bit more about ASP? So it's been in your numbers for a couple of quarters now. Can you talk about where you are with regards to FBS initiatives, first off, kind of what inning you're there? And with regards to the margin contribution, can you talk to -- can you try to quantify that in -- within the quarter and then potentially how that progresses through next year?","James Lico","Sure. So Andrew, we'll -- Chuck and I can tag-team that. I think we're very pleased with the work that's been done on the Fortive Business System with the team there. We've made good progress. We've done a number of things. I mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the innovation efforts we've had. We've also had a number of value-selling and funnel management workshops with them. We've taught them daily management. We've done some Kaizens in the factory as well. So we've made some nice progress with adoption of FBS in -- while -- and it's really early days. I was -- a couple of weeks ago, I was with the teams in China and in Japan. And those teams are really integrating, while we mentioned China is going to come on to our direct control here in a few weeks. ","So we're making good progress, and the teams are very thirsty for adopting FBS. The work that's been done, I think, suggests that having their hands on a continuous improvement system and a set of tools has been something that they've been looking forward to. And so far, adoption is very early days. As we know, this is a multi, multiyear journey. But having done this a number of times, I think we're off to a pretty good start.","Charles McLaughlin","And Andrew, this is Chuck. With the -- regards to the margins, adjusted operating margins, I think at this point, are nominally accretive. But as we were off in the TSAs, you'll see a significant lift in benefit from us over the next year from ASP for the total Fortive.","Andrew Buscaglia","Right. Okay. And is there any incentive to move some of those FBS stuff forward pre-spin?","James Lico","I think what you -- are you talking about the -- at ASP or just more...","Andrew Buscaglia","Yes. ASP, yes, specifically. Like is there a -- yes...","James Lico","I think the road maps for what we need to do in both businesses, both the separation and ASP integration, they really have independent paths. And we're working super hard and super well to get those done as quickly as possible. But the reality is they're both on separate paths. And they'll find the fact that we talk about, one, at the end of -- at the end of the first half and the other one in the second half. That's just sort of -- it just happens to be that way. We're very much running pretty hard. I don't anticipate opportunities to do much sooner on either one of those because of the work that we have ahead of us. The good news is we're making good progress along those paths now.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano","Do you have any color on core OMX growth by segment next quarter?","Charles McLaughlin","Well, I think, in general, it's going to look an awful lot like what we saw this quarter for core OMX. I think that when you look at our adjusting operating margins, I think both PI and IT will be around 23%, with the overall company in 20%, 22%.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And then on the SaaS transition for Accruent, how long does something like that generally take? And I know it's a good development long-term, but sometimes, it's going to be a tough transition as it happens. So how long does that business take to transition over?","James Lico","Yes. We'll continue to do. I think what we really built on our return model was that it would occur over a couple -- 2 to 3 years. Not every customer -- we're not forcing a transition by any stretch of imagination. There's certain value that's created, particularly as people move to the cloud and have different thoughts around how they want to handle their IT transitions in some of these markets. So it's certainly a continued 2- to 3-year transition. And I don't think there's anything that will precipitate a massive change to that. And it's certainly -- well, it might move around. The core growth rate might move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter here. But we still sit in that, the mid- to high single-digit growth rates that we'll see in those -- the combined business here, certainly through -- certainly over the next few years with having those transitions.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","James Lico","Well, thanks, everybody, and Philip, thank you. Thanks, everybody, for taking the time. I know it's an incredibly busy day. I understand there were some challenges with EDGAR even today. So -- on getting some documents. So our information is on the web, on our website, if you weren't able to do that. I'm sure that you'll all figure out what they have going. ","But thanks so much for the time. We obviously feel that we've taken a number of steps. I know this is a volatile environment with a lot of change going on relative to the end markets. But we feel very good about what we've done from a free cash flow perspective and earnings perspective in the quarter and really are working hard to make sure that we can implement some of the things to not only protect our earnings for next year, but also to make sure that we do what we call dynamic resource allocation, which is to make sure we can continue to prioritize the investments that are going to have the most dramatic impact on our core growth and our margin expansion in the years to come. ","So we'll look forward to continuing to talk to all of you there. Obviously, Griffin and Chuck and Ross are available for questions, will be available when needed to answer any follow-ups. Thanks for the time, and good luck in the remaining days and weeks of earnings. Thanks, everybody. Have a great night.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lisa Curran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Curran, you may begin your conference.","Lisa Curran","Thank you, Ian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With me today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today\u2019s call. Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information.","A replay of the webcast will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call until Friday, February 23, 2018. Instructions rather for accessing this replay are included in our fourth quarter 2017 earnings press release.","During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future.","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","The Tax Cut and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The tax reform among other things reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transaction tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.","As of December 31, 2017 we have not completed the accounting for the tax effects of tax reform. However pursuant to the guidance by the SEC, we have made a reasonable estimate as the effect of tax reform on our financial results for the period ended December 31, 2017. These estimated amounts are provisional and are subject to adjustment.","In addition, certain of our historical non-GAAP financial measures for 2017 including adjusted EPS and free cash flow conversion ratio excludes the estimated provisional impact of the tax reform.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Lico","Thanks Lisa, and good afternoon everyone.","The fourth quarter closed out a defining year with continued outperformance and strong execution by our team and positions us well for long-term success. The Fortive Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage driving market share gains, strong core margin expansion, and robust free cash flow generation.","2017 adjusted earnings per share of $2.89 grew 15% driven by 4.5% core revenue growth and 110 basis points of core operating margin expansion or 55 points excluding the benefit from lower amortization.","As a reminder, in early 2017 we outlined our strategic prior and I'm pleased to report that we have met or exceeded all of them. In addition to delivering double-digit earnings growth, accelerated core growth we delivered free cash flow conversion of 107% for the year.","We launched game-changing technologies across the company including the Tektronix 5 Series mixed-signal oscilloscope and the Fluke T6 non-contact voltage electrical tester. We made important strides advancing Fluke and Salix, Gilbarco Veeder-Root Insite360 and telematics digital strategies. We grew market share at many of our businesses including Fluke, IFC, Tektronix, Qualitrol, Setra, Kollmorgen and Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We increased high-growth market sales as a percentage of total revenue by 150 basis points and delivered strong double-digit growth in the year.","Lastly, we deployed $1.6 billion towards strategic acquisitions and we made successful strides towards enhancing our portfolio to having more recurring revenue, less cyclicality and higher exposure to quality end market and secular growth drivers.","These important outcomes demonstrate that we're realizing our vision at Fortive as a diversified industrial growth company and that we remain focused on building a better stronger Fortive aligned with our portfolio goals. The Fortive formula is clearly delivering differentiated performance and we are well positioned to continue to post strong results in 2018 and beyond.","With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the details of the fourth quarter. Our adjusted net earnings of $288.6 million were up 21% over the prior year representing the fourth consecutive quarter digit earnings growth. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.82 which excludes among other item of $70.3 million net after tax gain reflecting the effects of tax reform.","Effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%. Sales grew 11% to $1.8 billion including a core revenue increase of 3%. The contribution from acquisitions substantially accelerated to 590 basis points of growth reflecting the success of our capital deployment and positions us well for future organic growth.","These strong results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio, industry leading technology, continued performance and high growth markets and further growth acceleration in industrial and markets in North America. The breadth of growth across the portfolio was very strong with two-thirds of our operating companies growing mid single digits or better.","Geographically high growth markets core revenue grew mid single digits with continued strength across Asia and growth in Latin America. Double digit growth in China was led by business wins at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Kollmorgen, Fluke and sensing technologies.","Developed markets core revenue grew low single digits driven by Western Europe and improved performance in North America led by high single digit growth at Tektronix and Fluke reflecting new product innovations, strong commercial execution through the Fortive business system and an improved industrial economy.","We posted a record gross margin of 50.4%, an increase of 140 basis points over last year, as we applied FBS fundamentals, drove strong PBV and price performance. Five out of our six strategic platforms delivered positive pricing for a net contribution of 70 basis points.","Operating profit margin was 19.7% in the quarter with core operating margin expansion of 50 basis points. During the fourth quarter, we generated a record $450 million of free cash flow and delivered a seasonally strong conversion ratio of 156%.","Turning to our segments, professional instrumentation posted sales growth of 17.5% with core revenue growth of 5.6%. Acquisitions contributed 960 basis points and favorable currency 230 basis points, core operating margin expanded 120 basis points with reported operating margin of 21.5%.","Advanced instrumentation and solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter lead by market share gains at Fluke and Tektronix. Field Solutions core revenue was up mid single digits with similar growth in both developed and high growth markets and led by high single digit growth at Fluke.","Fluke's high single digit core growth reflected continued high growth market performance and accelerated growth in developed markets. Core growth was broad based across businesses driven by market share gains and new technology penetration. Fluke launched last quarter of the T6 family of Electrical Testers with field sense technology that substantially exceeded our expectations and continues to be recognized with several industry awards, including top honors at the International Air Conditioning Heating Refrigerating Exposition 2018 Innovation Awards.","The T6 testers are the first tool to eliminate the need to make contact with electrical conductors which reduces the potential for earth clash and significantly increases electrician safety. Our growth investments and capital deployed into executing the Field Solution strategy has accelerated our connected devices initiatives and technology leadership and enabled us to enter targeted adjacent markets like healthcare.","On that note, I am very pleased with the early integration process with Landauer as we leverage their channel to market and expand our health solutions footprint. Going forward we will refer to the combination of foot biomedical and Landauer as Fluke health solutions.","IFC delivered double digit in the first full quarter within the field solutions portfolio. This performance was driven by strong iNet growth, channel expansion and high growth markets and multiple new product introductions including the radius hazardous gas area monitor. Radius can detect up to 7 gases at the largest display of any area monitor on the market and utilizes dual sense technology to increase worker safety by using two sensors to detect the same gas.","Cultural core growth declining low single digits as double digit growth in North America was more than offset by declines in Europe and the Middle East and prior year project timing in China. As we shared with you last quarter, challenges in the Middle East continued to delay budget approvals also impacting Europe OEMs. We expect this softness in the Middle East to continue into the first quarter of 2018 which should be more than offset by strong backlog.","Moving to product realization, platform core revenues were up mid single digits for the quarter, led by growth of Tektronix. Tektronix\u2019s high single digit core revenue growth was led by double digit growth and oscilloscopes primarily driven by Tektronix 4 Series, MSO penetration and multiple business wins and target segments including the data center in [indiscernible].","Sales performance of the Tektronix 5 Series mixed signal oscilloscope has continue to exceed our expectations and win multiple industry awards including product of the year by Electronics Product Magazine.","We also won several million dollar video order - several million order with a like TV streaming service provider to support expansion of OTT or Over-The-Top television services across North America. And as we announced earlier today, we are excited for another consecutive Olympics where we were selected by NBC Olympics to provide audio and video casting quality monitoring for the production of the Olympic Winter Games. ","Our Sensing technology platform delivered high single digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by share gains and target vertical and double digit growth and high growth markets. Stature continues to innovate and expand product offerings with particle counting and humidity. Bundling these new modalities with our flex and legacy pressure products positions us well in critical care environments.","We're also pleased with Anderson-Negele's large project wins in Pharma and Pet foods as we target other growth verticals outside of their core dairy market.","Moving to our industrial technology segment, revenue grew 5.6% with core revenue growth of 0.9% and sales from acquisitions contributing 270 basis points. Reported operating margin of 20.3% includes core operating margin expansion of 10 basis points. A transportation technology platform core revenue declined low single digits in the quarter, reflecting mid-single digit growth at Telematics offset by mid single digit decline in Gilbarco Veeder-Root.","At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, EMV continues to play out as we expected, as dispenser revenue declined reflecting a pause in the FB upgrades due to the delay in the liability shift to 2020. It's worth noting that the fourth quarter last year was the highest quarter for dispenser growth in company history. High growth markets core revenue grew low single digits led by double digit growth in China, reflecting continued demand at Veeder-Root for submersible pumps and automatic tank gauges related to double wall tank upgrades. Partially offset by tender timing in India.","During the quarter we won a 400 site point of sale bid with Matco, one of the largest independent chains in North America and overall point of sale core revenue growth improve sequentially reflecting share gains. We're also encouraged by expectations of customer CapEx investment solidifying in the second half of 2018.","Telematics posted core revenue growth of mid single digits led by strong SaaS sales growth continued increased installed base and improved performance in North America. The results are driven by the continued success of our new director platform utilizing FBS growth tools and digital marketing. We improved our mobile lead generation conversion rate by greater than 80% and reduced our ELD campaign cost per click by greater than 30%.","Sales growth also benefited from the strong adoption of electronic logging devices coinciding with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration mandate that went into effect December 18. While enforcement of the mandate doesn't go into full effect until April 1, and compliance requirements are still evolving, we continue to expect the see ELD as an opportunity to gain share and enter 2018 at a high single digit growth rate.","Automation and specialty grew core sales high single digits driven by continued double digit growth and high growth markets in robotic. Jacobs Vehicle Systems delivered mid teens core revenue growth driven by increased Class A truck production in the U.S.","Kollmorgen posted high single digit core growth reflecting strong demand in its industrial automation product line which was driven by continued robotic strength in Europe and China. I'm excited to report that the recent launch of Kollmorgen latest mobile robotic system software, NCA 3.0 is driving strong double digit sales. This technology lowers labor costs and increased productivity through vehicle automation used primarily in warehousing.","Thompson delivered mid single digit core revenue growth, led by double digit growth in China in Western Europe and industrial linear actuary sales. Franchise distribution core revenue grew low single digits, Matco core sales were flat as double digit growth and diagnostics was offset by continued softness in tool storage and a challenging hard line tool sales comparison. We see encouraging signs with improving distributor inventory levels and headcount.","Before turning to guidance, let me extend my personal thanks and gratitude to our Fortive colleagues around the world for their commitment to continuous improvement and living our shared purpose of delivering essential technology for the people who accelerate progress. It is our people who make Fortive and create our enduring culture that will continue to be the foundation of our success. It\u2019s our extraordinary teams that give us the confidence in our ability to build a great industrial growth company.","We are pleased with the meaningful progress we\u2019ve made in the last year advancing a number of our strategies around building a growth company from an organic and inorganic perspective. The M&A flywheel you heard me talk about many times, we're beginning to show itself with strong revenue growth and increased earnings. We remain focused on building a better stronger Fortive by utilizing our strong balance sheet to continue to execute our portfolio enhancement strategy.","With that said, we are raising our capital deployment today by announcing $5 billion of available acquisition capacity. As always it hard to predict the exact timing of deployment and resulting portfolio changes but I have more confidence today than ever that we\u2019re on a path for substantial smart capital allocation.","We're initiating our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.45 which includes our core revenue growth expectation of 3% to 4% and an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 20%. We anticipate core margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year and cash flow conversion of approximately 110%.","We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.72 to $0.76 which includes assumptions of low single digit core revenue growth and an estimated effective tax rate of 20%.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Lisa.","Lisa Curran","Ian, we're ready now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","So just on kind of the way that first half should trend in transportation tech, can you just give us a little bit of an update on how you expect that will come through?","Jim Lico","As we said in the prepared remarks the fourth came in around - how we\u2019ve been predicting it. We see the first quarter of 2018 similar to the fourth quarter. So we think that will play out and then as we progressively get through the year we\u2019ll continue to improve.","We would expect growth in the second half. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks we think CapEx will start to solidify at that point. I think we feel good about that right now and we\u2019ll see where things go as obviously as the year plays out.","Steve Tusa","And I guess you guys said $5 billion in acquisition kick capacity. Can you - is that something you can like to do immediately or is that just a commentary around what you feel like you have over the next three years?","Chuck McLaughlin","Steve that\u2019s probably a max capacity if we want to do everything this year. Obviously there\u2019re several assumptions built into that and you know that still with the assumption that we have a strong commitment to keep investment grade. So we just want to frame where we\u2019re at and what we felt we could do.","Steve Tusa","And then just lastly an update on the again sorry I didn\u2019t hear this in prepared remarks, an update on kind of the outlook for your business its related to semi CapEx, any signs of weakness there?","Chuck McLaughlin","Yes, well I think the price of most exposure that would be tech and particularly strong, a strong year - that really affect their China business the most. And we quite see a little bit of slowdown after three years of double-digit growth. We probably see a high single-digit like growth and China for them next year, but we still think 2018 will be a good year for tax relative to the exposure they have in semi which again is mostly in China.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research.","Scott Davis","I just want to clarify couple of things, when you said price was up 70 bps, was that net of cost or just that price of 70 and then your costs were up something comparable or how do you reconcile that?","Jim Lico","So 70 I would say we have very minimal inflation so we look at price cost pretty closely in every business and we're really are not seeing much inflation here. We've been able to mitigate almost all of it. So it might be a couple of points off that Scott I\u2019m not exactly sure what the number would be but it\u2019s minimal compared to 70 that we got.","Scott Davis","And how do you guys think about this EMV getting pushed out to 2020 I mean but we also have full 100% depreciation if guys spend the money now. Is there any chance if this stuff ends up getting pulled forward just because you guys can spend money now and our cash rich et cetera or does not matters as much in that market?","Jim Lico","The tax rate does help a lot in that industry. So I suspect that as individual businesses start to think about what their tax rate will be and the opportunities available to them. I think that will - we really haven't heard that yet in customer conversations but I suspect that still a conversation we had. I don't think it will be a massive pull forward, but I suspect what it does do and why we said it is that it will solidify the second half of 2018.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","The question goes to $5 billion in capacity, how do you guys think about your cost of capital in this environment where there are concerns about inflation. How do you think about what is your cost of capital in this environment and how will you adjust it over the year if we get inflation always going up.","Jim Lico","Well Andrew the way we look at as we think about returns first and we liked it - we always talked about getting for bolt-ons 10% return on capital, return on invested capital and maybe taking five years for maybe a little bigger deployment.","As far as the cost of capital the cost of debts going up, it doesn\u2019t really change ever still in that 8 range of cost of capital. We didn\u2019t change hurdle rates as interest rates went down and we\u2019re not really going to look in many different ways they go up.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow up on China, you touched on semiconductor equipment. Can you also talk about the truck market in China particularly if it relates to Jacobs because I think that's the key growth component there as well?","Jim Lico","I think it will be a little slow - it will certainly be slower in 2018 than it was in 2017 we had just a bang up year in 2017 for JVS. So it will slow a little bit for the business itself it will start to get made up by the U.S. so net-net it will still continue to be a good year for Jacobs. But yes China will slow a little bit for them. They\u2019ll also grow in China in 2018 but they won't have the really high double-digit growth that they've had it will mute a little bit.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dean Dray from RBC Capital Markets.","Dean Dray","Maybe start with Chuck. Where there any surprises in the tax reform application, Lisa made that emphasis that this was provisional. Was there anything unique to Fortive that you would highlight?","Chuck McLaughlin","No, we have the option the SEC gave us an unprecedented option to build or make it provisional and with the sheer complexity and volume of this it's just good sense to put up a provisional estimate. Having said that, we've done extensive work and we think we\u2019ve got very good number - a number her but by putting up a provisional it keeps means that we could make minor adjustments.","Dean Dray","And then just on tax reform as the potential second derivative changes. Do you have any sense that companies will be willing to divest non-core businesses now that tax leakage is less and so potential acquisitions for Fortive, but also within your own portfolio?","Jim Lico","I think certainly that would be speculation because it's pretty early obviously as people start to start to think through these things Dean. I would say that on balance, generally divestitures whether it's us or someone else tend to always be related to more strategic \u2013 decisions.","Certainly, with the tax rate being lower, it does make the financials look a little bit better. So I suspect on balance as we go through the year, we'll see others do that. And that will probably provide some additional opportunities. I think for us though \u2013 it's really about strategy, it's about our ability to grow the business long-term and what we can do with it. And those are really the real reasons for doing things, it\u2019s not because we could get a little bit more money on the sale. It's really about what's the long-term potential for success in the business over time.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Steve Winoker from UBS.","Steve Winoker","Could you maybe breakout that 3% to 4% core growth a bit across the businesses in terms of not just cadence, you talked that a little bit but between PI and IT, a little more detail?","Jim Lico","I think you'll see PI in the mid-single digit range you\u2019ll probably see IT in the low single-digit range. As far as the quarter, that'll probably even out more as we get longer through the year as Gilbarco turns to growth in the back half of year. But I just thought we\u2019ll see a little bit better growth out of PI. As we've said in the prepared remarks in the quarter, Fluke did very well and maybe more broadly but the industrial macro economy in North America has improved.","We've seen better point-of-sale in a number of our businesses that are more industrial related like Fluke and our sensors businesses and some of our automation businesses. So I suspect we'll see that certainly in the first part of the year which \u2013 we have a little bit of visibility to. So that gives you some sense. And as far as geographically, we think North America will be pretty good. If we take ex-Gilbarco and all the businesses in North America will be pretty good . And as I mentioned, we still think China is going to be good.","It may not necessarily tip the double-digit range every quarter this year, but we think China will continue to be good. We think India will be good for the year. Latin America has done a nice improvement here over the last couple of quarters. And while it's a really small base, we think that might be. So I gave you a geography view too, but maybe too much information, but hopefully it gives some perspective how \u2013 we think the year will play out at least kind of early days.","Steve Winoker","Jim, never too much information for us, that's great. And by the way, on that seasonality Q4 to Q1, if I \u2013 back out kind of the tax impact in Q4 and Q1, it does seem like a little bit less of a drop than we've seen in some prior years. Is that how you guys are thinking about it too, or are you looking for about the same?","Jim Lico","You're talking about the VCM?","Steve Winoker","Yes.","Jim Lico","A little bit. I think we're looking for it will be a little bit stronger versus Q4 in Q1. That's how we have models as well.","Steve Winoker","And then just lastly Jim as I'm staring at this $5 billion available M&A capacity, and I'm also thinking about the EMV air pocket that you're talking about and the kind of longer term, retail fueling opportunity and challenge. Is your thought that that M&A flywheel might mean like, and that $6.5 billion company today, that retail fueling if you kind of fast forward through that become moves from less than a quarter the revenue base to something significantly lower?","Jim Lico","Well, I don't know significant lower I think we've seen good, really good positions in the high growth markets. And so \u2013 a lot of talk about EVs we're seeing some of the largest tenders in the history of the company in places like India and other parts of Southeast Asia. So we're still seeing a lot of high growth market tender activity despite the conversations around electric vehicle. So I think high-growth market will be a bigger part of Gilbarco Veeder Root.","Over time, I think the transportation technologies will continue to look for and take advantage of opportunities that exist in the secular growth drivers that are beyond just retail fueling, like telematics, like smart cities and smart transportation, lot of money going into logistics and supply chain and warehousing. We're certainly taking advantage of some of those kind of trend at telematics. So I think as a business is a platform, there will be changes going on \u2013 and I suspect we'll continue to look at opportunities to take advantages of some of those longer-term drivers as well.","And so I feel really good about the platform in general. North America might be a little bit less in a pure dispenser perspective, but payment challenges will still be out there. I'm sure we're not going to get rid of credit card fraud anytime soon. Point-of-sale opportunities, those are still going to exist. So when you look around the portfolio, I think the revenue will probably change by product line and geography, but ultimately we still think there's opportunities there.","And more broadly, as we look at EV and AV for the company, we think there's as many opportunities for the company as anything. So with the changes that are required for the grid, for all the challenges of putting some \u2013 that sort of high power into opportunities for fast charging, those are going to provide opportunities for Fluke and Qualitrol and a number of our other businesses as well. So on balance, we see more opportunities and threat both with the combination of EV and AV and EMV trends that are going on in the market.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Were there any gains in this quarter? I'm trying to bridge the $0.82 versus the way we had modeled it, and not quite getting there. I'm just curious were there any kind of gains in the quarter to any degree?","Jim Lico","None in the adjusted earnings, you're talking about one-time gains?","John Inch","Yes I don't know if you had a business sale or anything like that that might be\u2026","Jim Lico","In the GAAP numbers, yeah, we've had on the interest. And other line, there's a $8 million gain on the sale of the building related to the Cons unit that was part of the NetScout sale if you go back again in time. So that's in there, but not in the adjusted numbers.","John Inch","It's not in the adjusted, okay. I'll pick it up offline. The PI core margins look pretty good, right the 120. The 10 basis points on the industrial technologies pressed a little wide, even though you did a percent of core growth. Was there anything else going on in that segment with respect to perhaps mix or something else? And where do you sort of see those VCMs trending, I guess, in the IT over the course of 2018?","Chuck McLaughlin","So in Q4, IT was lighter than normal, mostly because of the topline. And there's a little bit of timing. You can look back to last year where they had a tough compare. But to your fundamental question about what should we expect with the VCM going forward, 30 to 35 is a good number. If you just back up and look at their whole year, that's right where they're trending and that's what we'd expect going forward.","John Inch","For both segments, Chuck?","Chuck McLaughlin","Yes.","John Inch","Can I ask was there an FX impact on margins that you would call out that's noteworthy specific to say the fourth quarter that maybe run rates in a different cadence over the course of 2018?","Chuck McLaughlin","I think, no not really and there was a slight favorable, but it wasn't material I think you'll see in our bridge in the first half of 2018 that we'll see a couple of cents a quarter in Q1 and Q2. And then it tapers off.","John Inch","Just lastly, your software as a service, where did we end the year with respect to part of the revenue mix, and where you see it in 2018? Where would you like to end it based on new targets you had presented before?","Jim Lico","We've said we'd be in 20 to 25 range which I think is where we were through the year. I think we ended closer to 25 at the end of the year. I would expect that probably ticks up 200 or 300 basis points as we go through the year.","John Inch","Organically it ticks up like that?","Jim Lico","Yes, well, just because you get the full year fact of all the businesses we bought, plus the growth and things like inside 360 and some of those businesses.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi Group.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And so high growth markets have been growing double-digits for you over the last several quarters, but I think you mentioned it\u2019s a bit low to mid single-digit. Some of the issue is, I'm sure, more difficult comparisons going to happen. Good to see China still growing double-digits. But was it just the Middle East that slowed down significantly in Q4? And do you think the high growth markets grow mid-single digits or higher in 2018?","Jim Lico","So in the fourth quarter, you're exactly right. The Middle East was probably the big one. India too in the fourth was a little lower too because just some timing, tender timing that happens all the time. And so that we\u2019ll look past that we'll have a good year in India in 2018 that will \u2013 it moves around a little bit by quarter there. But, overall we're confident a good year in 2018.","So I think that's where in stand, I think the year will look as I said we\u2019ll slow a little bit in China probably to high single digits but by enlarge I think we\u2019ll continue to see good China, good India, Latin America will be good of a small base. So those - and I think Middle East as we noted in the prepared remarks a little bit at Qualitrol level we\u2019ll move through some of their challenges with some backlog, but - we\u2019ll be still slow in the Middle East I think in the first half.","Andrew Kaplowitz","You did mention strong backlog there in Qualitrol, does that help slip that business back to growth in the Middle East as you go in 2018?","Jim Lico","Yes, I think by the end of the year it does I\u2019m just thinking right now as they get through the year with some - obviously they are working off projected business that they have line of site too and right now that looks like they would be able to do that and be back to growth by the end of year.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And then last year you guys had I think $0.04 to $0.05 of productivity gains in your forecast for 2017 and obviously you don't have that in 2018, you have 30% to 35% of incremental. Is that because you just haven't done discrete restructuring here in 2017 and or could productivity gains actually be upside to your forecast or else equal?","Chuck McLaughlin","So no, we definitely continue to expect productivity gains we just didn\u2019t call it out on to the bridge and we kind of lump in to the other with interest and share price its actually it\u2019s a productivity gain it just got - because that was getting too many bars on that graph.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Group.","Jeff Sprague","Just one question on business related items and then just a couple financial things. Just Jim your optimism or signs of optimism that you\u2019re seeing in Matco in the tool business, can you elaborate a little bit on precisely what you're talking about, is it something in particular going or new products something?","Jim Lico","Well I think we saw something in the fourth quarter that led us to believe that things might be starting to get better. I wouldn\u2019t try to highlight that things are going to turn over right in the first quarter anything like that. We start Expo here in a couple days which is our large franchisee event every year. We've got good attendance this year which is good to see, but we still think some of the data points that we typically look at around predicting the business are starting to get a little bit better and will get better into the summer.","What we did see in the fourth was we saw some order growth which was good, we saw something strengthening with in terms of our franchisee headcount. So a lot of those forward-looking things are starting to get better. I wouldn't call them really good yet, but we have a little bit more optimism obviously the team is doing a great job executing as I mentioned in the prepared remarks in diagnostics and in places where they have opportunity. They've done a very good job and we think a lot of that effort plus a little bit better market we\u2019ll start to happen as we progress through the year.","I think they\u2019ll be in the growth mode probably this quarter, but I think that number will get better through the year.","Jeff Sprague","Then I just want to clarify on the acquisition related cost that you disclosed in your bridge, I think it was 11 million in the quarter. Those were running through your segment operating profit numbers as they reported right, more than just pick them out the bottom of the bridge is that correct?","Jim Lico","Yes that\u2019s correct.","Jeff Sprague","And then finally on tax Chuck I think 20% might be the lowest number I've seen except for the Irish domicile firms that I cover. Are you confident that\u2019s a long-term number, is there something shorter-term that - you burn off say in a year or two and you drift higher or can we think about that as a pretty solid long-term rate?","Chuck McLaughlin","We've spent a lot of time it\u2019s likely maybe we\u2019ll run more as there is more pronounces coming up. But we feel very good about the 20%. We don't think that's going to drift higher unless there some change in the code going forward and we're very pleased with the work our tech team has done and there's been some incremental spend to get there. But we\u2019re pretty happy with all the work and I think you can use that going forward.","Jeff Sprague","Indeed I'm jealous congrats good luck.","Chuck McLaughlin","Thank you.","Jim Lico","Thanks Jeff. And our hardest working tech team in Fortive in the last 30 days is probably been our tech team, so they do a great job.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","I too have a question similar to Jeff but maybe we'll take it offline if you want on the PI margin and how the transaction costs are being taken out. I'll just say it in brief maybe you can help me out if not after we can talk out offline.","The transaction costs have been taken out of the adjusted EPS yet here they are in this margin. Can you kind of walk-through and we shouldn\u2019t then essentially the adjusted margin be shown here as 120 basis points higher or am I misunderstanding?","Jim Lico","No, I think if we adjusted the margins for transaction costs out that's correct, but we just adjusted out one place on the EPS, but you\u2019re not wrong about that.","Scott Graham","The other question is the dilution from the acquisitions looks like a ton of that was due to the kick up in amortization. Where do we go from here on those acquisitions in terms of kicking out cost to eliminate that margin dilution. And on a go forward basis should we see this type of amortization kick up on future acquisitions?","Jim Lico","But I think what we try to focus on is the core segment margins which I had pointed to for just that kind of reason until we get to a year. But that's a multilayered question - I rather when we take it offline and we\u2019ll walk you through each one of those things, but that's the reason we try to focus on the core and give you that on the presentation.","Scott Graham","But this is something that did run through the margin on an adjusted basis this quarter, and I guess what I'm saying is on go forward basis, is this something that you're comfortable with this type of hit to margin?","Jim Lico","We think that it helps grow earnings per share and so yes we are.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","So maybe just touching on tech for a second the growth rates all year we\u2019re really impressive clearly the products and introductions are working. I guess maybe talk a little bit about the go forward around what you're doing from a product perspective. And then how you guys are thinking about this business from a longer-term growth rate perspective.","Jim Lico","So as you said they had a very strong year really a number of things that they have done exceptionally well from an execution standpoint. I think we highlighted last year we had a large order from a large mobile phone manufacturer in the first part of the year that helped and in the second half of the year we really did - a really strong, really great job with the new product introduction of the 5 Series that we talked about in the prepared remarks.","That 5 Series is the first generation of a new platform of product that will continue to come out in a series of things over the next several years. So not only will the product itself have some runway in the next year, but the platform itself will also deliver some runway.","We've always said that tech is somewhere in the low single-digit grower over a long period of time and during when things are a little bit better they\u2019ll popup above that that\u2019s around a little bit better than market growth they tend to perform better than market growth. So that's how we think about it and what we\u2019ve been trying to do with the business is continue to build less cyclicality out of it with extending our service business which is a pretty substitute part of Tektronix now.","So those are things we\u2019re doing long-term to not only solidify the growth rate but also make it less cyclical and the number of our actions have been working and you saw that cloud in 2017 and you\u2019ll see that cloud in 2018.","Joe Ritchie","And maybe my follow on here just touching base, you had some pretty positive comments on IFC, I think I heard growing double digits. Just can you give us a little bit more of an update on Landauer I think you said integration was going well but just curious to see how that that business is growing?","Jim Lico","So we had just maybe a little bit we were with the ISC team last week, we\u2019re really impressed with the work that they've done to take the Fortive business system and really do a lot with it. They were already had a pretty strong continuous improvement culture and have really done a great job with it. Landauer a little bit later into the process because obviously we closed and then after the IFC deal, we\u2019ll see them in about a month and have an opportunity to see their progress.","We did a short review with the team here last week and really, really happy with the progress they have made on a number of action that they need to get after. I mentioned in the prepared remarks about we\u2019re using their channel now. We've rebranded the entirety of the portfolio Fluke health solutions. And we've been seeing some real good synergy on the revenue side. So we feel good early days - it's still very early days but it\u2019s good to be in a good place in the early days then in alternative to that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair.","Brian Drab","So I was just - as I'm listening here and thinking about the comments that you made on the 5 billion. Are you - I was looking back at the notes that I have the most recent comments that you made were 5 billion to 7 billion through 2021 I think. And I'm just wondering if you\u2019re warming us up to the idea of - larger acquisitions coming sooner versus more of a bolt-ons with the potential for a large one. There is obviously a lot of M&A activity expected post clarity on the tax policy so that just what I'm thinking, are you warming us up to the idea of maybe a larger acquisition here in the near-term?","Jim Lico","Well Brian I think we've always tried to clear about two things. One is that we would look for strategic opportunities to accelerate our businesses. And two we try to give you sense of what our spending capacity could be at a point in time. Sometimes we give you a longer cycle that, I think what we'll try to do this time is to be really transparent about the opportunities we have in front of us.","I'm not trying to telegraph anything. The funnel we have today is very good, the breadth of the funnel and the strength of the funnel meaning good businesses, the breadth of the funnel meaning across platforms and geographies.","So we feel good that there's opportunity to deploy that. We never know how to predict those things, but we feel good about it and we didn't want it - we're really not trying to warm anybody up but rather just be very transparent and give you real sense of what kind of opportunities we could take advantage of should they avail themselves to us.","Brian Drab","And I just have one follow up and by one I don\u2019t mean four, is there anything in the pipeline that is larger than say 2 billion or 3 billion?","Jim Lico","Well I think it\u2019s hard to call anything - there are lot of things in the pipeline from a variety of sizes even some things we probably couldn\u2019t do today but would love to do down the road. So I think that\u2019s the way we think about it and that\u2019s why the breadth of the things are the things we could do today and things we can do tomorrow.","I think our success has always been about making sure that we don't just have an eye on the thing - on the next bank book to drop but rather have a real strategic vision of what we can do and cultivate the funnel that way. And so there is a great breadth of opportunity for us and hopefully with the work we do we\u2019ll make some of those reality over time.","Operator","And at this time, I\u2019m showing that we have no further questions. Presenters, I turn it back to you.","Jim Lico","Thanks everybody. As I said in the prepared remarks, we're really proud of the year we had. We really wanted to thank our employees around the world but we also want to thank all of you who spent the time with us, who really allowed us to give you a sense of our vision for the company and for the strength of the feedback you've given us.","We\u2019re incredibly proud of 2017, but even more excited about 2018. So we'll look forward seeing you all soon in a number of conferences and things like that. Lisa and the team are around for questions and follow-up and we\u2019ll see you real soon.

This strong performance reflects the vitality of our portfolio and the momentum created from our acquisition flywheel and with our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet, we are well-positioned to continue deploying capital towards M&A.","We are significantly advancing our portfolio enhancement work to accelerate growth and reduce cyclicality. Since last quarter we announced two acquisitions, the Advanced Sterilization Products business from Johnson & Johnson for $2.7 billion and Gordian for $775 million. Both acquisitions provide a meaningful entry into quality markets. ASP is clearly aligned with Fortive's strategy to help customers drive better safety compliance and productivity, and Gordian exemplifies our focus on investing in software enabled workflows.","We also issued 5% mandatory convertible preferred stock with net proceeds from the sale of the shares of $1.34 billion. With substantial M&A capacity our funnel remains strong with a range of targeted sizes to address strategic growth priorities.","Before I provide quarterly results, I'd like to share that we published our first CSR or corporate social responsibility report in June. I'm excited about the path we've chosen and the progress we have made on the issues that matter most to our employees, customers, communities and investors. While I'm proud of the direction we have established I'm aware that our work is evolving and so we welcome your feedback to inform our CSR related strategies and goals in the coming years.","With that I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings of $321.7 million were up 28.7% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.91 based on an adjusted effective tax rate of 17.7% for the quarter.","Sales grew 13.9% to $1.9 billion reflecting a core revenue increase of 5.3% as all of our six platforms posted core growth and four out of our six platforms grew mid single-digits or better. The continued success of acquisitions contributed 700 basis points of top line growth.","We're excited to review with you today several examples of how FBS growth tools and industry leading innovation are continuing to drive top line performance. Geographically high-growth markets core revenue grew mid single-digits with continued strength in Asia and Latin America.","Low double-digit growth in China was led by Gilbarco Veeder Root Sensing Technologies and Automation & Specialty businesses. Developed markets core revenue grew mid single-digits reflecting continued strength in North America.","Core revenue growth in North America was mid single-digits and was driven by strong performances at Tektronix Gilbarco Veeder Root Fluke and Jacobs Vehicle Systems. We delivered a third consecutive quarter of gross margins at or above 50%.","In the second quarter, we posted a strong gross margin of 50.6% reflecting 120 basis points of expansion over the prior year. Five of our six platforms delivered positive price for a net contribution of 50 basis points.","Operating profit margin was 20.6% with core operating margin expansion of 50 basis points driven by Professional Instrumentation favorable incrementals. During the second quarter we generated $315 million of free cash flow and a conversion ratio of 107%. For the full year we are tracking well to deliver our expected free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 110%.","Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 17.1% including core revenue growth of 3.4%. Acquisitions contributed 11.9% and favorable currency 1.8%. Reported operating margin of 24.7% reflected core margin expansion of 180 basis points as FBS drove strong price, innovation and supply chain benefits.","Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue increased low single-digits during the quarter driven by market outperformance at Fluke. Field Solutions core revenue grew mid single-digits in the quarter reflecting mid single-digit growth in both developed and high growth markets.","Fluke delivered high single-digit core growth led by double digit growth at Fluke Digital Systems Fluke Networks and our thermal imaging business within Fluke Industrial. At eMaint net new customer growth was 15% and recurring revenue grew greater than 25%.","The combination of hardware and software coupled with the safety and productivity value proposition offered by Fluke products continues to resonate with customers and drive market share gains. Increased growth investments in sales and marketing are clearly paying off as Fluke further outperforms its markets reflected by accelerated point of sale growth.","Industrial Scientific Corporation delivered mid teens revenue growth led by double digit growth in the INET and rental businesses. For those of you that attended our recent Investor Day last month at ISC you were able to see firsthand the strength of the ISC team and their enthusiasm for adopting the Fortive Business System to drive revenue growth and margin expansion while advancing ISC's digital strategy and continuous improvement culture.","Qualitrol core sales declined low double digit as high-single digit growth in North America was more than offset by declines in China, Europe and the Middle East. The market softness is consistent with what we messaged last quarter and we are actively working to improve what we expect to be declining sales for the remainder of the year.","Product Realization platform core revenues grew slightly for the quarter led by low single digit growth at Tektronix. Excluding the large 3D sensing win we highlighted in the second quarter 2017 Tektronix core revenue growth was high-single digits. Results were driven by double digit growth in developed markets and in industrial and automotive end markets reflecting the success of multiple new product introductions and our target market strategy.","I'm excited to announce that Tek launched its 6 Series Mixed Signal Oscilloscope last week. Based on the same breakthrough platform as the popular 5 Series MSO the 6 Series MSO is an industry first for this class of oscilloscope and provides higher performance up to eight gigahertz to target the substantial growth in applications that handle a vast amount of data.","It also measures devices at the lowest noise level of any product in the market, a critical feature for power devices, IoT and connected car applications and leverages the ease of use and software of the 5 Series.","With the 6 Series MSO we're delivering a compelling combination of best-in-class performance and usability that will boost productivity and shorten time to market for our customers. Our sensing technologies platform delivered mid single digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by double digit growth in China. New product introductions continue to deliver market share gains across the platform and our digital strategy is fueling progress towards launching additional IoT offerings.","One of the most recent examples of this is Acumen [ph] Inventory Management. This technology enables customers to manage inventory remotely through a centralized and\/or mobile user interface. By using a variety of sensing technologies Acumen can continuously measure solid material and help customers manage inventory and rate of consumption trends in a number of applications.","Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenue grew 11.2% including core revenue growth of 6.9%. Acquisitions contributed 280 basis points of growth and currency 150 basis points. Reported operating margin of 20.8% including core operating margin expansion of 30 basis points offset by 40 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions.","Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew high single digits led by strong double-digit growth in high growth markets. Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered high-single digit core revenue growth reflecting a strong rebound in North America driven by backlog reduction and increased demand for EMV solutions.","Strong double digit core growth in China was led by continued demand at Veeder-Root for submersible pumps and automatic tank gauges related to double wall tank upgrades.","We are pleased with the success of our previously announced exclusive programs with Chevron, Texaco and Valero retailers to drive EMV compliance as sales across these programs are up double-digits.","Additionally, we are seeing a strong pick up in EMV sales with mid-tier accounts and single site owners. These improved bookings along with key business wins continue to give us confidence in our expectation for GVR to grow core revenue mid single digits for the remainder of the year.","TeletracNavman delivered mid-single digit core growth led by double-digit sales growth in Asia Pacific and high-single digit SaaS sales growth. As we noted last quarter, the industry was challenged with integration and support issues associated with the electronic logging device mandate. We now see these issues beginning to stabilize and expect moderated growth rates for the balance of the year in the U.S.","Automation & Specialty posted another quarter of low double-digit core revenue growth led by high-teens growth in Asia. JVS delivered mid-teens core revenue growth, driven by increased Class A truck production in the U.S. and market share gains in China.","Growth in our automation businesses was led by Kollmorgen where low double-digit core revenue growth reflected continued robotic strength in Europe and China. The strong performance was also driven by automations focused on target verticals including medical and food and beverage end markets as well as new product innovations.","Kollmorgen introduced barcode navigation technology for mobile robotics application in smart warehouses and Portescap launched additions to the Ultra 22ECT Motor platform to provide higher torque capacity in the smallest footprint allowing further miniaturization of customer applications including industrial and surgical power tools. A&S business combination with Altra, as previously announced in March, is advancing nicely and we expect to close in the fourth quarter.","Moving to Franchise Distribution. The platform grew core revenue low single-digits. Matco core revenue grew low single-digits reflecting double digit growth in diagnostics software subscription sales and high single-digit growth in specialty tools driven by new product launches and market share gains. We believe market fundamentals are healthy, given a variety of metrics, including positive sell-in to sell-out ratio and a strong franchisee applicant funnel.","To wrap up, our team executed well during the second quarter, driving double digit sales and adjusted earnings per share growth, 50 basis points of core operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow performance.","As we look to the second half of the year, we expect our core growth rate to accelerate versus the first half, driven by improving order trends and as the acquisitions of Orpak, ISC and Landauer become part of our core revenue. The power of the Fortive Business System the vitality of our portfolio and the momentum created from our acquisition flywheel position us well for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.","Turning to the guide. We are updating our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.42 to $3.50, which includes improved assumptions of 4% to 5% core revenue growth, core margin \u2013 core operating margin expansion of approximately 75 basis points, an effective tax rate of 18% and free cash flow conversion of 110% for the year.","The updated adjusted diluted net EPS guidance also reflects the dilutive impact from the mandatory convertible preferred stock offering which we expect to offset with operational improvements. We are also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.83 to $0.87, which includes assumptions of mid single digit core revenue growth, core operating margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points and an effective tax rate of 18%.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Lisa. ","Lisa Curran","Thanks Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Philip, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Steve Winoker of UBS.","Steve Winoker","I wanted to just dive into some of the moving parts. First, Jim, on tariffs the $0.06 headwind that you called out, can you may be give us a sense of what's baked into that? You said it\u2019s enacted. Is it the cost structure? Do you have any pricing? Also that 50 basis points, is any of that pulling through there yet? Is there any demand impact in that?","Jim Lico","First I'll take the demand question. We don't think there's a demand impact on the tariffs side. So that one's fairly - I think - obviously we raised the core growth for the second half, so we feel good about the revenue profile.","Relative to the cost infrastructure and some of the things that are going on Steve, first and foremost, I think the 232 stuff that we have pretty good clarity of has been fully counter-measured. It's ratable across most of the businesses and our team's done a nice job at offsetting it.","On the 301 things, where it's really been a mix of cost pricing first, so establishing more price in the businesses. Second is supply chain strategies. As you can imagine a number of things we can do to offset that and then some manufacturing changes in strategy. We have some situations where we can - we have choices of where we produce product and so we're making some of those decisions as well.","So that's only the sum total. It probably - it's really kind of a - probably number one is on the price side.","Steve Winoker","And then the second thing is, we're seeing all these prior M&A flywheel starting - acquisitions now starting to move to core growth and core operating margin expansion. And you mentioned that it was going to help in terms of core growth acceleration. And on my simple math on the operating margin as I go out to Q4 given 30 or 50 in Q3 and 50 and 2 and 100 in Q1, I think it's around 110 or so or 100, 110 in Q4. Can you maybe talk about some of those dynamics? Is most of this now starting to come from the new acquisitions as well or that are anniversaring?","Jim Lico","Yes it's still a smaller percent. Our guide is mostly I would say in terms of increasing the guide and the strength in the second half is still coming from the core business. Obviously core Tek, Landauer and ISC all fall into different order there. And I didn't even do the order right. It's really Orpak ISC Landauer I think.","But we think about 20 basis points in the second half growth rate is probably with those deals. So they're growing well and as we - they're still a small part of the portfolio but they're all doing exceptionally well and will start to add to the core growth rate here as we go forward.","Steve Winoker","And the OMX contribution from those, is it similar also in the fourth quarter as part of that 100 plus?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well I think it's not different than what we had been assuming. And I think that it's - yes there's a little bit of tailwinds from the acquisitions. But as Jim said, they're not the biggest piece. But us raising our guide is really about our business strengthening because the - as well as these acquisitions are performing they're really in line with what we've been seeing all year long.","Steve Winoker","And if I could just sneak one more in at Qualitrol, is that decline still all just end market based on condition launching for the utility side? Or is there something else going on there?","Jim Lico","We definitely think its market. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the North American business is very good. Where it's really been - it's mostly focused in China and in the Middle East. Now some of the Middle East business gets transacted through Europe so we called out as Europe, Middle East and China, but it's really the European slowdown is really with OEMs we're servicing the Middle Eastern economy.","So we definitely - it's a longer cycle business so the short cycle part of the business is doing okay. It's the project based business that's longer cycle. And that's why we have while we're doing a lot to change the direction of the business the team's doing a good job to protect margins. But we think it's probably slow the rest of the year and slightly into the first quarter probably until we start to see things pop up.","The good thing is the Field Solutions is doing so well. As we mentioned Fluke's doing very well, ISC is doing very well. So it's - the platform itself is in a good place right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research.","Scott Davis","You announced a couple interesting deals here. You did the J&J deal in June and then Gordian in July and financed with the convert. But is there a point where you have to slow down the M&A pace a little bit just more than anything else not because of financing on limitations. That's seems to be less of an issue now, but people issues. You don't have a huge corporate office. You have to integrate systems, and all kinds of back office stuff that I assume takes a fair amount of time.","And then I would imagine you plant a fair amount of your own people in those organizations some juncture to help drive culture too. So are there some challenges that just require you to slow down the pace of it in that regard?","Jim Lico","I think, yes. So I think number one is, the good thing about it is that we normally resource the integrations and the ability to sort of bring the acquisitions along with the platforms they're in. And so in the case of both of these we've got separate platform leaders who are leading those integrations. So we feel good.","We're always building capacity for the deals from a talent perspective. So number one first and foremost, when we talk about FBS we always talk about growth lean and leadership. And the leadership aspect of that is really about building the talent funnel to be able to take on these sorts of opportunities.","So first and foremost, we've got the FBS capability. Barb in person and their teams are ready to go and assist those management teams. We're getting really good management teams in both the case of ASP and Gordian. So we think they're excited to be a part of Fortive.","So I think we got a deserving organization that is doing a good job, they'll take FBS, our platform leaders. We'll obviously have to fill some jobs there for sure more on the ASP side than on the Gordian side because Johnson will be obviously it's a carve out so that will require some more talent.","But we feel very good about where we're at relative to that. And quite frankly, feel like we got more capacity to do. We -- in fact we'll review our leadership with our board here shortly. Our leadership funnel and our message to our board is going to be we've got great capacity to continue to do things for the right kind of transactions that will continue to build the portfolio.","So we're not just going to do deals to do deals, but to the extent that we can continue to build great businesses in, we've got the capacity to take it on. ","Scott Davis","And now that you just brought up Art's job, which is only one of hers and there\u2019s a lots of these companies you're buying so. How long does it take to teach someone FBS? I mean, how long do you -- how long does it take to get to some sort of level where you're acceptable that they're a fully functioning part of the Fortive culture as opposed to whatever culture they you were buying?","Jim Lico","Well, 22 years and I'm still learning, so I'm still trying to figure it out. But I think at the end of the day it - that the point at around, it takes a couple of years for the business to sort of - our sort of plan will be to sit down with the business leadership. We'll do our 100 day strategic plan. That will define kind of where the big opportunities are or maybe the gaps are in performance that we want to improve.","And then from there that sort of leads us to what are the FBS tools that you want to use. And we really use the successes of those tools to build the culture. And as the organization sees those wins, ultimately the adoption rate becomes pretty fast. You saw that at ISC with our - at Investor Day. We're one year in and the leadership team is really using the tools, understands the culture. And while they would admit I think that they've got a lot to learn they're certainly very proficient.","So in a year they can make good progress. In a couple of years they'll make substantive progress and obviously we'll be with them for that whole journey.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","So on China what's going on there? Maybe talk about what you're seeing and how this plays out in the second half. I know you guys have a bit of electronics exposure there, but it's different than perhaps some of the foreign players that sell into kind of directly into smartphones. Just curious as to what you guys are seeing in China as a start. ","Jim Lico","Yes. So we - at the beginning of the year we said we thought China was low to high single-digit. We obviously just said that we'd be low double-digits in the second quarter. So we're a little ahead of where we thought we would be. So that's good.","I would say we're seeing as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we're not only seeing obviously the Gilbarco Veeder-Root business, but we're seeing even sell through in a short cycle business like Fluke we're seeing mid single-digit sellout at our distributor level in the quarter. So we're still seeing pretty good growth. We feel good about China for the remainder of the year.","We're obviously watching for things. We read the headlines and obviously trying to understand to the extent that there's things that might change that. But in real discussions with real customers they continue to have demand. And in Tek's performance if you take out the onetime 3D sensing situation there that we mentioned from a year ago it actually had a pretty good quarter in China. So relatively broadbased.","So I think we're still seeing good growth there. And as I said we always anticipated it would moderate a little bit from the really strong performance we've had the last two years and we've sort of been a little bit above that. So I feel pretty good about it of where we are right now.","Steve Tusa","Where do you expect China to grow in the second half?","Jim Lico","We'll be somewhere - I think we'll be somewhere in the -- between low double digit and high single probably is where we'll end up. Somewhere -- so not a lot of moderation.","Steve Tusa","And then when you think about kind of all the moves that you guys had done the preferred ANS. ASP. Gordian I don't know what other anagrams I'm missing here. But when you think kind of all the things you've done over the last call it four to five months if you will, what is all kind of -- what do you think is kind of all the net accretion for next year from all this stuff?","Chuck McLaughlin","Steve this is Chuck. So the way I think about that before we put FBS to work and drive business just the net of all these moving parts is slightly accretive into next year maybe less than $0.05. And then on top of that, you're going to see us do a normal earnings growth type of running FBS, our volume and OMX growth on top of that, and then whatever happens in the second half.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just a first question around the core margin expansion at industrial tech, there wasn't much in Q1 because of a tough comp on the margin. Q2, I guess the core margin growth wasn't that substantial either. So, just wondered if you could give a bit more color as to why that's the case and how you see that core OMX playing out in industrial tech in the second half.","Jim Lico","Julian, it's Jim. We obviously have had good growth in the quarter and we had pretty good incrementals on that. We had a couple of situations given the strength of the business we've had. We have a couple of one-time things at Gilbarco relative to a customer in India and some -- we mentioned some of the churn situations in OMX, and so we had a couple of one-time things there that if we sort of looked through those, we see almost 100 basis points of margin expansion so in the segment.","And so we see -- we have a good line of sight to -- in that 50 to 75 basis points kind of margin expansion. We have pretty good line of sight to the second half being in that zone.","Julian Mitchell","And my second question just around the Product Realization sales softness. What do you see as the growth rate, the core growth rate for that business in the second half? And any big sort of moving parts in terms of regional mix, if you focus specifically on consumer electronics and also the energetic materials business that you called out?","Chuck McLaughlin","So Julian this is Chuck. As Jim mentioned, we had the 3D sensing order last year. But if we take that out, what that would indicate for the second half is mid-single-digit growth for them, and that's what we expect. That's I think where they're going to end up at the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Maybe start with Chuck. Just on the convert, we don't see a lot of this structure at least in our sector. But what's unique about Fortive's capital structure and financing needs in the situation that a convert made sense?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well, a great question. I think that given our appetite for M&A and our desire to keep a strong balance sheet, and the attractive rates that we looked around and looked at all the things that were available to us. We really felt like this was a great time to go with the convert. And also, as we talked about -- we've got this ultra field where we're going to end up retiring shares. And to actually get the value out of the separation we needed to replace those shares and while -- and this gets pretty close to doing that.","Deane Dray","And then, optically there are times where the buyers of these converts will short the common just as a way of hedging, and I haven't seen the latest update in short interest. But are you expecting to see this and people just have to understand it's related to hedging not a bet against the stock?","Chuck McLaughlin","I think, we don't expect that to be a big number. I mean, we didn't \u2013 it's not that big of a relative to our market cap that I expect that's going to be a big thing. But there'll be a little bit of that for sure.","Deane Dray","What's the share's assumption and the dilution?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well, I think, the dilution is about $0.04 a quarter. And the shares is somewhere around 14 million to 18 million, depending on what the stock price does. If stock price goes up the dilution comes down.","Deane Dray","And then just as a follow up, Jim, in the prepared remarks, five out of six businesses got price. Just the ranking of the pricing power on the portfolio today. And if push comes to shove and there's going to be more pricing \u2013 price increases, what room do you have?","Jim Lico","Well, I think, we've had \u2013 as you know, we have good pricing power in most of the portfolio. Where we saw \u2013 where we historically have seen good price is probably been in \u2013 more in Professional Instrumentation we tend to sell and the go-to-market there is not as much OEM, so it's a little easier to get price.","The 301 stuff hits Professional Instrumentation a little bit more than it does industrial tech. So the idea of tariffs and some of those kinds of things line up well with where we typically get price. So we feel good about the countermeasures we got in place Deane.","There's a little bit of the effect where we'll get all of it in the fourth quarter. We'll get a little bit of \u2013 some of the \u2013 we don't have complete coverage in the third as some of the pricing actions take place. But we feel really good about our ability to countermeasure what we have, what we've seen thus far and if other things were to come out there, we feel good about our ability to countermeasure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","So just from the - just, I think on the tariff here. So I mean, I've done some basic divestments around this and so hovering right here. But it looks like about $500 million of - approach to this subject has - would be like an analyzed number. Is that about right Chuck? I mean, is my math correct there?","Chuck McLaughlin","Did you say $500 million? ","Nigel Coe","Yes.","Chuck McLaughlin","For the tariffs? Is that...","Nigel Coe","No. About the growth purchases subject to tax. I mean just the $50 million of tax rate divided by share count is about $0.12. So that's how I did the math. I mean, would that be right?","Chuck McLaughlin","I think that's \u2013 no, I think that's overweight quite a bit. We can get you - I think it's - for us we're seeing about $0.03 a quarter of gross headwind. And that's for our business.","Nigel Coe","Maybe just a bit more color in terms of, I mean, Jim you alluded to the fact that some of the businesses impacted by the tariffs are where you think got better pricing power so there's almost like a hedge there. But maybe just talk about which businesses are most impacted. Any color in terms of what you're sourcing and producing in China, you bring into the U.S. would be helpful. And then in terms of the 3Q guidance, it looks like you're assuming $0.02 to $0.03 impact to offsets in 4Q. Is that sort of the right lay-up?","Jim Lico","Well, we are protecting this a little bit. So we think about the two sets of tariffs the, 232 stuff is sort of ratable across, as I mentioned. Everybody buys a little bit of steel. A little bit more like in toolbox, obviously, versus something. But, by and large, that number is a little smaller and more ratable across. But it's a smaller number.","301 is much more focused on electronics, so you can imagine where we have electronics content. And where we tend to be more global so places like -- for example are going to be where we might see more of the tariffs.","The good news there is we have global supply chain. We have global manufacturing capability. So our ability to countermeasure with some of those kinds of activities is actually greater as well and those are the actions we're taking.","And I think just to follow-on is we expect to be able to countermeasure the impact of the tariffs in the year. There might be a slight impact in Q3 for us just -- but we'll get it all out through the year.","Nigel Coe","And then just a following question. Obviously lots of moving parts on - this quarter you said - growth in second half of the year. Some of the forecast for next year - calling for semiconductor CapEx to be down next year in 2019, do you think you can still grow in that kind of mid-single digit zone if semiconductor CapEx is down next year?","Jim Lico","I think - well yes and I think one, we're going to have mid-single digit number as against really, really strong comps in the second half last year. So that very good performance. We continue to see opportunities.","It's probably still a little too early to tell how much the CapEx overall number will necessarily impact as our overall business. As you know Nigel, Tek is mostly in the -- almost exclusively in the R&D side of things and not around manufacturing CapEx.","And as the manufacturing CapEx is really the big swing in that number. So some of the -- have nothing to do with whether or not Tek sells -- in many cases. So we continue to have conversations with customers.","The six Series also the scope that we just announced is in a number of applications that we think will have tremendous opportunity next year. Automotive which is principally autonomous vehicles data centers low noise, low signal, low power applications and IoT.","So I don't think those applications are necessarily going to be things that are less next year. So we've re-pivoted the business towards a number of those kinds of applications. So it's a little early to predict what 2019 will look like but we still think there's plenty of opportunity in 2019.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sawyer Rice of Morgan Stanley.","Sawyer Rice","Maybe just a two part here on DVR. Any sense of what the mix between -- kits was in the quarter and maybe the impact there on margin as a result? And then just kind of looking forward are you guys expecting this business to start to ramp into the back half and into next year as we start to approach the MP deadline here in the U.S.?","Jim Lico","Well I think minimal margin impact on kits versus dispensers. We'll follow-up with you what the exact number is. But I think it was sort of the way we came in. When you look at the mix of business it was a good mix of business as we said.","The exclusive partnerships that we've got with people like Valero was up double digits as we said in the prepared remarks. I think what we really like was the single retailer what we call the single network owner.","That business coming back it's a pretty good margin business as well. So I think all of the trends for the second half -- all the trends we saw in the quarter would suggest that the second half is pretty good. Is that helpful?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Can you give us a little more color on Gordian? Cyclically resistant, but obviously the underlying end market is building construction. We know it's high in recurring revenue and software, software it seems like underlying end markets would be cyclical though. So can you talk about the historical performance, especially during slowdown? And is there anything else that gives you confidence of the business is really cyclically resilient?","Jim Lico","Yes. So the business primarily - the core customer here is the public sector asset owner. So think of the VP facility at a public university and some contractors and architects as well. So that's first and foremost kind of who they sell into. State and local government, healthcare, universities are the principal customers.","These are not for big CapEx projects. They're mostly used whether it's job order contracting or RS means or even sidelined, they're mostly used \u2013 they're mostly used for things like small projects that tend to not have \u2013 still be done in times of slowdowns and things like that.","So I think that's first and foremost. I think we the business performed pretty well 08, 09 so we think it'll be fine In the sort of end market capital project it's nearly not tied to commercial real estate in the sense of new \u2013 so much in commercial real estate tends to be in things that are big building related. This is much more tied to the maintenance of buildings which tends to be pretty stable. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","And then can you give us a little bit more color on Franchise Distribution and Matco in particular? You mentioned a little better growth here in Q2 and high single-digit growth in your tools business. So have you turned the corner here and now you have a better visibility to growth moving forward? ","Jim Lico","Yes. So we were - I think versus the market they outperformed, when we look at the growth rate. As we said in the prepared remarks, I think on a small base but the subscription revenue was up, which is good to see building more of a recurring revenue set.","And the health metrics were good. That's probably the thing we felt good about maybe a little bit more optimism here is that the heath metrics we're seeing more the franchisee applicant funnel, which is a good predictor of business down the road is getting - is becoming more full. So those are good things. We have still not seen the toolbox business come back. So I think we've \u2013 I would say I would call Matco right now stable.","And I wouldn't necessarily suggest we've seen an inflection point yet. But I think we're in growth mode and we're in a stable growth mode. And so we'll continue to watch the metrics to see when that sort of moves the growth rate up, but I think right now I would say stability is really the right word to describe it the business.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Chuck just a quick one for you. Our tax rate keeps stretching down, which you have to commend your team on. But I guess at some point there's a low point to where it could go. 18% is pretty low already. So do you have more room there or is that kind of what we should expect going forward?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well I think - take the second question. I think 18% is a good number for \u2013 at this point in time and I'd probably use that into next year as well. How well can it go? It really just depends on how the world keeps changing. There's tax reform that happens outside the U.S. And then as we come to learn the correct interpretations of the U.S. Tax Reform it creates opportunities. And when you put all that together with our M&A -- I don't know how much or goes. It depends on what the is but it -- right now 18% is a good number. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Wondering if we could just circle back to the guidance one more time. I guess, slide 8 would seem to suggest you're bluffing the top end of the range. I don't know if that's correct or not. But I guess whether that is correct or not what needs to happen to get you to the upper end that kind of - half of that is speared, I think of maybe one of the first questions that the implicit operating margins in the fourth quarter do need to step up very nicely. So is there something in cost structure or mix or something that you have visibility on that makes that fourth quarter come together? ","Jim Lico","No, I think that there's a little bit of some investments that we made in the fourth quarter of last year that makes probably the margin expansion a little better. But there's not a step function in terms of the VCMs that we would expect to see from Q3 to Q4 to make that - getting to the high end.","Although I would emphasize that we do have a range and even though in a rising market to the high end it's not -- we just wanted to give that the way we give that reconciliation out there at the high end was meant so you could see the moving pieces really clearly. ","Jeff Sprague","And then a quick modeling question. Corporate was a little bit higher than I was expecting. Is there some business development going on there or what and what should we expect for the year?","Chuck McLaughlin","I think that this is where we're seeing some of these deal related expenses show up for the Altra deal and the ASP deal are some are some -- and there's also some external spend around the tax deal. So that's what's mostly driving the step up in corporate. ","Jeff Sprague","Is that a run rate now this Q2 number or is that elevated? ","Chuck McLaughlin","I think it's going to be elevated from here in Q3 and in Q4. But then coming into next year it'll drop back down into the low 20s.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Baird.","Richard Eastman","Thanks Jim. And Chuck and Lisa for the question. Jim just a question around reckoning out a little bit Fluke Health Solutions -- with Landauer now coming into core later this year. You got Fluke Biomedical, J&J, ASP deal gets done. I mean, I think, we can calculate this out at over $1 billion in revenue on the health solutions side.","What's the strategy for those three businesses? Do they ultimately get -- is that the makings of kind of a new platform here? How will you kind of integrate those and manage them? Or will they kind of stay separate businesses? ","Jim Lico","Yes, I think what we will do here not to push the question off a little bit but what we're trying to do -- what we will do with Altra and with Altra going out and our automation business going to Altra and with our work in health with ASP will ultimately come back to everybody with how this is all going to look from a platform perspective. It's suffice to say that there are opportunities for synergies with some of the businesses.","You're right in your numbers we will have over $1 billion worth of health care between the businesses Fluke Biomedical, Landauer and with ASP. So that's obviously a meaningful amount of revenue with good growth and great margin expansion opportunities.","We're thinking through a variety of things that will make sense on a couple of different angles. So more to come on that, but I think the idea that we're building this capability around safety, productivity and quality assurance in medical applications is been the reigning strategy for all of those additions to the portfolio.","So what we do is really I think exciting to be able to offer these sorts of solutions to customers. So there are synergies between the two. We don't always have to structure things differently in order to get after those synergies. That's always been the culture of us. So we'll determine if they're appropriate. We are in the process of determining the appropriate organizational structure and more to come once we -- once we're landed on all of the puts and takes going on in the portfolio.","Richard Eastman","So it would seem that greater than $1 billion maybe $1.2 billion or something like that would have probably some of your best FBS opportunity? I would think with..","Jim Lico","Well definitely - for sure revenue is 12 months old right? Landauer, we just bought a year ago. ASP will come into the fold. So without a doubt just by nature of them just joining us -- joining the team they will have more opportunities to be able to take advantage of productivity safety quality all of the things that - and growth. I think as we said when we announced ASP deal we thought the innovation and growth tools will be a big help to the ASP business as well.","Richard Eastman","And then just a quick one for Chuck. What's the FBS for number that you're using for third quarter guide?","Chuck McLaughlin","I'm sorry. ","Richard Eastman","The fully diluted share count that you're calculating using third quarter guide.","Chuck McLaughlin","I got it right here.","Richard Eastman","Because that will capture the convert correct?","Chuck McLaughlin","Yes say 3.73.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","I have two questions, one on pricing, one on GVR. I was actually a little surprised that the pricing was only up 50 basis points. Will we see that higher in the second half of the year? Are there anything -- is there anything you netted against that? Because we're seeing little higher elsewhere?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well most of it is because when you think about some of the things related to tariffs and inflation it really hasn't impacted us until mid-July. So it's - the 232 stuff that a lot of other companies saw it early was a reason to go in and go into the marketplace with price. Because we had so little impact from 232, it's a little difficult to do from a marketplace.","So when you look at the 50 bips that we had in the second quarter that's kind of our typical pure strength of the portfolio, strength of market position kind of price. And then the second half we'll see that accelerate as a number of our countermeasures start to play out.","Scott Graham","And then along those same lines when we talk about inflation of the cost 232 less so 301 more so, when you say that you're throwing a lot of things under tariffs, but obviously there was inflation before the tariffs. And my sense here is that with the minimal impact on 232, you're essentially saying I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you're essentially saying that you weren't seeing a lot of inflation in front of the tariffs. That was just pure commodities inflation that we saw second half of last year for example?","Jim Lico","Yes we have - we get a lot of what we - purchase price variance PPD. We have a really high quality supply chain organization that's really does a fantastic job. So we've been pretty good at mitigating some of the kinds of things that have occurred over -- that we've already seen. We\u2019ve seen some stuff on fuel surcharges and stuff like that as oil prices went up.","But by and large those have been things that we just mitigate as normal course of action. So we've been very good and that's why we've been able to when you look at the gross margin expansion as an example that we've seen over the last several quarters it's been really strong despite you might say a little bit more of an inflationary environment in the quarters before that.","Scott Graham","My GVR question is you've given us some information here for I think the first time that this midtier shrank double digit and you called those sort of I think smaller I don't know how many stations per owner type thing. How much of the market for EMV is that? Let's say a potential $500 million yes?","Jim Lico","The single site owner is probably 70 plus percent of the stations. But at the 80:20 right so at 70% of the stations but only maybe 30% of the -- it's pretty close to 80:20. So it's -- they don't spend as much money as the big retailers. But they do convert. And so we've seen a lot of visibility from the larger retailers over time as they get ahead of this.","As I think we've said pretty consistently is that one of the reasons why the single site owners or the single network owners, a lot of them know their customers maybe they're in a smaller town or something like that. So they are the majority of the stations, but not necessarily majority of the dollars, but seeing them from on board.","Now the multi-site owners, the other part of that\u2019s kind of mid tier of the market and that\u2019s kind of a bit of a sweet spot in the market. And it's -- I don't have the exact numbers of percentages but, it's 30% probably the market in some way shape or form probably for dollar. So it's a good chunk of the market to start to see them doing their capital planning and starting to implement is a good sign for EMV.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Thanks for taking my questions here. I'm curious on Tek. How much - given the margin profile there like how sensitive would that would that segment be to movements there? Is that would that be one of the more like principal drivers on a given percentage move of margin in that business? Does that make sense?","Chuck McLaughlin","You mean across the whole company right?","Joe Giordano","Well I like ordering just PR. Like does have the biggest move on a given percentage change of revenue change in FBI?","Chuck McLaughlin","No, I think full price is the biggest piece of that on PI side. But Tek's got great margins and so when it goes up it does lift and it's great fall through well over 50%. So yes, it's impactful but it just really depends on the size of the impact.","Jim Lico","And as maybe just an add which is really good to see in the quarter Joe is even though Tek didn't have the growth rate that they had a year ago because of the comp this year they did an exceptional job on the gross margin side. And it really is on the back of their innovation.","We talked about the five Series being a very strong margin product. They've done an exceptional job of really bringing out these new products with more software and a better value proposition which is obviously even in a lower growth environment is allowing for them to really deliver better gross margins. ","Joe Giordano","And then on the tariff side I know you guys are pretty niche in your business so maybe this isn't really applicable. But are you seeing any like competitors non-U.S. competitors being like opportunistically competitive, is that having any impact in those specific businesses that you operate? ","Jim Lico","Not yet. Every business is different because kind of depends on where the competitors are. We're certainly looking to watch some of that. And quite frankly we're looking to do some of that as well. So we'll see where those opportunities are available to us but they'll be on a case by case basis.","I think the biggest thing it's really early right now. When you really think about most of these things really went live for sure just in the last few weeks it's pretty early to really tell if anything is - if there's a trend on anything yet. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Yes, thanks. Well, I missed a couple go quarter. So I'm catching up here. So just a quick clarification actually Chuck. You mentioned $0.05 net impact from M&A\/Altra. I think that's what you gave in your response to Steve's question. Would that include the dilution from converts or is that separate? ","Chuck McLaughlin","Yes. Actually what I was trying to say is all the things that we've done this year with Altra ASP the mandatory convert and you net all that stuff out what - where will it land with after share retirement and ASP closing.","So I think it's $0.05 accretive next year. And then on top of that will be our normal earnings growth that we get from the businesses and then whatever we do in the second half of the year. ","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue at this time. ","Jim Lico","Well Philip thank you and thanks everybody for taking the time this evening. We couldn't be more excited about the performance in the second quarter. We're really - as we turn - as we close out the first half of the year and start it in July we celebrated our second anniversary of being out. And we've gotten a lot done. We're really proud of the work we've done, the capital we've deployed, the ability to bring in great businesses, to take the opportunity to do the portfolio transformation.","Two years has gone exceptionally fast and those of you know us you know that we're never satisfied and the highest expectations that we have are those of ourselves. So we're really excited. We appreciate the time and energy you put into learning more about us. Thanks for a great start last two years. We look forward to telling you more about what's going on.

In the face of these headwinds, which negatively impacted core growth in our professional instrumentation segment, the Fortive team delivered high-teens total revenue growth, including continued outperformance at the Varco Bitterroot and another quarter of strong free cash flow conversion, driven by disciplined execution and the strength of the Fortive business system. ","Our strong earnings and cash flow performance reflected the momentum of our capital deployment strategy as acquisitions continue to enhance the growth profile and reduce the cyclicality of our portfolio. Importantly, the integration of advanced sterilization products has gotten off to a good start solid start as it delivered a greater than expected earnings contribution during our first quarter of ownership. We look forward to providing additional updates as integration progresses and we exit the majority of our transition services agreement with Johnson & Johnson through the first half of 2020. ","At the same time the earlier acquisitions of ISC and Landauer continue to deliver strong results, increasing the resilience of the portfolio as they generated high single-digit core growth and 360 basis points of core OMX on a combined basis. Gordian and Accruent also continue to perform well and will be additive to core growth in the Professional Instrumentation segment when they turn core during the third quarter.","Consistent with the broader, digital strategy that we highlighted during our May investor conference, we recently completed three additional acquisitions within field solutions. The acquisitions of intellect and safer systems as well as proof technique demonstrate our ability to continue to find high quality companies to accelerate our digital strategy, and bring connected workflow solutions to our customers.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn to the details of the quarter, adjusted net earnings were $322.3 million, up 19.2% over the prior year and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.90. Sales grew 16.4% to $1.9 billion, reflecting a core revenue increase of 2%. Core revenue growth was highlighted by strong performance in the Varco Bitterroot, EMC and industrial scientific, which is partially offset flat quarter from fluke and a decline in Tektronix. ","Acquisitions, including Gordian, Accruent and ASP contributed 1,650 basis points of top-line growth, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 210 basis points. Geographically high-growth markets core revenue decreased low-single digits due to weaker market conditions in Asia and Latin America. In India strong growth in fluke was more than offset by timing on some large orders at GVR that pushed into the second half of the year. We continue to expect strong growth in India for the full year.","China posted low-single digit growth with strong performances at ISC and sensing technologies, the more modest growth across Fluke, Tektronix and GVR. Developed markets core revenue grew low-single digits as strength in North America was partially offset by weakness in Western Europe. Core revenue growth in North America was mid-single digits, led by GVR, EMC and Industrial Scientific, while Western Europe decreased low-single digits with continued growth at GVR.","Reported operating margin was 13.4%, reflecting 540 basis points of dilution from acquisitions, and 180 basis points of dilution for deal related costs. Core operating margins increased 30 basis points as continued strong volume at GVR and the disciplined application of FBS help offset headwinds within professional instrumentation.","During the second quarter, we generated $236 million of free cash flow and a conversion ratio of 134%. While we anticipate a continuation of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we expect sustained strong free cash flow generation and conversion of greater than 125% for the full year. ","Turning to our segments, Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 27.5% on relatively flat core revenue. This growth performance reflected the continued transformation of Professional Instrumentation over the past few years, with acquisitions driving growth, contributing 2,930 basis points during the quarter. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 190 basis points. Reported operating margin of 10.8% reflected 1,220 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions and deal related costs, including purchase accounting adjustments, and transaction expenses from the initial closing of ASP.","Core operating margins decreased basis points, reflecting slower revenue performance, the impact of tariffs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue was flat as strong performance at EMC and Industrial Scientific was offset by the slowing in Fluke and Tektronix.","Field Solutions core revenue was flat with developed markets growing slightly paced by the continued strong performance of ISC. High growth markets decrease low-single digits as slightly positive growth is Fluke and a strong performance from ISC in China were more than offset by the expected weakness at Qualitrol. ","While not yet core we were very pleased with the continued performance of Accruent and Gordian. Accruent continues to see strong growth in North America across a variety of end markets, driven by demand for its lease management and space optimization offerings. Gordian\u2019s growth continues to be paced by its procurement platform, driven by increased construction volumes for new customers, including the Hawaii Department of Education and the City of Atlanta. ","Fluke\u2019s core revenue was flat, as low-single digit growth at Fluke industrial and calibration, and mid-single digit growth and Fluke Networks was offset by declines in tomography, process instruments and Health Solutions. Fluke Digital Systems grew 30% as eMaint generated high-single digit net new customer growth, and a greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue. Fluke generated low-single digit growth in China and we remain watchful for more potential slowing in that market through the second half.","As we highlighted at the investor conference in May Fluke recently launched a new Sonic Industrial Imager, a revolutionary product which enables maintenance teams to quickly and accurately locate air, gas and vacuum leaks, utilizing Fluke\u2019s state of the art sound site technology. Fluke also completed the bolt-on acquisition of Pruftechnik, a leader in vibration monitoring, alignment and testing equipment and services. The acquisition of Pruftechnik accelerates Fluke\u2019s asset, liability and condition monitoring strategy, which now accounts for greater than $200 million in total revenue, with a combination of industry leading measurement tools, and best in class domain expertise.","ISC delivered mid-single digit core revenue growth, this was led by North America and Asia Pacific, including strong performance in China, which more than offset some slowing in Western Europe. iNet registered another strong quarter with high-teens growth, while rental generated high-single digit growth against a tough compare from the prior year. ISC delivered 290 basis points of OMX in the quarter as strong mix and PPV execution through the application of the Fortive Business System continues to drive consistent operational improvement.","Industrial Scientific recently completed the acquisition of Intellects [ph], a leading provider of the HNF software, and safer systems, who's leading cloud based platform provides real time hazard analysis and risk assessment to the chemical, oil and gas and transportation sectors. These acquisitions significantly advanced ISC\u2019s safety as a service strategy to provide a comprehensive real time connection between its customers workforce and assets and the management of their environmental, health and safety related workflows.","Qualitrol\u2019s core revenue declined low-double digits in line with our expectations. Qualitrol continues to see early signs of a more stable conditions in certain markets, as it generated positive bookings growth for the first time in eight quarters.","While North America remains challenged due to lower retrofit project spending, the Middle East increased low-double digits, the first positive performance in the region in seven quarters, driven by the release of some previously delayed projects.","Product realization core revenue was flat as strong double-digit growth at EMC was offset by weakness in Tektronix. EMC generated broad based growth across its core aerospace and defense product lines, as well as its commercial satellite offering. A record backlog at the end of the quarter as EMC well positioned for continued growth, supported by the scaling up of key customer programs and market share gains.","Tektronix registered a mid-single digit decrease in core revenue, much of this weakness was driven by continued slowing at KEITHLEY. Weakness in Western Europe, and the negative impact associated with Huawei\u2019s inclusion on the U.S. restricted entity list in May. The slowing macro conditions in Western Europe led to a high-teens decrease and had a broad based impact across Tektronix\u2019s product lines.","We expect headwinds at KEITHLEY and in Western Europe to persist in the coming quarters, as will challenges from Huawei status, pending any resolution of ongoing trade hostilities between the U.S. and China. Tektronix\u2019s investments are driving growth mid-range scopes, as its new offerings continue to perform well growing high-single digits and marking 10 consecutive quarters of strong growth.","The successful launch of the new three and four series MSOs added to the continued success of the five and six series including several large deals with enterprise customers. Tektronix recently closed the previously announced transaction to contribute its video tasks and monitoring business to a new entity form with Telestream and Genstar Capital.","Core revenue for sensing technologies increased low-single digits, the platform saw solid growth across the medical and critical environment end markets, driven by new product introductions and continued share gains. However headwinds from semiconductor equipment customers continued and sensing also saw broader slowing across its core industrial end markets towards the end of the quarter.","China continue to perform well with greater than 20% growth, but was partially offset by weakness in North America and Western Europe. We're also seeing good early traction in Sensing\u2019s IoT offerings, including SBT\u2019s AccuBin platform for supply chain applications, and the oil condition monitoring system from Gems. ","Turning to Advanced Sterilization products, the company got off to a solid start in the second quarter and were pleased with how the integration is progressing. ASP grew low-single digits in line with our expectations led by strong performance in China. ASP also saw improved growth in Japan, led by strong performance in Terminal Sterilization, as well as growth in high level disinfection, supported by the successful introduction of the ENDOCLENS cleanse, Neo D are new automatic endoscope re-processor product for the Japanese market. ","North America was slightly positive and up sequentially from the first quarter, driven by Terminal Sterilization consumables. During the quarter, ASP saw several large orders from a range of new and existing integrated delivery network customers.","Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenue grew 2.6%, including core revenue growth of 4.4%, acquisitions contributed 50 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 230 basis points. Reported operating margin was 20.9% and core operating margin increased 210 basis points driven by continued strong volume at GVR and solid performance at Matco. ","Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew mid-single digits, led by high-single digit growth in North America. GVR delivered high single digit core revenue growth highlighted by a low-double digit increase in developed markets, strength in North America reflected the continuation of strong EMV related sales, while Western Europe reflected share gains and strong spending by BP's [indiscernible] subsidiary.","Gilbarco also completed outdoor EMV capable software releases of its passport point of sale system on the Citgo and Shell Networks. Passport is now available on more than 70% of Gilbarco\u2019s install base, well ahead of other point of sale competitors. In high growth markets GVR posted a mid-single digit decline compared to greater than 30% growth in the prior year period, as the timing of tenders in China and India shifted volume into the second half of the year.","GVR is up high-single digits year-to-date in high growth markets paced by momentum from Orpak\u2019s leading automation offering with strong orders and a healthy backlog that will support strong growth in the coming quarters. GVR also launched its new high growth markets dispenser platform Latitude, which has been very well received by customers thus far and is expected to drive additional growth going. ","In-line with expectations TeletracNavman's core revenue decrease low-double digits in the second quarter and strong growth across Asia Pacific was more than offset by a decline in North America and Western Europe. While North America remains a significant headwind, the TeletracNavman teams continued focus on stabilizing the businesses resulted in a reduction in customer churn.","We expect to see continued improvement in the coming quarters for bookings in ACV and on the backs of new product launches as well as better performance across large enterprise customers and the SMB sales channel. ","Moving to franchise distribution, the platforms core revenue increased low-single digits during the second quarter. As mid-single digit growth at Matco was partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in Hennessy. Matco outperforming in the quarter paced by strong growth in diagnostics and hardline tools.","High-teens growth in diagnostics was due in part two new additions to Matco's Maximus family of diagnostic products. The Maximus Flash Plus which provides OEM level live diagnostics expertise, and the Max Flex a full featured diagnostic tablet offered with a highly customizable monthly subscription plans.","Turning to the guide. We are updating our full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.45 to $3.60 representing year-over-year growth of 13% to 18% on a continuing operations basis. The revised annual guidance has been reduced to reflect the short cycle slowing trends that emerged during the second quarter, which we expect to impact demand through the second half of the year. ","The revised guidance assumes 2.5% to 3.5% core revenue growth and effective tax rate of 16.1% and free cash flow conversion of greater than 125% for the year. We are also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.83 to $0.88, representing year-over-year growth of 19% at the high-end. This includes assumption of 2% to 4% core revenue growth, 25 basis points of core OMX, and an effective tax rate of 16.1%.","To wrap up, we delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and strong free cash flow conversion, despite some slowing across the short cycle elements of our portfolio. Disciplined execution and the application of FBS delivered 30 basis points of core OMX in the face of both the anticipated challenges from tariffs and foreign exchange, and the lower than expected volume from Fluke and Tektronix during the quarter. The strong performance of our acquisition from the past few years continues to enhance the growth and resilience of the overall portfolio, positioning us well to deliver -- continue to deliver top quartile child earnings growth.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin.","Griffin Whitney","Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Jason, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good afternoon.","James Lico ","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe a first question just around some of the phasing of earnings in the second half. So just taking the midpoint of third quarter, midpoint of the full year guide. It looks like you have about a 25% EPS increase sequentially in Q4. So just wanted to check if that's roughly correct and what drives such a big up uplift? I understand last Q4, you had a big sequential increase, but there was a lot of pre-buy helping that?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes. I think there's a few things when you look at the way you will get. One is there's normal seasonality between Q3 and Q4, so you get more volume there. There's also the year-on-year core growth that we got between 2% and 4%. And then there's the year-on-year whiffed of Gordian and Accruent and ASP. And I think those two things -- those three things get you to the year-on-year whiffed. The way I look at it is, when I look at it from year-on-year last year, I think we were at $0.91 at the -- I think the high-end of our guide we're talking about around 15% high-teens to 18% increase in the fourth quarter.","Julian Mitchell","Understood, thank you. And then maybe just following up on the free cash flow. That was under some pressure in the second quarter, it look like the working capital for the half as a whole particularly on receivables was a bit of an outflow. So maybe talk through how quickly that free cash flow recovers.","Charles McLaughlin","Certainly, so the main thing that -- first of all most the businesses are performing very well and delivering a lot of cash flow, but the big outlier here is ASP that we just recently acquired as part of the deal acquired deal that we signed. And we got no receivables NAP, so there is going to be this one-time hole as we refill that -- those receivables that can put us behind on cash flow, but except for that one time thing that will be roughly done halfway through Q3. I think that we see our ongoing free cash flow, growing roughly in line with the growth we see in adjusted earnings. ","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Charles McLaughlin","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","And your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. ","James Lico ","Hi, Scott. ","Scott Davis","Just as a big picture observation looking at slide four and the SG&A deltas. Are there any structural reasons Jim and Chuck why the newer assets once they get fully on boarded, can have SG&A levels more traditional Fortive call 25% ballpark?","Charles McLaughlin","Scott its Charles, couple of things that one, the whiffed you are seeing year-on-year is primarily about the amortization that was added as well as the deal cost that\u2019s going on. So that's pretty close to 290 basis points. ","James Lico ","And I think relative to the businesses we\u2019re acquiring and I would look at the software businesses are having a little bit more SG&A that typically goes with a higher gross margins. And even in the G&A they tend to have a little bit more IT expense because we have IT expense related to some of the capability that you built to house the data and all those things.","So probably a little bit more estimated driven by a little bit more engineering, little bit more sales cost just because of direct selling, but the higher gross margin certainly pay for that. And if you're just purely look at G&A in some of the new businesses, particularly, the software businesses you tend to see a little bit more G&A because of a little bit more IT expense. But I think in general when you look at in ASP where businesses that look a little bit more like the business we have today, you see no reason why over time they would have a similar cost structure to what we've been able to achieve in other businesses.","Scott Davis","Okay, I think that answers it. And then, just trying to get a sense channel visibility, do you have particularly. I guess when you think what about ISC and Landauer I guess to a lesser extent ASP, do you have a good sense of any given time where inventory levels are versus the sell through?","James Lico ","We have decent visibility on ASP, so as we get the business more in line, we get off of some of these transition service agreements. We will have a better ability to see into those channels with some of the key channel partners. In the neighborhood of how we see things in other parts of the portfolio. Some of the others, ISC we\u2019re starting to achieve that as we continue to work with some of the similar channel partners that we have currently with other parts of Fortive.","So ultimately we\u2019ll have a little bit more visibility than we do today, but it won't reside with the kind of visibility say that we get at Fluke where we get a pretty decent chunk of the U.S. and European distribution channel partners.","Scott Davis","Okay. Super helpful, thank you guys. ","James Lico ","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. ","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. How's it going?","James Lico ","Good.","Steve Tusa","Just on the different deals, can you give us like the actual revenue numbers for ASP, ISC and what\u2019s the other one, ASP, Gordian and Accruent?","Charles McLaughlin","So for ASP on an annualize basis, I\u2019m going to give you the end market numbers, it\u2019s a little over $800 million this year maybe call it $820 million and I think that you asked about ISC, is it\u2019s north of 200.","Steve Tusa","Yes, sorry, I was asking more about the quarter the actual quarter. So how much in ASP contribute in a quarter and then Gordian and Accruent in the quarter? ","Charles McLaughlin","So nothing on core revenue, obviously. But I think the number -- I want to make sure you understand about the day two countries, that our distributors sets a little bit haircut from what we saw in our numbers. So I think that -- let me just get that number for you really quick now. And then I'll come right back to you.","Steve Tusa","So you are saying you guys have -- the distributors have changed buying patterns something in the near-term?","Charles McLaughlin","No, so outside the U.S., ASP is still being managed by J&J. And they're acting as the distributor. So therefore while you'd expect us to have a little over $200 million in this quarter, because ASP takes a haircut off of their portion of it, say maybe a third of the business. This quarter, we had $167 million hit our reported numbers.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Got it. And then what about Gordian and Accruent?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes they\u2019re just a little bit about -- those two are about a little over $100 million.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And is there -- I guess, when it comes to the kind of shorter cycle businesses, any trends through the quarter that more notable? I mean, did you exit worse than you started? And are you seeing anything so far in July that changes your views on that at all?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, I think Steve, when we talked at EPG, we talked about North America being pretty good. And I think in total that was true. Although it was more Gilbarco and less Fluke and Tek. And we saw June sort of changed it for both Fluke and Tek. So I would say, what we really think about when we think about the second half guide for Fluke and Tek, we really sort of looked at the weeks of supply of inventory, we looked at point of sale, and really reflected that in the revenue drop. So we really think that's probably what we'll see in a second half.","I think the other thing that's probably the bigger change is Europe, we -- I think I said flattish for what we probably think in Europe, we are obviously down low-single digit. And again, that was principally at Fluke and Tek, and they were down more than 2.5, or low-single digits. So what we really ended up seeing is a slower Europe until a point-of-sale in June. So it's really what we try to account for in the second half forecast is that as well. And probably the more precipitous drop between say two, three months ago for the second half, is how -- is our view in Professional Instrumentation for Europe?","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last one third quarter operating margins, what where should that kind of range be for the segments? Because it feel like we have to hit some pretty hard to kind of get to where your guide is.","Charles McLaughlin","So I\u2019d say one I don't think we have to hit them particularly hard. Are you talking about core operating margins, or you just want to\u2026","Steve Tusa","Yes, segment margins for 3Q, however you want to talk about them?","Charles McLaughlin","In the 22-23 range.","Steve Tusa","Yes. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. ","Charles McLaughlin","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. ","Andrew Obin","Hi, good afternoon.","James Lico ","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Hi, just a follow up on Steve questions, you did highlight that Fluke and Tek is driving sort of European weakness. So what exactly is happening in Fluke and Tek, any specific industry trends that are causing the slowdown? And how does it get better and why?","James Lico ","Well, I'll answer the second one, how does it get better I think is much a macro question probably as any right. That's a -- we really decided to put it to be prudent and not assume that it will get better in the second half, Andrew. More specifically, to your first question, I think we saw a more precipitous drop at Tek. Definitely it was channel destocking, but we also saw demand go down. We saw -- so I think from that standpoint, it was across all the product lines, there was certainly an automotive component to that. While that's -- so that's not an enormous exposure to us, but we do sell into the R&D labs of automotive and that was slower for sure. Just as one example of what we saw. ","Relative to Fluke, I think it was -- we saw June drop in point-of-sale. And, to be honest with you, that's also reflected in how we think about the second half as well. So, and it was relatively broad based as well. So I think from that standpoint, it feels more macroeconomic, end user demand, if you will, then it feels just destocking. And, so I think that's how we're going to reflect that's what's reflected and how we see everything right now and we'll look for signs for improvement. ","And, Steve asked how -- and how July looks and that kind of thing, and we're seeing nothing in July at this point that would tell us any different than where we're at right now. It's very early days in July as you know particularly in the U.S. because of the holiday week.","Andrew Obin","And there just sort of also margin you had good pricing in PI this quarter, I think 1.3%, PI core was down 140 bps. So how does core margin and pricing trend in the second half in PI? ","Charles McLaughlin","Hey Andrew, this is Chuck. So, you're right, the pricing was good, but it was a little bit more it was offset by the slowing volume. Although down 140 basis points of core OMX in Q2 has sequentially improved from Q1, I would expect that -- if we -- first of all, if we hadn't had the slowdown, we probably would have been 100 basis points better in Q2 on OMX at PI. I would expect because we're going to start lapping some of the tariffs and continued discipline in FDS [ph] and improving margins that will continue to see sequential improvements from Q2 to Q3 and then again from Q3 to Q4. But I don't think it has -- it will get positive in Q3, but in Q4, I believe that PI has a good chance too.","Andrew Obin","And pricing is sustainable?","Charles McLaughlin","I think I think we put in a lot of price last year. So I think we'll -- the price metric might be a little bit less first half to second half because of all the price we put in last year for the tariffs, but that'll be offset by the tariffs being in the comp. So I think you'll see, the difference between those two things probably isn't much, first half to second half.","Andrew Obin","Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. ","Charles McLaughlin","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","And our next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. ","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. ","James Lico ","Good evening, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey. I would assume that you all follow the same practice that was established at Danaher, that after the 100 days of an acquisition, you reevaluate there -- assess how the integration is going and maybe for ASP you could share what you've learned, positives, negatives, what's gone well, any kind of surprises along the way? And then I've got a couple of follow-ups there.","James Lico ","Well, a couple things. We about 100 days about 100 some days, so we haven't quite finished it. But I've been pretty close to what we've seen and what we've been doing. So I think I've either been with ASP team, either with customers or with them, pretty much every week over the last several weeks. We'll see their 100 day here shortly.","But I think at the end of the day, what we've seen is, is in some of it we really felt we saw in the quarter we really like the market position, it's very clear that the Terminal Sterilization aspects of the market are really important to the hospital, and our ability to sort of expand on that I think we see some real opportunities for FBS, particularly in sales force management, funnel management. We've put in a number of those tools here recently.","I think we see a lot of supply chain opportunities which is consistent with how we saw some of the value creation. So I think strategically, the growth in China was something that we saw in the quarter. And we also think we have a good opportunity in China. That's an important part of how we'll see the future. So I think when you think about it, our U.S. position is good, our Terminal Sterilization position globally is good. And the high growth markets represent some opportunities are three important strategic priorities.","But also the opportunity for FBS to add value is, I think, very consistent, probably even more than we thought. Although it's really early days, we have a lot of work, as we said in the prepared remarks, Deane, around getting through some of these transitions service agreements. So that's going to take us a little while, but we're really excited about the team there and our opportunity to work together with them to really create a really great business over time.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. Just can you comment on those transition services that in answering Steve's question, Chuck talked about the J&J services outside the U.S. when will that end? And then maybe I missed this in the deal closing, but the receivables were not part of the acquisition, was that reflected in the purchase price was that a post-closing adjustment?","James Lico ","We can tag team this one, I think the transition services agreement, we\u2019ve got a lot of work between now and the end of the year. So I would say a big number -- while a lot of little things will occur between now and the end of the year. What we will start to see is that the takeover of a lot of those countries really starting to occur more accelerating into 2020. And as we said in the prepared remarks toward the end of the first half of 2020 is kind when we get this -- get that most of those things completed.","So a lot of work between now and then, we took on Canada as a country that was just recently, but I think a lot of the work from here to the end of the year is really about to doing the spadework the foundational work to be set up systems and things like that. So, it's really good to be in 2020, where you start to see a number of those things occurring.","Deane Dray","About the receivables?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, that was contemplated in the deal from the 0:37:39. So we knew about that I think everybody there were happy with the deal we struck with them that was very fair but that wasn\u2019t a port deal adjustment. ","Deane Dray","Got it. Why don\u2019t you do it with the payables instead?","Charles McLaughlin","To be clear it was receivables then payables. So it is both of those. ","Deane Dray","Good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi Bank.","Andy Kaplowitz","Good afternoon, guys. ","James Lico ","Hi, Andy. ","Andy Kaplowitz ","As we think about the walk to ago from $3.06 in 2018 to new guide of $3.45 to $3.60, the big piece of that change from last quarter\u2019s guide just the lowering of the $0.30 [ph] in core revenue growth contribution and maybe some FX. Was there any lowering of Gordian and Accruent under ASP and then how much did [indiscernible] Pruftechnik add if anything into the core EPS growth?","James Lico ","And so Andy, the only lowering that we done is really about the slowing in our short cycle, primarily in PI. The acquisitions are all performing at or above what we expected. And there has been no change -- we\u2019re not changing anything in our guide about that nor do we expect to. So I think that's the main point of your question.","Andy Kaplowitz ","Yes, it is and [indiscernible] Pruftechnik did they add anything into the EPS?","James Lico ","Not this year, they are -- we -- five months to go there is some deal costs associated with that, but no meaningful earnings up or down for those deals.","Andy Kaplowitz ","That\u2019s helpful. And then, Jim, you mentioned GVR in high growth markets slowed down a bit it looks like it\u2019s just push outs as we talked about, did you guys expecting push outs and we know there is going to be some difficult comps at some points there had to be in the growth markets. Did you see any slowing in the business other than you saw the push outs which have been happening [indiscernible] in second half of the year?","James Lico ","Well I think it\u2019s really two countries. And I think GVR -- the India story I think is very much one -- we won a significant number of tenders and it's just getting things through the contract process and really getting things installed and all that. So we have a very good color on the backlog and feel very good, I wouldn't read anything into the India thing and high growth markets growth year-to-date for Gilbarco is still growing. So it's really the second quarter dynamics of some things in India that are pushing.","There is probably a little bit of slowing in China but that really has to do with just really substantial growth last year through the double wall tank upgrades and we\u2019re still seeing some wins that will be in the second half. So we still see growth in China for Gilbarco for the year, but again a tender or two pushed into the quarter and that\u2019s not unusual in this business quite frankly, for it happen in India and China at the same time maybe that's a little bit unusual. But we feel really confident about high-growth market growth for GVR in the year.","Andy Kaplowitz ","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. ","James Lico ","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","And our next question is from John Inch of Gordon Hasket.","John Inch","Hey, guys. By the way I was thinking considering recent events, you should be congratulated again on the ANF deal. So I just going to throw that out there.","Hey, just in terms of the quarterly growth, organic growth forecast kind of the two to four for the second half, and I think you're assuming two to four for the third quarter and implicitly two to four for fourth quarter. Third quarter has a lot easier comparisons, if I recollect right, because fourth quarter, you had the pre-buy, you had the deferral of Gilbarco Veeder-Root from third quarter to fourth quarter. Is there any sort of assumption you're making that fourth quarter is somehow going to get better or what's really sort of baked into the assumptions here?","James Lico ","I think when we get to the fourth quarter, some of our acquisitions, particularly, Gordian and Accruent are going to turn core and so that does help us against a more difficult comp for sure. And I think that in the third quarter, I think that there is easier comp to last year. But, we've got a little bit wider range than we normally talked about. So I think you can figure out how that might go up from -- we expected at this point from Q3 to Q4. But we're watching what's going on here pretty intently.","John Inch","So there's no presumption of any kind of natural pickup or order trends that come in or something like that. It's just -- just takeaway the way that chips fall, right? ","James Lico ","Yes, there's a little bit there -- as I was just answering Andy's questions, where the India tenders falling, could help a little bit here and there. And so there's a little bit of where those fall. But I think as Chuck mentioned, as you said, a little bit tougher comp in the fourth quarter, but we really get a full quarter of Gordian and Accruent in the fourth quarter. So that sort of makes up for a little bit of that slightly tougher comp. But there's really no expectation regionally or by business of any big pickup within the year relative to core grow.","John Inch","And those businesses are doing well Gordian and Accruent so that's just kind of make sense. ","James Lico ","Yes, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're really happy with the take rate and things that are going on there. And, were so far so good.","John Inch","In last quarter, I think you said point of sale trends kind of began to improve as the quarter progressed and into March, did that all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall and sort of drop and hold or what actually kind of happen from first quarter to second quarter, that might give us kind of a little thought processes as to how we kind of move through the rest of the year?","James Lico ","Yes, you have a good memory. So March, it's really the -- particularly the Fluke point-of-sale trends. The Fluke point-of-sale trends turned up in March, and that made us feel pretty good about things and even in first part of April, they were pretty good. And they held in there a little bit through May. But they did slow a little bit, particularly in the U.S., or particularly in Europe, they slowed in June for sure a big time. ","And what we also saw was just a more days' supply of inventory starting to change and channel partners starting to make some decisions around slowing sell in and even in cases where we might have had consistent sales out. We still saw people -- we typically see an inventory build first quarter to second quarter. So days' supply this is in Fluke days' supply typically goes up a little bit in the second quarter. And then -- and what we saw this year was not that at all.","So clearly people were managing inventory tighter and I suspect it had a lot to do with the uncertainty. So in the case of Europe, we definitely saw sales out go pretty down pretty quickly in June. And in the case of U.S., we started down a little bit, but we saw sell in go slow down and weeks of supply pop-up. So we've put all of those assumptions into the second half.","John Inch","Just last detrimental margins and Fluke and Tek I think they are down in some regions globally, right that you guys have called out. What sort of detrimental are you seeing in those businesses? Again, where there is a little bit of softness today?","Charles McLaughlin","Well, in the short run when it goes down as a detrimental. They're pretty consistent across around the world. There's not one margin that\u2019s really that much different than the others. But they will in the short run go down over 50%.","James Lico ","Yes, particularly when most of it was in June, John. Just a little bit more on that, we're really -- particularly in Fluke, we're really consistent around the world relative to margin structure. So when that stuff happens in the short run. We're obviously working very hard in June and right now to make sure that we improve those as we go through the year.","John Inch","Awesome. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. ","James Lico ","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Eastman of Baird.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Thank you. Hey, Jim, could you just follow up on the question once around tech. I'm curious, I presume KEITHLEY softness is due to the semi market. But you did reference Huawei\u2019s impact there. Can you just kind of parse that out a little bit I would think there were their R&D tools at tech are probably what's a problem for the Huawei entity list? But could you just kind of parse out the growth rate? I think you said tech was down mid-single digit. And what piece was maybe KEITHLEY, and there half and half or is Huawei outweighted there over weighted. ","James Lico ","Yeah so, what I would say first and foremost is you're right around the KEITHLEY really is, as you as you well know. KEITHLEY is very much -- has more semiconductor exposure than the tech as whole, and it has more electronics, manufacturing exposure, as well and More Asia exposure. And so I think the slowing at KEITHLEY was more broad based than just China and more than just semiconductors, but very much, I would say an Asia story. And the Asia, sort of electronics manufacturing story where we saw the slowing. And exactly right it was Huawei, it's mostly R&D tools, and mostly scope.","So our check go through the math. I think the one thing we were very pleased with, as I said in the prepared remarks was the strength of scopes, particularly in the midrange. We continue to grow our sole scope platform, if you will particularly the new platform very well.","Charles McLaughlin","And I think that when you will put numbers to that, I think Huawei was a little over $10 million, let\u2019s called 1.25%. And then I think that -- and roughly KEITHLEY was down about twice that. ","James Lico ","So two thirds and three quarters of the miss is those two. And then the other rest of it is really Western Europe, kind of broadly defined.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just a really quick question around the IT margins op margins, when I look at that the incremental was literally 100% there. And is that largely just -- is that GVR volume absorption? Is that pretty much which delivering that or?","Charles McLaughlin","Well, I think there is certainly volume always helps and can concierge. But also, what's in there is there's always one timers, both good and bad last year was probably a little easier compared the ebbs and flows. Try until it get to focused on any one quarter and back it up and just say, that business when it's growing well, 50 basis points is a good OMX number, but that can do just what they did this score. You see something stronger, I just remember that when goes to zero, one quarter doesn't mean anything either. So\u2026","Richard Eastman","Okay, fair enough. ","James Lico ","And if you look at the segment of Matco had a good quarter as well. And obviously that's a good business for us. So I think the other part of the story probably is we saw some nice -- saw some good things in Matco this quarter as well. ","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just real quick, Jim, did you say Gordian accruing their core growth, I know it's not included in yours, but their core growth was high-single digits did it hold that both? ","James Lico ","Yes. The combined number is probably high-single digits. That's right.","Charles McLaughlin","And that\u2019s tracking that this year is why we're very excited. Yeah, we're encouraged it does playing out like we expected.","Richard Eastman","Perfect. Okay, thank you. ","James Lico ","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse.","James Lico ","Hey, John.","John Walsh","Hi, good afternoon and evening. Actually, following up on that question, one of the things when you got it you talked about macro uncertainly of the short cycle businesses. We always think of CapEx projects. But as you think about some of these more software businesses, Gordian and Accruent, for example. What are the factors you're tracking, whether it's leads or coding activity to have confidence that they can sustain this kind of high-single digit growth rate, when there is kind of this industrial uncertainty out there. But that's not to say you can't spill into other parts of the economy.","James Lico ","Yes, so I would say we look at a couple things. And Gordian and Accruent a little bit different. And maybe we'll talk about eMaint as well. And eMaint would have a little bit more industrial exposure. But as you know with these high recurring revenue businesses, they're not going to necessarily move tomorrow kind of stuff. And so, what we're really looking is the new order bookings, the new customer bookings, to see as we said on the case of eMaint, we had very significant new customer bookings.","So we're really looking at new customer bookings, because that's going to move the needle down the road. We're looking at churn to see if customers are canceling. Sometimes in an economic slowdown, you might start to see people say, well, I don't need all of this, I'll maybe use less seats or whatever, for lack of a better term. So we're looking at those metrics very closely. And quite frankly the people in those businesses are looking at them every day.","So when you look at those metrics, and that's why we mentioned some of the things like iNet new bookings are really good. So, we\u2019re really looking for these high recurring revenue businesses, we're really looking at those annual bookings numbers, and we're looking at the average contract value, what we call ACV, and we're looking at churn. And we look at those three metrics to really understand what is it really gives us a good view of how the business is going to be in a couple quarters.","John Walsh","Okay. And then I think the capacity number as it stands right now north of $1.4 billion, maybe just kind of talk us through the pipeline, and if there's kind of anything do you expect in the near-term?","James Lico ","Yeah, well, I hate to comment anything in the near-term, and quite frankly, we commented on near-term, because some of the deals we were talking about, we've obviously closed in the last 30 days. We're really -- and maybe I'll use the last few as an example, we're incredibly pleased at the deals we got done. The -- this quarter, I mean, when you look at, obviously ASP is a transformational business for us in many respects. And we're really excited about that.","You look at the two businesses, two years ago, we bought ISC, because we're really excited about this, the workflows around safety, and now we close two deals that one is a bolt-on safer systems. It really helps them really gives us a new set of modules to sell on top of the iNet platform and then Intellects really gives us a great new adjacent market for EH&F [ph] software. ","So we\u2019re really well positioned in the workflows one with a bolt-on the other with an adjacency. And then obviously proof technique, a classic bolt-on for Fluke significantly raises our game and condition monitoring and gives us a team that's incredibly experienced at understanding condition monitoring particularly around vibration.","So that's -- those are those are the kinds of deals that are still in the funnel and I think what we've done in the second quarter and early in the third is really when I talk about is a great example of when I talk about breath of the funnel John, we're really -- and that funnel continues to have good breath. Obviously very much in field solutions this quarter, in particular the last three I just mentioned, but we feel good about the funnel and the breadth of the funnel.","Deane Dray","All right, thank you. ","James Lico ","Thank you","Operator","And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolf Research.","James Lico ","Hey, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Good afternoon, James. Hey guys. Just want to revisit ASP, we've added that one a fair bit so far, but I do want to talk about the EBITDA contribution. I think Chuck this might be to you. I'm calculating EBITDA margin on acquisitions about 24%. That's similar to last quarter, I'm guessing Gordian and Accruent stepped up on higher revenues to maybe the upper 20s, with ASP in the teens, is that sort of the right math? And my real question is, if that's the case, given that the TSA don\u2019t really roll off until 2020, should we expect higher EBITDA from ASP through the back half of the year, or that now more of a 2020 story?","James Lico ","Well there\u2019ll be -- so couple of things, I'm not sure I caught the last part about the teams of ASP on EBITDA, but I think when we get to the other side, which is the nature of your question, in the starting out in the mid-20s is a good place for us to be mid to upper 20s is I think where we're going to go. I think that there\u2019ll be some accretion from TSAs in the back half of the year. I think we closed Canada, but that's not a -- they're going to start slow and then they're going to pick up speed. Fourth quarter, there'll be a little bit of whiffed and then continue to accelerate closing more of those in Q1 and Q2 of next year.","So that's the day two country TSAs and then there's an IT system that stand up, and that's not a gradual, that's more of a cut over, that'll happen sometime in the first half of next year.","Nigel Coe","And this is all to do with making sure that you're crossing the checking the boxes on the regulatory side to more than anything else, is that correct?","James Lico ","We're really carving a business right out of ASP. So with that we're recreating more than just the RA QA systems but also several of the other systems in the business, like the financial system, ERP, a lot of those things we already have, but in other places we're adding -- we're creating those things. We're re-creating what they have. So, that's a good part of it, but it's spadework we\u2019ve got to get done. ","Nigel Coe","Yes. And then just a quick follow on, Jim, you mentioned that trend got kind of progressing well through the quarter, I\u2019m not sure if you address whether it seem elements of stabilization in Q3. And maybe just characterize what you seen in China right now and how is the behavior from your customers in China? ","James Lico ","I think when we look at -- as I said that the changes that we saw and really we\u2019re talking about PI here. We saw a little bit slowly in the U.S. it's probably too early to tell whether or not the first couple of weeks of July have really seen a difference. I would say we've seen consistently in Europe and what we saw in June we\u2019re still seeing so that's probably color and China probably similar story. We haven't seen anything that would tell us that the things are moving around to the good or that are getting more negative at this point. But I caveat that with July is generally the first part -- first two weeks, first three weeks of the quarter aren\u2019t always the best view of things. Certainly, as we have a few more weeks here we\u2019ll have a better sense.","Nigel Coe","Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","James Lico ","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jo Giordano of Cowen.","Jo Giordano","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One thing I am trying to figure out is kind of reconcile commentary for like the Tektronix scope type business across some your competitors. And I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s end market variance or geographic, but it seems to be consistent like kind of different commentaries at different times for the three major players within that oscilloscope business. And curious to see your take on that and anything you\u2019d highlight as to what might be causing different trends at different times for you guys?","James Lico ","I would say end market exposure generally is some folks have more 5G exposures, as an example and they maybe more tied to the 5G market, but I think we were pretty consistent with our [indiscernible] business over the last two or three years at least in our case, we\u2019ve been growing. So it\u2019s been on the backs of the investments we made on the new platform and we just launched the three and four series. And so that's now I think two years of launches that we had this was our third launch we did the five series two years ago around this time, we did the sixth series about a year ago. Now the three and four.","And those product lines are all growing and are continuing to deliver growth. So end market exposure will maybe push those numbers up a little bit more, certain customers that kind of things. So I don't dive into the details of what others say in this case, I can only tell you with great confidence what's happening in our business.","Jo Giordano","Fair enough. There is also some news recently your main competitor on the GVR side, making a deal with ADD and EV charging and I know you guys have made some ventures into EV as well, just curious as to an update on how those two markets will melt over time and what the outlook is there for further investment into that avenue?","James Lico ","Yes, I think we're really happy with the tritium investment that we made. I was actually out in Europe a couple months ago with our sales team make calling on customers in Europe. We announced in May our relationship with Identity [ph] where I had met with them, which is I think a great relationship and a great partnership for fast charging. We just got a very large order in the UK to be the largest supplier of chargers in the UK to box energy over the next several years. We\u2019ve announced 2,500 charging locations over the next several years.","So we\u2019re really happy with the relationship and exposure we\u2019re certainly learning the market from them, they\u2019re a great team, we\u2019re also exposing them to new customer base and at the same time, our investment is helping fund some of the operational improvements that are going to be helpful to building the business long-term. ","So, we feel very good about position. I think we all know EV is probably aren\u2019t going to happen as fast as maybe we thought a few years ago, but I think the position we\u2019re in and the place were in right now, we\u2019re certainly seeing accelerated growth and accelerated position through the partnership with tritium.","Jo Giordano","And then, Chuck, just real quick on the lower tax rate guide is there anything structural there or anything specific cause that and how should we think about that going forward into 2020?","Charles McLaughlin","No, I think we were slightly -- I think for the year at 16% for 2019. So in 2020 16%, so probably pretty good -- is a good number to use. What's happened in the first half as some discrete items that are unique to Q1 and Q2 that drove it a little bit lower, but ongoing for a year 2020 is 16%.","Jo Giordano","Okay, thanks guys. ","Charles McLaughlin","Thanks, Jo.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Lico.","James Lico","Thanks, Jason. And thanks, everyone, for taking the time today. We appreciate all your support. And the time you take to understand our story. As we highlighted in May, we are incredibly proud of the work we're doing to change the portfolio. And I think we saw a lot of great transformation really play out in the quarter for us. And we're certainly excited about some of the new things we've done around the capital allocation front with several of the new companies that will join the Fortive family.","We realized that the second quarter was a lower macroeconomic environment for us, I would call it a little bit of higher uncertainty, and some slowdown that we talked about. And so we've been prudent we believe in the second half to really make sure we're managing the business both for the long-term, and also continuing to deliver outstanding EPS growth and free cash flow.","So we thanks -- we think we're in a very good position right now. And while we're not trying to predict the outcome of what the next couple of quarters will be from an economic standpoint, we think we're well prepared for what's out there. We'll obviously continue to have conversations around that and obviously, Griffin and Chuck and our team are available for questions after the call. Thank you and have a great rest of the summer. Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information. We completed the divestiture of the automation and specialty business on October 1, 2018, and accordingly, have included the results of the A&S business as discontinued operations for current and historical periods. The results presented on this call are based on continuing operations.","During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis.","During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future.

Our results for the fourth quarter provided a strong finish to 2019 as we delivered a 13.1% adjusted earnings growth, with strong adjusted operating margin performance and excellent free cash flow. For the full year, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 on a continuing operations basis, representing a 13.7% increase year-over-year, with 2% core revenue growth and 30 basis points of core operating margin expansion. We delivered these results in the face of slow demand dynamics across our short-cycle businesses throughout the second half of the year. At the same time, we achieved significant progress with respect to the continued transformation of our portfolio, closing nearly $4 billion worth of high-quality, strategic acquisitions that accelerate our strategy around software-enabled workflow solutions.","As a key part of our portfolio transformation, we continue to make good progress with the integration of advanced sterilization products. We closed on China before the end of the fourth quarter, successfully integrating the largest of the day 2 countries and accomplishing a key milestone as we bring ASP's global operations under our full control. We remain keenly focused on closing the remaining day 2 countries and ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is in place to enable us to exit the majority of the TSAs as planned by the end of the second quarter.","At the same time, we are pleased with the significant progress that we've made toward the completion of the separation of Vontier. In December, we announced key members of Vontier's senior management team, including Mark Morelli, as President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Nomura as Chief Financial Officer, and we are continuing to work toward an IPO split to effect the separation. While we have put ourselves in a position to be ready for the first step in the form of an IPO of up to 20% of Vontier by the end of the first quarter, we will continue to assess market conditions and maintain a variety of options for the eventual completion of the transaction, which is on track for the second half of this year, as previously communicated.","Given that I've been challenged with the cold for the last week, Chuck will provide the details of the quarter.","Charles McLaughlin","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q4, adjusted net earnings were $368 million, up 13% over the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.03. Sales grew 13.9% to $2 billion based on strong contribution from recent acquisitions and a slight increase in core revenue, which came in largely as expected. Core revenue growth was highlighted by mid-single-digit or better growth at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Gordian, Industrial Scientific and Matco, which was largely offset by declines across the short-cycle businesses within Professional Instrumentation. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 110 basis points.","Geographically, core revenue in developed markets grew low single digits reflecting the continued soft macro conditions in both North America and Western Europe. Core revenue growth in North America was up low single digits, while Western Europe declined mid-single digits. High-growth market's core revenue decreased mid-single digits due to slower performance at Fluke, Tektronix and GVR. China posted a high single-digit decline as strong growth at Qualitrol and Sensing Technologies was more than offset by the headwinds associated with the winding down of the double-wall tank upgrade cycle at GVR and the Huawei-impacted Tektronix.","Adjusted profit margin was 23.3%, representing a year-over-year increase of 60 basis points. Core operating margin increased 150 basis points, driven by solid execution and strong operating margin expansion across the breadth of our portfolio. More than half of our operating companies each generated greater than 100 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we generated $452 million of free cash flow representing an increase of 17% year-over-year. This strong performance resulted in free cash flow conversion ratio of 123% of adjusted net income for the quarter.","Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 23.1% despite a low single-digit decrease in core revenue. The significant contribution of recent acquisitions continue to drive overall growth within professional instrumentation. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 50 basis points.","Segment-level adjusted operating margins were 25.1%, including a core operating margin increase of 130 basis points, which was offset by 190 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Our core operating margin increase was driven by price, supply chain savings and business model execution.","Field solutions core revenue increased slightly, including a low single-digit increase in developed markets as growth at ISC, Gordian and Qualitrol was partially offset by a decline at Fluke in North America. High-growth markets decreased slightly. Fluke improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, but still declined low single-digit year-over-year primarily as a result of continued softness at Fluke Industrial. In North America, Fluke declined low single digits but saw some early signs of stabilization. In China, Fluke declined high single digits as we expected, reflecting negative point-of-sale trends. Fluke Health Solutions grew mid-single digits, led by Landauer which saw strong orders from the U.S. Army for its red watch radiation monitoring device. Fluke Digital Systems grew mid-teens led by eMaint, which posted another double-digit increase in net new customers and greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue.","PR\u00dcFTECHNIK continues to perform ahead of expectations and has greatly enhanced the broader Fluke liability offering. Fluke continues to see excellent momentum from its revolutionary II900 Sonic Imager which generated $20 million worth of revenue in 2019 following its launch at the end of April that year. ","ISC delivered high single-digit core growth, driven by strong growth across North America and Western Europe. ISC's subscription-based iNet performed well, generating high single-digit growth and strong new customer bookings. The momentum at iNet reflects the growing demand for ISC's expanding set of real-time, WiFi-enabled connected worker solutions as more facilities adopt live-monitoring capabilities to improve safety performance.","Intelex grew double digits in the fourth quarter as strong bookings and share gains helped deliver a record year for customer wins with a 17% increase year-over-year in total new customers. The ISC and Intelex teams also continue to make progress with the integration of the Intellex software offering with iNet in order to unlock the opportunity for future cross-selling.","Qualitrol's core revenue grew mid-single digits, marking the first positive quarter for both core growth and bookings since 2017. -- delivered strong growth in North America, China and Latin America, which was partially offset by continued challenges in Western Europe and the Middle East.","Turning to our facilities and asset management businesses, Gordian performed very well in the quarter, delivering greater than 20% core growth. This performance was driven by strong growth across e procurement platform with increased construction volume from large enterprise customers, including the United States Postal Service. Gordian also saw momentum across estimating and facilities planning, reflecting the initial return on strategic investments that we made in its product offering and sales force. With facilities plannings, the application of FBS sales and lead management tools, we helped Gordian end the quarter with its largest backlog in its history.","Accruent saw a sequential growth in the fourth quarter but registered high single-digit decline on a year-over-year basis driven by a tough comparison given the large amount of licensing deals that hit in the fourth quarter of 2018. While the pace of SaaS bookings wasn't enough to offset the licensing revenue decline in the quarter, Accruent to drive better sales execution and productivity with a higher win rate for larger software deals and improve cross-selling. Accruent continues to see strong performance across a number of its key product lines, including its EMS 360 facility and connectivity offerings, all of which generated greater than 20% bookings growth in 2019 and carry strong momentum into 2020.","Product realization core revenue decreased high single digits as PacSci EMC and Invetech was more than offset by continued weakness at Tektronix. EMC generated low single-digit sales growth versus the tough compare from the prior year led by defense electronics and commercial aerospace offerings as we saw momentum with its commercial satellite customers as well. EMC continued to see broad-based bookings momentum, allowing it to maintain strong backlog and excellent revenue visibility for the year ahead.","Tektronix registered double-digit -- a low double-digit decrease in core revenue. As expected in the quarter, Tektronix saw continued pressure from many of the same headwinds that emerged earlier in 2019, including slowing at Keathley, weak demand in North America and Western Europe and the loss of business from Huawei due to U.S. trade restrictions. Tektronix saw strong performance across its mid-range oscilloscopes offering, which grew mid-single digits. The 3 and 4 series scopes were successfully introduced last June continued to perform particularly well, generating high-teens growth and significant share gains in the quarter.","Core revenue for sensing technologies decreased low single digits as broad-based growth in China was more than offset by continued weakness in Western Europe and flat performance in North America. Jim's benefited from improved conditions in the semiconductor end market, which returned to growth in the fourth quarter, removing a key headwind that persisted through much of 2019.","ASP grew low single digits, led by growth in consumables as well as continued strong performance from its service business. Geographically, ASP saw strong performance in China and Mexico. We continue to be encouraged by ASP's performance in Japan, which saw high single-digit growth in the second half of the year after an extended period of weaker performance prior to our ownership. At the end of October, we closed China, and we now have approximately 80% of ASP's global revenue under our direct control. The acquisition of Sensus closed early in the fourth quarter significantly enhanced our connected workflow offerings for central sterilization departments. Sensus is off to a good start with 10% growth in the quarter, and we're excited about the cross-selling opportunities with ASP as we provide more comprehensive solutions to our health care facilities.","Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenue grew 1.9%, including core revenue growth of 3.6%, which was partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rate of 180 basis points. Segment-level adjusted operating margins was 23.8%, including core operating margin increase of 230 basis points. The strong OMX and Industrial Technologies was once again led by GVR, where applications of FBS drove strong margin performance and significantly improved working capital turns as EMV ramp throughout the year. For Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew mid-single digits led by low double-digit growth in North America. GVR generated mid single-digit core growth, led by high single-digit increase in developed markets. As expected, GMAR delivered another quarter of strong performance in North America tied to sustained momentum from EMV-related sales as the October liability shift deadline approaches. GVR registered mid-single-digit decline across high-growth markets as strong performance in Latin America was more than offset by a slower quarter in China and India. GVR continues to see good early momentum with its Insite 360 remote 4-quart [ph] management solution, which enables customers to monitor and update fuel dispensers remotely. They also recently released a new fuel procurement and logistics solution on in site 360 called Halo, which will -- has been well received by the market.","GDR recently received a large order for Trinium EV chargers from a major European oil company, the largest such order to date from a legacy GVR customer. This win, and the potential for a larger opportunity to support a broader EV charging rollout across the customer's network, highlights the opportunity for GVR to leverage the distribution and service capabilities across its existing customer base of Tridien's -- in support of Tridien's continued growth.","TeletracNavman core revenue decreased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations. TeletracNavman saw strong continued growth in Asia Pacific, which was more than offset by declines in North America and Western Europe. The TeletracNavman team continues to work to stabilize its North America business with overhauled customer support processes, reducing the customer churn and enhancing margin. While there is significant work ahead, the TeletracNavman team is making progress with root causes of the higher churn, laying the groundwork for improved performance ahead.","Moving to franchise distribution, the platform's core revenue grew low single digits during the fourth quarter, driven by the strength at Matco. Matco's performance was led by growth across its power tools, tool storage and specialty tools category. Matco continues to benefit from strong product vitality and the success of new product introductions. The power tool category, in particular, was supported by the introduction of the cordless infineum, high-performance impact wrench and high-speed ratchet kit. Matco also induced its maximum light diagnostic scan tool in December, bringing to market the latest extension of Matco's growing diagnostics offering.","With that, I'll hand it back over to Jim.","James Lico","Thanks, Chuck. To wrap up, the fourth quarter represented a strong finish to 2019 with continued momentum from industrial technologies and solid execution from Professional Instrumentation in a challenging environment. Our performance in the quarter provided a clear demonstration of both the power of the Fortive business system, and the increasing resilience of our portfolio, enabling us to deliver 150 basis points of core operating margin expansion in the face of slow short-cycle demand that persisted throughout the quarter.","In 2019, we faced a number of challenges head on from tariff-related headwinds to short-cycle slowing through the back half of the year. Despite these challenges, we delivered strong margin expansion and free cash flow and saw approximately 7% revenue growth across the software businesses we have acquired since spin. In addition, we have made significant progress toward the integration of ASP, while also moving forward with the separation of Vontier to position Fortive for the future. Clearly, there are signs out there, continued industrial slowness, and we're cautious about the macroeconomic outlook for the coming quarters.","With respect to guidance, we are initiating our full year 2020 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance at $3.68 to $3.78, representing year-over-year growth of 6% to 9% on a continuing operations basis. The annual guidance assumes low single-digit core revenue growth, 50 basis points of core OMX and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.70 to $0.74, representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 7%. This includes assumptions of low single-digit core revenue decline and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. Our first quarter guidance also anticipates a $0.02 headwind from the disruption we have seen so far associated with the coronavirus outbreak in China. This is a very fluid situation, and we are monitoring it very closely. Obviously, first and foremost, the safety of our employees throughout China is our top priority.","In closing, I want to take a minute to acknowledge the efforts of the broader Fortive team across the globe. 2019 was a truly transformational year for our team. And while it was not with a year without challenges, I'm extremely proud of how our team performed and responded. It's the dedication of our people and their relentless commitment to continuous improvement to drive the Fortive business system and enable us to deliver greater long-term value for all of our stakeholders. I look forward to the next decade ahead with our outstanding team. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin.","Griffin Whitney","Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Angela, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just the first question around Slide 10, the 2020 EPS bridge. Looking at that piece on the left, the $0.16 of core because I guess I'm trying to understand, because I think the restructuring savings from last year give you about $0.14. And then if you put in core growth, low single digits with that 50 bps OMX, that gets you about $0.16. So I'm just trying to understand where does the restructuring savings -- or the core growth fit in that bridge.","Charles McLaughlin","Well, Julian, this is Chuck. I think that what -- you're doing that roughly correct. I think that it just really depends on how much growth you're putting in there? And then maybe the one wildcard that we're -- we probably got embedded in here a little bit is how long PI stays down. We've got a negative in Q1 here, it's probably flat in the first half and as that continue into Q3.","Julian Mitchell","I see, that $0.16 incorporates both the organic growth and the restructuring savings?","Charles McLaughlin","That's correct.","Julian Mitchell","And then my second question, just maybe help us understand the biggest moving pieces within the PI core margin. It was down a bunch in Q3, up a lot in Q4, and then it looks like it's guided to drop again in Q1. So maybe just help us understand what's swinging that around in the context of sort of steady-ish declines in organic sales.","James Lico","Yes, Julian, it's Jim. First, you're right about Q4. If you sort of think about the second half and what we saw in PI in the second half, we're probably down 20 or so bps for the second half. So a number -- what we saw in Q4 was some really strong pricing. We saw -- we always get a bigger portion of our supply chain savings near the end of the year, and we certainly saw that. So those 2 plus a little bit better mix is really -- would drove the stronger margin expansion in the quarter. As we go into -- you certainly have some headwinds of things like salaries and things like that, that come into the first quarter, that will be part of the offset. But I think part of it is just -- we'll see the big businesses Fluke and Tek, be about the same relative to their contribution. But I think you do see the coronavirus here, and that's principally and that heat is going to be more in PI probably than anywhere else.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","So Jim, I hope you're feeling better soon. So I just want to start on cash a couple of different things here. So there's about $500 million and change of M&A spend during the quarter, was that all in this acquisition, this Sensus acquisition? And then was a bit lower than we expected. Is that kind of better job on Capex? Or was that a push out relative to your original guidance for '19?","Charles McLaughlin","I think I would take the second one first, the Capex. I think that -- I don't think that's appreciably lower or different than we than normally see. So maybe I'd go back and figure out if we gave you that impression, we shouldn't have, because I think we're pretty stable on that piece. And on the first piece you're talking about, how much of the -- are you talking about the deal cost?","Nigel Coe","Yes. Is that all Sensus? Or was it 2 or 3 smaller deals in there as well? What I'm trying to figure out is what -- how big is the Sensus acquisition what should be we modeled for 2020?","Charles McLaughlin","I understand. Yes. No, that's the Sensus acquisition.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Any details you can give us on revenue contribution for '20?","Charles McLaughlin","Relative to Sensus?","Nigel Coe","Yes.","James Lico","So yes, that business is, I think, roughly $50-ish million to figure, double-digit kind of growth, you're probably talking in the $10 million range for the year. That's -- it's mostly a SaaS business. So I think some -- if we think about how that will continue to grow and we think we'll probably put some additional investment in it in order to accelerate growth through the year as we work with the team there. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the combination of Sensus, along with what we've got at ASP, gives us a really strong offering in the central sterilization department. So some of our effort here to accelerate the growth, it's going to be some investment in go to market in order to make sure that we can accelerate that growth through the year.","Nigel Coe","Okay. I don't want to overstay my welcome here but what kind of margin profile does Sensus have?","James Lico","Pretty close, lower operating margins than what we would at the start but high gross margin. So you're talking about gross margins in the 60s. They do have a service business. So the software, obviously, is in the high 80s and 90s kind of range. But then there's a service and installation component to it that brings the margins down. We think we can continue to grow that margin profile over time. And obviously, the operating margins will start to come up. I think they're in the -- roughly the 20s now and they'll probably be in that range this year.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa [ph] with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Just on ASP, what are the organic revenue contributions from that business for 2020?","Charles McLaughlin","It's going to be low single digit, but that probably high -- it's moving up as things -- as we get more of the revenue under our own shop. So I think that's going to be pushing three would be my guess.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, so that includes kind of that push forward of kind of the TSA impact. So we can think about the revenue base and then just grow that by 3%? Or is that kind of the organic growth, excluding the impact from whatever happened last year with the TSA?","Charles McLaughlin","I think the way -- what I'm talking about is how the end customer growth is going to grow, think about that at 3%.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So but what is the actual organic revenue contribution to the [indiscernible] you can define it anyway once. So just as a percentage of Fortive total revenues, the amount you would include as organic from that business specifically.","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, it's probably going to be north of $25 million. On the organic -- just the organic growth. Now keep in mind, we didn't have Q1 in there last year. So [indiscernible]","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. so it's a 9 month. Yes, so it's a 9-month mix in is what you're saying.","Charles McLaughlin","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just on cash flow for the fourth quarter, some things moving around, there was a decent bump from accruals and another kind of decent drag from I think, from prepaids or something like that. Is that kind of the unwind of some of this TSA stuff that you talked about earlier in the year? Was that just organic performance, anything kind of going on there. That was kind of a big swinger year-over-year in the fourth quarter?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, I don't -- I think that there were some those things were probably related to how J&J got us the cash for that business created in the fourth quarter. But I don't think that -- I would say that, that is what you should expect us to be able to do in the fourth quarter. And that, that wasn't an unusual bump there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So it's not like anything was kind of pulled out of 2020. That's kind of a clean base for 2020.","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, it's normal seasonality for us to be really strong in the fourth quarter and later in Q1.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","So last quarter, you gave a view and that organic revenue declines will continue into first quarter and probably second quarter, you sort of reiterated that, I think, today. Do you still see the likely return to growth happening in third quarter? And more importantly, other than coronavirus, what are the 1 or 2 items that could swing that earlier or later?","James Lico","Well, I think as we look at the guide, Andrew, we don't have any dramatic improvement that I would say is counting on a big economic swing our comps get a little easier in the second half. So you have a little bit of that. And we've got some product launches. So I would say if the upside if things were to get better in Europe, I think that would be some upside to us. That would be 1 thing. I think we've got North America, I think we've seen North America fairly stable. If we start to think about some of the places where we see some point of sale, as an example, we've seen some growth lately in point-of-sale. Admittedly, still kind of low single digit, but we're seeing growth. So I think the upside story would be probably China accelerates -- forget just beyond corona, but it just accelerates to a little bit better. In Western Europe comes back to growth maybe sooner. I think those are probably 2 of the embedded things. You could go OpCo by Opco, but I think geography is probably the best way to think about it.","Andrew Obin","Great. And then just a follow-up question on price\/cost. Could it be more favorable for you in 2020? I imagine tariff impact is slowing, and you can still command decent pricing? And how does Phase 1 trade deal sort of figure into your calculation of price cost into 2020, how does it impact you?","Charles McLaughlin","So to take the second piece of that, the trade deal that they just signed wasn't going to impact us either way. And so that's no impact for us. I think that in terms of some of our actions, I think you saw our margin expand here. At the end of the year, reflecting that maybe some of our price will carry into next year. And I'd like to think that in the first half, we've got some good momentum there. I think from a cost standpoint, we don't -- it does not feel like a severely inflationary environment for us. So I think that our position's going to be pretty strong there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","So I guess, just first question on the Vontier IPO. I guess, Jim, depending on which way it top of my head here, it seems like you might come out of this whole thing, pretty close to net debt-free on the Fortive piece. Is that a fair way to think about it and a fair way to think about kind of the acquisition firepower as we get through the transaction.","James Lico","Well we'll certainly be in a good position, that's for sure. As we highlighted in the prepared remarks, about our plan here, still a lot of things to do. I'll let Chuck specifically comment about how we're thinking about the debt structure here.","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, I don't think -- I think we're going to be improved, but especially given if an IPO would net some proceeds and accelerate where we get to. But we're -- both of these companies are going to have M&A firepower here. And so I don't think we get to net debt zero on Fortive. I think Vontier is going to -- we'll take some of the debt, but not a disproportionate amount.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about this $0.16 of core improvement in 2020. I guess, if the demand environment were to firm up, especially in the back half. I guess, what's the bias to reinvest some of the restructuring versus what it fall to the bottom line. I guess, maybe a different way of asking is if growth is better, is it $0.16 plus whatever growth does? Or should we expect some leakage from reinvestment that's currently being held back?","Charles McLaughlin","Well, I think we'd always look for opportunities to where we could accelerate growth. But I think the reason we did the restructuring is so that we could deliver growth. And if we see the back half accelerate. I think we see us deliver our normal VCM fall through of around 35%. And maybe a little bit more. But we'll happily deal with that situation when we see it materializing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Jim or Chuck, can you talk about how you're thinking about GVR in 2020. You obviously still have us GMV related growth. But China slowing in India. I think it's been lumpy lately. I surmise, it's a contributor to 2020, but maybe orders are getting pushed a bit. So you can give us more color on how to think about that business overall and what you're seeing.","James Lico","Yes, sure, Andy. Thanks. So I think the China thing is pretty predictable. We have a double-wall tank upgrade. We've seen tremendous benefit last year from that. And we knew inevitably that, that was going to sort of wane, and that came in fairly predictable. So I don't think China will be a big source of growth for GVR necessarily in 2020. India will, we really have seen more -- we've actually been -- most recently, we've seen some good news on some of our project rollouts. So the first quarter may be a little hit and miss. But I think as we get into the second quarter and in the back half of the year, you're going to see India be a contributor to growth for GVR as well as some of the other high-growth markets. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, Latin America was a highlight for them as well in the quarter. And then maybe the bigger story is now -- obviously, EMV is the big story. Came in really the way we thought it should come in, in the quarter. That will continue to be helpful in 2020. And I think what we saw, which was nice to see was the comments we made around starting to see some of the benefits with GVR customers in Europe with Tritium. So that's a starting point for growth as well. So a number of levers that we think can get them -- will be additive to their growth rate. But EMV still will be the big number there throughout this year.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And then just asking about Accruent, it was starting to flow less quarter, you talked about the conversion to Saas. I think you mentioned high single-digit declines in Q4, given the tough comp. Do you guys think this is more of a just traditional decline, as you called it last quarter? Or is it more cyclical? And what's your outlook for Accruent here in 2020.","James Lico","Yes. If we looked over -- if we sort of get away from the quarters and just look at our ownership of -- we've seen mid single-digit growth at a current since our ownership. So I think what we've seen here recently is, first of all, like we said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing good growth in some of the SaaS offerings. We mentioned connected, which is our health care offering, which did really well. As an example, our EMS offering and our 360 facility offering, which are really parts of our CMMS offering and space management offering. So we saw some good SaaS bookings growth in those businesses. We do have parts of the legacy business that were down, as we mentioned last quarter, and were down more than we thought or thought they were going to be. ","Some of that is larger licensing deals that we had in the fourth quarter of over a year ago, which made for a tough comp. But I think as we sit here in 2020, we look forward with the team, we certainly see our path back to that sort of mid-single-digit and better growth. With the SaaS business, it takes a little while for that to kick in. But we're still very excited about the business. And then we think more broadly, about Gordian as well as what we've done with Fluke digital and eMaint as that sort of almost $500 million of facilities and asset management businesses, those businesses growing exceptionally good. So the market dynamics are good. Like I said, we've got a little bit of work to do at Accruent, we talked about that. I think that's consistent with what we said before. But when we look in total, what we're doing from an all Fortive perspective, I think we like where we're at, and we like the future opportunities as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Walsh","Maybe just following up to some of those earlier questions around the balance sheet. Can you talk a little bit about how the pipelines look like for each of the businesses as we go forward from a capital allocation standpoint and the ability to do M&A?","James Lico","Yes. Well, I think we certainly are -- we completed Sensus in the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, we did intellect as well in the second half. So a couple of very good deals in the second half. In the summer, we had PR\u00dcFTECHNIK. So we had good additions and the breadth was pretty good as well. Intelex really being part of our ISC safety offering, Sensus being part of our health care offering for Tek and really in the core Fluke business. So as we look across those funnels, John, across all of our businesses, I think we're in a very good place with all of our funnels. We just reviewed our strategic plan for the next several years with our Board and highlighted the opportunities for some of our key platforms. And we really see across a number of platforms, opportunities for capital deployment. Obviously, we're pretty busy right now with some of the things we've got going. And -- but we continue to be active, and we're hopeful that we'll get some things done here in 2020 as well.","John Walsh","Great. And then as we think about Vontier, I don't think we've had a chance since you've announced the management team there to kind of get your perspective just wanted to get your thoughts on both the appointment of Mark and Dave there.","James Lico","Yes, we're really excited. I think Mark is a bit -- is a very much a person with who's got considerable continuous improvement experience. He's been a student of DBS and FBS for a long time and has applied it in this businesses. He certainly goes back to back to some United Technology days where they were implementing a number of Lean principles. So I think he brings public company experience, he brings business transformation experience, he's incredibly results oriented. So I think, Mark, is somebody who we're really excited about. And Dave Nomura's really coming back, right? Dave was the group CFO for us before he went to Gates. And Dave's a great financial leader. He's worked with Chuck and I for decades. And I think it's -- we're really excited. Dave knows these businesses. He's coming into the organization knowing these businesses having have some financial responsibility for these businesses before he left. So I think the combination of both external experience, both having public company experience, but also their belief in continuous improvement, I really think sets up already with a great leadership team that we already have in those businesses. We think Vontier's future is very strong with the leaders that we now have in place.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","I really appreciate that you all were brave enough to take a stab at what the coronavirus impact would be in the first quarter. We've seen really 1 other company to go through that math, Xylem did it today. So I'd be interested in hearing a bit more with any precision if you can, what's the -- how do you get that $0.02? Is it the plant shutdowns? Any assumption about the supply chain, maybe we can start there.","James Lico","Yes. Thanks, Deane. It's obviously, as we said, it's an evolving situation, and our first priority is the safety and security of our people over there. And obviously, a very difficult situation for the country of China, the health crisis that it is. So I think, first and foremost, we're focused on making sure that our teams are fine. And we're doing what we can from a business perspective, to help in the situation. We have some products, as an example at Fluke that are helpful to diagnosing some things relative to some of our temperature measurement products as an example. So that's first and foremost. How we got to the $0.02 is really, I think, pretty straightforward. It's really another week of being down. So that's inactivity of not only the factories but also customers. ","And the fact that I think we ramped slower than normal. I've been I've been pretty -- we've talked about China and how you come out of the new year for a number of times. I have a couple of decades of experience of leading our efforts over there. And usually, you come up a little slower coming out of the new year is. And we just think that's going to be a little slower. So it's really the combination of the lost week and really not probably coming up as quickly as we typically would out of the new year. ","Now I'll tell you, Deane, as you know, it's an evolving situation relative to next week. February 10 is really the starting point, which -- and we're really looking at 3 things: one is how are our customers going to come back, how is commercial transactions going to start-up and occur; the second thing is our factories and our Tier 1 and Tier 2 and even tier 3 supply chain, and how quickly they come up, we're pretty confident about our own factories. But seeing the supply chain come up; and then I think the third piece is just the freight lanes. What's going to happen. We do ship, as an example, on some commercial flights, as an example. So we'll just have to see how that happens. And really, all that's going to sort of evolve next week and in the weeks to come as we start to see things. We're -- we've got countermeasures in place on all 3 of those situations. But we have to get into it to see how things play out and how quickly. But we felt obligated with what we've known pretty much over the last maybe 2 or 3 days, we've really felt obligated to be very clear about what we think will happen thus far.","Deane Dray","That's great color. We're all hoping for the best there. And then on ASP and Sensus, interesting, you were citing the opportunities from sort of cross-selling, and that's kind of the whole strategy around bolt-ons. Can you give any kind of examples of what cross-selling might be. And are the sales forces provided any incentives along those lines?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes. So first, which says this is a great business, in and of itself. And so one is the team there is we're going to accelerate some investments and commercial opportunities to really take their solution forward, which we think is a really great solution for central sterilization departments. So that's first and foremost. And then as we said, we've got, in some customers, sets we probably have a stronger position in some places, like IDNs, as an example, they're very strong. So the opportunity for -- to cross-sell within those situations is certainly there, and we're certainly incentivizing the sales force. On a global basis, we probably have more opportunity to take the ASP customer set and introduce Sensus to them because obviously, ASP is such a global business. So really, both opportunities but -- to really cross-sell. But I do want to make sure we emphasize it. We bought a good business to begin with. As I said, over 10% growth in the fourth quarter. That's not in our core number yet. But we think very strongly that this is a great combination for us to go forward with.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.","Richard Eastman","Jim, could you touch a little bit -- circle around to Fluke Industrial. I think you kind of spoke to some seasonal growth there in the fourth quarter relative to the third so that would seem encouraging. How does the channel look to you at this point? And does that business start to cycle more favorably by midyear? Or what's your general feeling on Fluke Industrial?","James Lico","Yes. We saw a little bit better performance in the fourth than we did in the third, and a little bit better performance than we originally thought. And I think that was principally in North America. If we think about point-of-sale trends at Fluke in the fourth quarter the U.S. grew a little bit. Western Europe and China, we're still down. China, off a tough comp. So we really -- we've got to come out, as I mentioned in a few questions ago, corona probably hasn't impacted Fluke maybe more dramatically just given the daily volume of business that goes on at Fluke. So we've got to watch that in China. We think the U.S. continues to sort of stay on track. We don't really see big inventory issues. And in Western Europe, we still think it's going to probably be flattish to down here, at least in the first half, start maybe to get a little bit better based on comp. The inventory positions within the channel are pretty good. So we don't expect any dramatic downturn in the economy from here with these industrial customers. And so you would think that most of the inventory corrections are behind us at this point.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then let me just, again, kind of stay on the short-term business here. But with Tek, I think most of the T&M companies in the electronics side, have their toughest comps with Huawei in the first and part of the second quarter. I mean, not only was business ramping, but we obviously saw the restrictions go in place in May, I think, of last year. But is that the case with Tektronix on the lost business. Is there a functionality from a T&M standpoint? The same? Did it ramp on that same time frame. So comps are very tough, pretty much through the second quarter there? [indiscernible]","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, I mean, I think if the restriction certainly went in, we heard about them right at the end of May, so there's still five months of tougher compares in the first half of this year. There's a little bit in a normal year, a little bit more in the second half than the first half, but I don't think that's enough to worry about it. But it's in the first 5 months of this year and not beyond that.","James Lico","I think the more dramatic number at Tek though, really, Rick, is going to be just seeing that market come back in North America and Europe. That's really that the Huawei thing is something and it's something for Tek. But if we're really think about what's really a larger piece that we usually see 3 or 4 quarters of down -- 4 to 5 quarters of downturn when this sort of turns. And I think that's kind of our current thought. Large -- as you know, while larger purchases get delayed for a little while but they can't be delayed forever. And so we think we'll start to see things start to improve as we get further into the year.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just the last question for me. The core growth for '20, the guide there, low single digits. If I think about PI and IT, it seems to me that PI start off fairly negatively because of these short-term issues at Fluke industrial and Tek. And then perhaps from a core growth standpoint, strengthen in the second half, whereas potentially it starts off strong with some GVR backlog and maybe fades a little bit in the fourth quarter -- by the fourth quarter. Is there much difference between PI and IT as they relate to that low single-digit corporate core?","Charles McLaughlin","Rick, this is Chuck. I think you roughly have PI correctly being negative, especially in the first half running into easier comps but still being low single digit. I don't quite the same way with IT as it goes through the year. I think that they have a little bit of a tough compare here earlier in Q1 versus last year. But I'd expect them in that low mid-single-digit growth in -- from -- or throughout the balance of the year, I don't think, even though the liability shift is in October. I don't think that we'll see a slowdown in this business, especially the -- I'm talking about the EMV wave, that will continue on beyond the end of 2020. So I don't think it slows down the back half of the year on anything I can see.","James Lico","And a couple of things we said before, Rick, just put that in context, like we were talking about EMV, like we just talked about. As I also mentioned, India improves through the second half. So you start to see -- I think electric vehicles the EV charging business probably ramps a little bit more. So you've got a few things that are going to start to accelerate through the year that are non EMV related as well.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.","John Inch","Just picking up on that IT discussion. So if IT is kind of low to mid-single-digit this year, the margins are in the first quarter are -- and I think for the year, are relatively flat. Yes, we've got some of these EMV, I'm assuming those are pretty good profit contribution benefit throughout the year. Why is the OMX now a little bit higher for it based on your guide?","Charles McLaughlin","Well, one, I think IT is coming off of a pretty strong year. But I would think that IT would come through with -- I mean if you're talking about a business, it's growing 3% or 4%, 50 basis points is what you would expect to see. And I think that, that is -- that's what you're going to see with IT going through the year.","John Inch","Okay. So I thought, Chuck, I thought IT was a little bit more flat in your guide in terms of the performance in the first quarter and 2020. But you're saying it's actually going to be up about 50 basis points? Or should we...","Charles McLaughlin","I thought you were talking about operating margin expansion. I'm sorry, but the -- I think that IT will be up in Q1, not taking into account the coronavirus would be about, I think it's 3% and then accelerates slightly through the year.","John Inch","Yes. No, I was talking about operating margin expansion. So we're talking about the same thing.","Charles McLaughlin","They just had a quarter where they did 200. So I think that there's good momentum there, but then they're lapping some really tough compares. They had great margin expansion the last year.","John Inch","That's fair. Just wanted to switch to Vontier for a sec. You've announced the management, what about the Board? Like are the rails going to be on the Board? You would presume they would be, but there hasn't been an announcement yet. What's the timing of that?","James Lico","Well, yes, we haven't commented on the Board. I mean, we've got a lot of degrees of freedom. We've announced Karen as our chair. And so we've got to share. We're building a Board at the construct. We never want to comment on who's going to join the Board or whatever, based on, as you know, commitments and how many boards people are on. I would say that our Board recruiting has been incredibly positive. We've had a number of folks that have been interested. And we're in the process of interviewing those folks. We -- because of the structure we've talked about, we're in good shape for what we need to do for the IPO, and I think we're in very good shape to -- as we move forward with the separation, the full separation, if you will, later in the year.","John Inch","And Jim, what are the next milestones, if anything, from a time line perspective?","Charles McLaughlin","Well, I think we're putting ourselves in position to be able to do an IPO by the end of Q1. But there's a lot of things going on, as we've noted even on this call. So we're going to assess what the best market timing has gone -- is for us. But we'll be in position by that point. But we're really pleased with our progress. And as you mentioned, the management team is in place. And we'll see what the market conditions look like.","James Lico","You'll start to see some of the milestones that would -- be prepared for that, just to be specific, John, things like our filing and those kinds of things. You'd start to see that here in the meetings and things like that in the coming weeks here.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Griffin Whitney for closing remarks.","James Lico","Well, thanks, everybody, for taking the time and indulging me in my minor cold here. But we want to thank everyone for your support in 2019. We -- clearly, a transformational year as we talked about, a number of things that we feel really good about as we enter into the year, we talked about a number of those things this afternoon. It's a new decade for us and a new decade for Fortive, and we're incredibly excited about the position we put ourselves in for both Fortive and Vontier to make 2020 a strong year. We'll look forward to continued conversations around all that. And certainly, Griffin and team are available for follow-up over the next several days. So thanks, everybody, for your time today. Have a great day. And we look forward to seeing you here soon on the road.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Our performance in the fourth quarter provided a strong finish to 2018, capping off another transformational year for Fortive. Looking at the full year, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $3.06 on a continuing operations basis, a 25% increase year-over-year, driven by 4.1% core revenue growth and 35 basis points of core operating margin expansion. The strong top line performance of our core portfolio reflected solid execution against a range of ongoing growth initiatives as we drove product innovation and invested in our market-leading brands in order to continue to enhance our competitive advantage, take market share and position Fortive for sustained outperformance over the long term.","Over the course of 2018, our team significantly accelerated the portfolio transformation process that we have pursued since our spin. During the year, we announced several strategically significant transactions, including the acquisitions of Gordian and Accruent, the divestiture of the A&S business to Altra and the pending acquisition of Johnson & Johnson Advanced Sterilization Products business. These transactions greatly advance our stated strategy to reposition the portfolio in higher growth, less cyclical markets. Taken together, the total acquisitions announced since the spin represent $1.7 billion in total revenue on an annualized basis, growing at a high single-digit rate. These acquisitions, which average 70% recurring revenue, greatly enhance the recurring revenue profile of the Fortive portfolio.","The acquisitions of Gordian and Accruent advance the execution of Fortive's digital strategy which is focused on addressing a range of critical software-enabled workflows for our customers. Both Gordian and Accruent are off to a good start, demonstrating growth momentum through the end of the year.","Turning to ASP. We made significant progress during the fourth quarter employing the Fortive Business System to prepare for a successful transition of the business to the Fortive family. Consistent with what Johnson & Johnson recently announced, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2019. We're very excited about the contribution ASP will make once it's integrated into Fortive, and we look forward to discussing the company and the opportunities ahead when the transaction closes.","With that, I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $325.1 million, up 30% over the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings-per-share were $0.91. Sales grew 11.4% to $1.8 billion, reflecting a core revenue increase of 7.4%. All platforms posted core revenue growth highlighted by Transportation Technologies, product realization and sensing technologies as well as very strong performance of Fluke and Industrial Scientific. Acquisitions, including Gordian and Accruent, contributed 580 basis points of top line growth, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 180 basis points.","Geographically, high-growth markets core revenue grew high single digits with continued strength in Asia and Latin America. This growth was led by Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Tektronix and Fluke. China, in particular, posted a strong quarter with low double-digit growth. While we remain cautious about certain parts of the China market, we are pleased with the continued outperformance in the fourth quarter and our strengthening competitive position. Developed markets' core revenue grew high single digits, reflecting continued strength in North America. Core revenue growth in North America was high single digits, led by strong performances at GVR, Fluke, EMC and Industrial Scientific. Western Europe grew low single digits, led by high single digit growth at GVR and Sensing Technologies and mid-single-digit growth at Tektronix.","In the fourth quarter, we posted a gross margin of 51.1%, our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margins at or above 50%. Pricing accelerated to 80 basis points with four platforms delivering positive price during the quarter. Operating profit margin was 16.8% with core operating margins increasing 40 basis points as strong PPV and productivity were partially offset by the dilutive impact of tariffs in unfavorable mix during the quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we generated $387 million of free cash flow, representing a seasonally strong conversion ratio of 166%. We generated free cash flow for the full year of $1.1 billion, an increase of $180 million or 20% on a year-on-year basis. We were also pleased to see our annual free cash flow conversion increase to 120%, an 800 basis points increase from the prior year.","Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 14%, including core revenue growth of 5.2%. Acquisitions contributed 1,020 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 140 basis points. Reported operating margin of 16.1% reflected 545 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions and transaction expenses. Core margins were flat, reflecting the dilutive impact of tariffs at Fluke and Tektronix and some one-time warranty-related expenses in the quarter.","Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter, driven by continued outperformance at Fluke and ISC and strong growth at Tektronix. Field solutions core revenue grew low single digits, highlighted by mid-single-digit growth in developed markets, including strong performance for Fluke and ISC in North America. This growth was partially offset by a slight decline in high-growth markets due to continued weakness at Qualitrol. China, however, posted a strong quarter with low double-digit-core growth.","Fluke delivered mid-single-digit core growth, led by midteens growth at Fluke Calibration, and mid-single-digit growth at Fluke Industrial. Fluke had a strong finish to the year in China, highlighted by the increasing momentum behind Fluke's e-commerce efforts, which saw strong point of sale increases and continued share gains for its handheld products. Fluke Health Solutions saw a strong contribution from Landauer, which performed ahead of our expectations in its first full year within Fortive. The team leveraged FBS both commercially and in the factory, finishing with mid-single-digit growth and 270 basis points of gross margin expansion for the year and positioning the business to deliver strong returns in 2019 and beyond.","We're excited about the progress we continue to see at Fluke Digital Systems. The eMaint CMMS offering continues to deliver strong growth, up greater than 20% for the quarter and full year. Fluke's innovative sensor offerings were a key element of its digital strategy needed to generate a strong positive response from customers, including the Fluke 3561 Vibration Sensor, which was recently named a 2018 Breakthrough Product by Processing Magazine.","Industrial Scientific delivered low double-digit growth, led by North America and Asia. iNet saw greater than 20% growth for the quarter, while rental revenue increased high single digits. During the quarter, ISC completed the transition of the iNet offering to a fully cloud-based solution, enabling the delivery of better speed and uptime to our customers. ISC's commitment to FBS continues to yield strong operational improvements, including a significant decrease in working capital and related increase in free cash flow over the course of the year. Qualitrol's core revenue declined high teens during the quarter, in line with our expectations, reflecting continued softness across its core geographic markets. We continue to expect the soft market conditions that challenge Qualitrol throughout the year to remain a headwind well into 2019.","Product realization core revenue increased high single digits for the quarter, led by high single-digit growth at Tektronix and midteens growth in EMC. EMC posted a record quarter for revenue as it delivered against the backlog it carried into the quarter, including the volume that had been subject to customer-related delays, as mentioned last quarter. Given strong order flow, EMC finished the year with record backlog, setting up well for continued growth in 2019.","Growth at Tektronix was broad-based across both developed and high-growth markets. Developed markets saw mid-single-digit growth, driven by Japan, North America and Western Europe. We are pleased to see another quarter of double-digit growth for Tek in China driven by strong performance at Keithley. Tek continues to benefit from momentum it has generated from its targeted higher growth end markets. New product introductions remain a key driver of Tek's growth, reflecting the continued momentum behind the 5 and 6 Series oscilloscopes, which saw key customer wins in both the automotive and power end markets during the quarter.","Our sensing technologies platform increased high single digits in the quarter. All of the platforms' major regions saw strong growth, including high single-digit growth in Western Europe and mid-single-digit growth in North America and China. The strong performance in the quarter was driven by industrial and medical end markets as well as revenue shifted from the previous quarter due to hurricane-related delays. We are excited about the number of new product initiatives across the sensing platform that launched in the fourth quarter, including the Setra next-generation industrial pressure transducer, the AXD, which is well positioned to gain market share based on superior range of features and functionality.","Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenue grew 8.1%, including core revenue growth of 10.3%. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduce growth by 230 basis points. Reported operating margin of 20.5% reflected a core operating margin increase of 95 basis points, driven by the incrementals on the strong volume in the quarter.","Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew low double digits, led by greater than 20% growth in high-growth markets and low double-digit growth in developed markets.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered midteens core revenue growth, driven by midteens increase in developed markets and a greater than 20% increase in high-growth markets. Developed markets were led by North America, reflecting strong EMV sales. As expected, Gilbarco continue to see an acceleration in EMV sales, including a major customer win at Murphy's USA and the continued strength of our programs with Shell and Chevron.","China saw midteens core growth driven by continued demand at Veeder-Root for submersible pumps and automatic tank gauges related to ongoing double-walled tank upgrades. GVR's performance in high-growth markets also included significant growth in India and synergies from the combined Gilbarco and Orpak product offering continue to drive share gains to enhance GVR's strong position in that market. Orpak continues to perform well globally, exceeding expectations and generating greater than 50% of revenue from software to enhance GVR's recurring revenue profile.","TeletracNavman declined low single digits as low double-digit core growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset by high teens decline in North America. TeletracNavman continues to perform well in Asia Pacific where the fourth quarter represented the 11th quarter out of 12 with double-digit core revenue growth. In North America, we have continued to experience a high level of customer churn which remains a headwind for the business in 2019.","Moving to franchise distribution. The platform grew core revenue low single digits. Matco delivered low single-digit growth, reflecting strong performance from diagnostic and specialty tools. Tool storage grew low single digits during the fourth quarter, and we are pleased with that -- with how that category performed over the second half of 2018, particularly within our premium tool storage product line.","Matco's Maximus 3.0 diagnostic scan tool platform continues to perform well, driving improving growth in diagnostics category and accelerating recurring revenue opportunities from the sale of MaximusFix, Matco's proprietary subscription-based automotive repair database. The Max 3.0 is expected to be a consistent growth driver in the coming quarters as Matco continues to roll out additional features and enhancements in the platform.","To wrap up, we ended the year with a significantly enhanced portfolio with exposure to better end markets tied to attractive secular drivers, reduced cyclicality, a growing share of recurring revenue and consistently robust free cash flow. This enhanced portfolio has us well positioned to continue to drive organic growth and innovation while also deploying our growing free cash flow into acquisitions that will accelerate our strategy and enhance our long-term competitive advantage. Alongside this portfolio of transformation, we continue to generate strong core operating results consistent with the Fortive formula, driving full year adjusted earnings growth of 25% and increasing free cash flow conversion to 120%. This year, once again, demonstrated the power of the Fortive Business System, enabling our team to execute a series of complex capital allocation strategies to transform our portfolio while driving innovation to better meet our customer need and delivering sustained top quartile earnings growth for our shareholders.","Turning to the guide. We are initiating our full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $3.40 to $3.50, representing year-over-year growth of 11% to 14% on a continuing operations basis. This does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of ASP. The guide also assumes 3% to 5% core revenue growth, core operating margin expansion of 50 basis points, an effective tax rate of 17% and free cash flow conversion ratio of greater than 120% for the year. The adjusted diluted net EPS guidance also reflects the dilutive impact from the mandatory convertible preferred stock on an if-converted basis. The fundamentals across our enhanced portfolio remain strong, and we once again expect to outdeliver -- outperform and deliver sustainable double-digit earnings growth in the year ahead. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.64 to $0.68, which includes an assumption of 3% to 4% core revenue growth, core operating margin expansion of 25 to 50 basis points and an effective tax rate of 17%.","In closing, I'd like to extend my personal thanks and appreciation to our Fortive teammates across the world for their continued dedication to our shared purpose of delivering essential technology for the people who accelerate progress. It is the commitment of our team which provides the foundation for our enduring culture of continuous improvement and it enables us to consistently deliver value for our customers and top quartile returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin.","Griffin Whitney","Thanks, Jim. Before we move into questions, I'd like to take this opportunity to announce that Fortive will host its Annual Investor and Analyst Day on May 16, 2019, in New York City. Further details will be circulated soon. That concludes our formal comments, and we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research.","Scott Davis","I wanted to reconcile a little bit -- guys, and I know you don't have all the answers in the world, none of us do on China, but you said cautious on China, but all your numbers looked really pretty strong across the board. Is there anything in your forward order book or anything more tangible other than kind of what we all read in the newspaper?","James Lico","Well, I think there's a couple of things, Scott. One, yes, you're right, we had another very strong year of performance in China. We finished strong. I suspect some of that had to do with maybe a little bit of business that maybe got pulled in as people were maybe avoiding price increases and stuff, but unbalanced, a very strong quarter fourth quarter for China as you identified. I think we are basing this on a couple of things. One, we're going to sunset some slower -- the -- like the double-walled tank upgrade at Gilbarco, as an example, that's going to slow down a little bit in the back half of the year. So that's one thing that we kind of know. We certainly think that we've seen some -- we believe there will be some slowing of some of the business at Tektronix, and we've seen that a little bit in the order book, still good growth, mid-single-digit growth, but probably a little slowing up as double digits that we've been in. So those are couple of examples. We continue to believe we're outperforming, and certainly it's early days. You've heard me say this a few times that January and February don't tell you a lot in China. You really have to get to March before you have a sense for that. And so I think we'll -- as we turn the corner in the first quarter, we'll have a better sense if that number has some upside to it.","Scott Davis","Okay. Fair enough. And then, I'm normally not nitpicky like this but I'll say it anyways. So your 50 basis point margin guide -- I mean, you lost about 50 bps in a year to acquisitions, I think, on the gross margin line at least, and I would think getting those businesses kind of back to some sort of level of fully integrated and normal could be a nice tailwind. I guess what I'm asking is, how much of that 50 bps is fixing what you bought versus what you're going to get naturally out of your 4% core revenue growth midpoint number?","Charles McLaughlin","So the 50 bps for the year, we've always got things that happened during the year and every year. So there's got some pluses and minuses. And so yes, the -- we will fix some of those things at the end of the year and they won't repeat. There could be other things that come in, but that -- we might have upside to that number for the year. But we are having to overcome the impacts of tariffs. And while we've offset them at the EPS level, when you take price to offset the tariffs, that falls through at zero OMX, zero OPs, so it gives you a little bit of an optical headwind there.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Just a first question maybe on the first quarter guidance. So you have core growth guided pretty similar for Q1 as for the year. EPS, though, is starting out kind of flattish year-on-year with the total year up low double digit. So maybe just help us understand the bridge there. Is it all about a lot of FX headwinds in the quarter? And then the margins, it's the tariff issue and some cost inflation? Maybe just any color on that.","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, thanks, Julian. A couple of things. As you noted, there's FX, we're got $0.04 of FX headwind in the year. Half of that is sitting in Q1. So there's a couple pennies there. Our tax rate is up year-over-year. We had -- it's 17%, still really good. Those are the -- those are probably three big things they caught. And while I think we're guiding nominally lower in Q1 at 3% to 4% rather than 3% to 5% for the year, and that's reflecting maybe a little stronger finish in Q4. I think those are the main puts and takes there.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. And then my second question, when we're thinking about professional instruments, specifically, what kind of core incremental margins should we expect for 2019 in terms of expansion? And maybe how quickly do we see that? Or do you anticipate Q1 you still have a bunch of these maybe warranty issues and inflation to get over? I guess I'm trying to ask how back-end loaded you think the core margin expansion is at PI this year.","Charles McLaughlin","No, so the warranty impact is a one-time that we booked in Q4, and so that's not going to be a drag going forward. Normally, I think what we would expect probably 30% to 40% in VCM's incrementals falling through in the quarter and in the year. And just on the back-end loaded, I think we're pretty level loaded after Q1.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles Tusa","You mentioned the price-offsetting tariffs. What is the level of price you have embedded in that 3% to 5%?","Charles McLaughlin","Probably, well, we did 80 bps of price in Q4, and now we expect it to trend up from there as it has done all year. It might -- it probably would get all the way to 100 bps, 1%.","Charles Tusa","Okay. And then on the -- on GVR for the year, what are you assuming for growth in GVR? And how much of that is a function of -- I guess you mentioned there was the other regulation dropping off, but obviously the EMV stuff is rolling in here. So maybe just talk about how fast GVR can grow and then what you're expecting on kind of headwinds and tailwinds from these various regulatory drivers.","James Lico","Yes, so Steve, it's Jim. So I think we're sort of looking at mid-single digit with -- at Gilbarco right now for the year. They finished stronger than we expected so some of that overage in the fourth quarter was certainly Gilbarco with double-digit growth in the quarter. So we think they're -- well, they're going to continue to be strong through the year. And while the double wall had some impact on our overall China number, in the big -- in the bigger business that we have at Gilbarco, it's not going to be a tremendous headwind. So they've continued to do well in other high-growth markets like India. So we think on balance, their high-growth business will be pretty good this year. Those markets are a little lumpy, so it can move around from quarter-to-quarter, but we think the high-growth markets from Gilbarco will be good this year. And then back to EMV, we feel -- we saw good business, we saw strength, and customers clearly are starting to think about the trends going forward and some of the things that they need to do to be in compliance by the end of 2020. So I think, as we said in July, we saw -- I think Gilbarco played out slightly stronger than we thought where we were when we were in July.","Charles Tusa","Why wouldn't Gilbarco be better than mid-singles than -- if that's the case? Don't you have really easy comps here in the first half of the year? I mean -- or you're just being conservative on this front?","James Lico","I think, like anything else, we -- the year, there's certainly probably potential upside, but I think at the end of the day, we did finish very strong. So the fourth quarter does impact the full year number. It will probably be a little bit better in the first half than that number, and then -- but then obviously were going to have a really tough comp off the double-digit number that we just posted in the fourth quarter. So yes, we'll probably -- you'll probably see some higher growth rates probably as an example in the first quarter. If you remember, we had some ERP issues last year in the first quarter, so we will see probably higher than that mid-single-digit number in the first quarter for sure.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Jim, could you talk about Western Europe actually? I mean, it was up low single digits which is better than last quarter, I think you were down low single digits. And as you know, there are concerns about growth over there. So what actually improved in the quarter? And what's embedded in your growth forecast for 2019 in that region?","Charles McLaughlin","You're -- Andy, you're talking about Western Europe, right?","Andrew Kaplowitz","Yes, correct.","James Lico","Yes, so we were a little better -- still low single digit in the quarter, in the fourth, Andy, than -- so that came in around where we thought it was going to come in, and we've been a little down in, I think, in the third quarter. So even though the fourth quarter was a little better than the third, we still think Europe is probably low to low single kind of environment, maybe until -- maybe touches mid-single, but I think we still are conservative on the European forecast right now based on a lot of the things we've seen, and we all know about and just things we've seen as an example on a point of sale. We had -- one of the drivers in the quarter was Gilbarco. We've had a pretty good mid-single-digit quarter in the fourth, and we don't expect necessarily that to continue through in Europe for the whole year, so -- of 2019, so I think a low single-digit kind of view of Western Europe is kind of where we're at right now.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And I was intrigued by your comments on China in the -- to the extent that you said that your competitive position continues to strengthen there. So maybe you can elaborate that on a bit -- elaborate on that a bit. I think you mentioned e-commerce at Fluke, obviously you're doing well in GVR. So could you materially beat in terms of market share in 2019 and as you go forward versus the market in China?","James Lico","Yes. I think the Fluke performance for the quarter was very good, and obviously we've got a long history there of building products for that market, building and having both production and design capability over there to really build product -- really beat China for the China market. And so I think we just continue to build the business. Ironically, and I think a great example of our benchmark, a lot of e-commerce efforts that we've put in over there really came from Tektronix, and they started that. So I think it's a great example of learning from each other in those businesses. So I think certainly, we have pretty good sense that we're doing pretty well in the places you just mentioned. And our Tek performance is good. It's always hard to gauge against others there from a share position. Things kind of move around, but I think we'll now have had three years in a row of double-digit growth in China, so those numbers feel pretty good. So those are our three biggest businesses, and that's the basis for kind of our belief that we're outperforming, if you will, and I think we can continue to outperform as well.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And you're thinking mid-single-digit growth for China in 2019 based on what you have noted up?","James Lico","That's right. That's where we're at right now. I think as I mentioned before, having been in China a lot over the course of 20 years, January and February don't because the Chinese New Year don't give you a lot of color. You really got to get into March. So our best view right now with what we've seen from a point of sale perspective and what customers are telling us is mid-single digit.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just two things for me. Just first, on J&J, closed maybe a little bit later than you hoped, but relative to your expectation, should we still be thinking about kind of roughly $0.30 on an annualized full year run-rate basis for the first full year of ownership?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, I think nothing's changed from the first four quarters moving forward. I think that's -- I think we said $0.30 to $0.35 last quarter and nothing's changed from that.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay, great. And then with respect to the EMV question, maybe a little bit to Steve's point, I just thought '19 would be a little bit stronger, too, to avoid maybe kind of a big fire drill in 2020 on the compliance deadline. Do you see a situation lining up where 2020 is kind of a big scramble? Or do you expect kind of a smooth acceleration into that compliance deadline?","James Lico","I think what we've seen -- first of all, we had a stronger finish in '18. So that has some -- as I mentioned before. So we still think '19, with the numbers we're seeing, are going to be -- they're going to be good numbers. Jeff, I think at this point, we're starting to think more of the other way, that things are going to move and stretch into 2021 a little bit more. So no one's got a perfect crystal ball here right now, but as we talked to folks, we think people are going to make decisions based on their liabilities, so some of the larger customers are looking at where they're -- where they've had liability thus far, and we'll make some intelligent decisions about their upgrades based on that. So our crystal ball right now probably says things are -- continue to be good, but they probably push into 2021 right now.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett.","John Inch","I think, Jim, you said Tek in China is going to go from double digit to mid-single in 2019. What -- based on the guidance, what actually happens to Fluke and Tek in -- based on your guidance 2019? And what do they do in 2018, if you could remind us?","Charles McLaughlin","Corporate? You mean for China or...","John Inch","No, no, no, I was getting to China data point. I didn't hear what you'd -- if you had said anything about Tek overall. So just what's the Fluke and Tek in 2018 versus 2019 core growth roughly based on your assumptions?","James Lico","Yes, I think Fluke's mid-single '18, mid-single '19. Tek is mid-single, and I think they had a stronger finish in '18. So I think they got them to mid-single, and they're probably closer to low single -- low to mid in 2019. So hopefully, that's helpful.","John Inch","Yes -- no, that's right. That makes sense. The 3% to 5% guide, what about the deals that we've done -- like how much of -- the recently acquired acquisitions, how much do they contribute in the collective 3% to 5%? I think you said -- Chuck, you said pricing's a percent, what about the other businesses that we've done recently?","Charles McLaughlin","Look, so the only thing -- that 3% to 5% is a core growth, so that only include -- it only -- it includes the Landauer and ISC and Orpak. And so I think I calculated it, that was like 30 basis points. The more recent ones, they won't turn core until the fourth quarter of next year.","John Inch","Okay. So still pretty small, all right?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes.","John Inch","And then, Jim, if you were not to read the newspapers but simply just think about your businesses, what are you most concerned about in 2019? So again, not macro stuff because we're also concerned about that, but just if you think about the businesses, how they lined up, what do you -- where do you want to apply the most pressure as CEO in an operations basis? Where do you feel like you've got to kind of focus the most attention if there's an issue at all in 2019?","James Lico","Yes, it's a great question, and probably I could give you -- I could go for a half hour on it. But I would say as we think about -- maybe start with how we think about risk. Certainly, we're -- we -- I think, and it's impossible, not only reading the paper, but also seeing in our own business, and I mentioned this before, Western Europe continues to be a watchful eye. It's not our biggest geography, but certainly some of the things we've seen out of Germany, as an example, would have us watching out to make sure that we're prudent in what we're doing over there. China could go up or down. It's probably a risk and an opportunity regionally. I think operationally, as we think about it from a business perspective, we certainly want to make sure we take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of us relative to GVR and the EMV opportunity. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, as an example, the Murphy's USA order that we got, that was a big win for. We want to continue to have those big wins and to continue to convert those into revenue opportunities and increase our installed base over time. So I would say GVR. And then more broadly, we're always -- John, we're always working to accelerate innovation. We've put a big effort into digital analytics and IoT in a number of our businesses. You see -- you've heard us talk about some of those successes like Fluke Digital. Certainly, Gordian or Accruent are going to -- we're learning a lot from them as well, how to accelerate some things. So that's probably all that -- we're going to have leadership conference here in a few weeks, and those would be -- a number of the things we're going to be talking about and focused on as we talk to our top leaders in the business.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird.","Richard Eastman","Could we just -- can you just give us kind of a quick update on Gordian and Accruent? Just trying to get kind of year-over-year growth rates there. I mean, even though they're not core, I'm just curious, are they pacing out at the growth that you expected and just kind of what the demand and order rate look like?","James Lico","Yes, I think we had a high single-digit growth rate in -- for Accruent last year, and we delivered ahead of where we thought we'd be, although, as we said, only a few months of our own ownership, so we won't take any credit there. Gordian, probably a little bit better from a growth rate, more closer to double digits. And again, they did a nice job as well. So we -- so far, they've gotten out of the gate well. We were with the Accruent team in -- a few weeks ago for their 100-day strategic plan, and the energy and enthusiasm about what they can do and what we can do together is still -- I think is really -- really makes for -- I think both are going to be -- it's going to be great businesses for us going forward. I think you'll start to see those growth rates I just mentioned are probably the growth rates for '19 as we look at things and -- but we'll continue to look. We're certainly looking as we finish their 100-day strategic plans, Rick, as you know, because you know us well. We'll look for opportunities to invest into more growth opportunities to accelerate some of those growth rates and those things -- because of the softer nature of the business, some of those probably won't start to really take an impact until the latter half of '19 and into '20.","Richard Eastman","And do you spend any time at all trying to look and correlate the ABI with Gordian's demand? Could you...","James Lico","Say a little bit more on that. Correlate their demand with?","Richard Eastman","With the ABI Index Construction...","James Lico","Yes.","Richard Eastman","There's a lot of concern around that but...","James Lico","Right, right -- no, sorry, I didn't catch -- I didn't hear the A part of that. The -- no, I -- we haven't found a lot of correlation there yet I think because it's -- in their case, it's such an underpenetrated market that, that's actually happening from projects versus just the ability to grow the business just by increasing the penetration of their offering. It's such an opportunity that it doesn't necessarily correlate as well as one might think.","Richard Eastman","Fair enough. And just a last question, around the PI Sensing businesses, it's kind of your -- maybe your fourth-largest maybe set of businesses, and one would think there's some cyclical sensitivity to those businesses around automation, perhaps around China. But they finished the year strong. Is there anything in the order rate that might give you pause in that -- in those kinds of sets of businesses, Gems and...","James Lico","They're likely to decel a little bit in '19. So they were most -- as a platform, they were a stronger mid-single-digit grower. And in '19, they might slow a little bit too low to mid-single. So I think it's still early to tell but there will be a little bit of slowing that's possible. But I think we still see a lot of opportunities. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that Setra had some nice introductions in technology. We've also seen -- we've taken the businesses into what I would call maybe a little bit less cyclical markets like food and beverage and some critical environment applications. So I think the teams have done a really nice job of trying to reposition the businesses under verticals that maybe are less -- in the less cyclical markets like some of them that you just mentioned.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","I'd like to stick with Accruent and Gordian, if we could. And could you remind us of their deferred revenue profiles and what the cash flow contribution, the free cash flow contribution, were this quarter?","Charles McLaughlin","And so Deane, I think if you're comparing to maybe some other companies about a big prepayment and getting a deferred revenue, that's really not how they're set up. And so I don't think that there's much there and especially moving the needle on free cash flow.","Deane Dray","Just if you gave us a profile of what you expect even if it's not 100%, but what would the free cash flow profile or free cash flow yield for the businesses be?","Charles McLaughlin","I think it will be similar to what the rest of Fortive would be. I just -- I think that it's going to have great margins, but as the -- as that free cash flow percentage of earnings, I think you look at it around the 120% that the rest of the company is. I think that would be great. But when you get that deferred revenue, you can sometimes see it -- you jump off up beyond there.","Deane Dray","Good. And then just still on these two, when you acquired them, you referenced some significant adjacencies for more M&A in this space and how you're feeling about that, and does it make sense to have them in the field solutions piece and might you be breaking these out at some point?","James Lico","Yes, I wouldn't necessarily speculate on breaking it out at any point in time. I certainly think they're -- they fit the mandate of what less is trying to do within the platform at this point in time. Relative to M&A, yes, we have a solid funnel there. As you can imagine, both of them being private equity backed. They had a funnel already working. They -- Accruent had closed some deals right around the time we closed the deal, so they had already brought in a couple of businesses that they were working on. So yes, we like the funnel of both businesses, and we're continuing to look for both small and even larger opportunities where available to bring into the business. And both management teams have good experience in integrating acquisitions. So not only do we have -- obviously we have the capital to do this, but we've got the management capacity in both of those businesses to accelerate growth.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets.","Robert Graham","I want to kind of asking this same question as Deane but maybe a little bit different way. Portfolios, the segment's a little bit lopsided right now. Could we be, a year from today, looking at a three segment portfolio? Does that seem to make more sense?","Charles McLaughlin","Well, I think that lopsided in terms of what we have on board, I'm not sure I agree with that. But I suspect your meaning when we get to the other side with ASP. I think once that we get that on board, we'll take a look and see what makes the most sense. It -- but right now, I think we're thinking about ASP coming on and it will become its own platform. And we'll wait to -- wait until we get to probably till the end of the year before we take up segments.","Robert Graham","Okay. Fair enough. Then the follow-up is simply, again, not to beat the horse dead here, but 3% to 5% organic, just -- as I look at what's coming into the organic in '19, the 17 acquisitions and then we have some also faster growth acquisitions coming in late this year into the core, it seems like 3% organic would be something that you can do in your sleep. I'm just wondering what is the -- what gets you down to a 3% at the low end? What are the things that you're concerned about that you would put a plus 3% after, particularly if you remember also we talked about this at the Investor Day where GDP, GDP plus, I think that there was some thinking about possibly going to numbers and something a little bit higher than GDP. Can you just weigh in on the 3% in particular?","Charles McLaughlin","Well, look, Scott, we agree with you. We're really excited about the businesses that we brought on. The main thing is the Gordian, Accruent and ASP. They -- Gordian and Accruent return into that core number only in the fourth quarter really, and ASP won't turn -- won't be in it at all. So a big -- so I think when you get to 2020, I think a fair comment, but that's the main point.","Robert Graham","But if you could maybe finish that, Chuck, if you don't mind, the 3%, what are the things out there that get you to the 3%? What would have to happen there?","James Lico","I think -- Scott, it's Jim. I think it would really be two things. One, probably, a little bit slower in Western Europe, and maybe China not coming back in that. We called it mid-single digit. There's a range of numbers within mid-single digit. They're probably on the lower end of that mid-singles. Probably the two things that -- I think North America's solid. You never -- it's -- in February, I'm never going to call a year I found that, that's not necessarily a great thing to do with not having an economics degree, but I think the brutal reality is what you we should be doing. What -- we're doing what we need to be doing for a market environment that looks like low to mid-single-digit growth depending on the business. And I think if North America's good, Western Europe holds in there, China continues to be pretty good, the rest of the markets are relatively small, then you start to see the high end of that. And if any of those, I think North America's probably the most likely to stay pretty good and the other two weighing would be where you start to get into the lower end of that guide.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Yes, just to keep on with 1Q, I know -- to go back to we are probably beating the horse pretty dead at this point, but just pulling out the price comment from earlier about the point of price in the first quarter, the comp gets easier, you mentioned GVR feels a little bit better. I guess, Jim, you made a comment about some pull forward maybe in China, is there anything else that got pulled forward elsewhere as best you can tell? Or anything kind of wonky in the backlog? Otherwise, you would think that having January behind you at this point, that the -- that it'd be easier to bridge that out?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes.","James Lico","Yes, I think one is, we think we -- there's probably about 70 to 100 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter that probably is equated to probably was first quarter business. So if you look at our guide, you're -- part of that is probably 70 to 100 that happened. So part of our overage in Q4 is -- and it really comes down to a few things. One, certainly there was a -- there was some business at Gilbarco that -- where people looked at year-end money and decided to spend it and wanted to take those orders in revenue in the quarter. That's one place. EMC had customers that wanted to get content in business, and that went out as well. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, they had their biggest quarter in the history of the company. And then some pull forward of some of the pricing actions that we've got around tariffs that happened at Fluke and Tek. And so those things combined equal to about 70 to 100. And so we go in with, I think, some optimism around North America and China based on how we finished, but we also know that some of what we saw was probably business that would have transacted in the first quarter.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then just to stick with that same line of thought, is there anything on the margin side that we should think about in a 4Q to 1Q bridge? I know there's a lot of moving pieces with the deals and obviously with ASP if it closes in the quarter, that will move it around further still, but anything sequentially that adds on, drops off kind of beyond a volume input?","Charles McLaughlin","No, I think that's the main thing, difference there from Q4 to Q1, especially when you look at what normally happens between these quarters, it's a significant step down, but nothing that comes to mind that's abnormal.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Walsh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Walsh","So a lot of ground covered, but wanted just to get a little more specific. Can you actually give us the ballpark of where EMV revenue ended for 2018 so we just know the jumping off base for that piece of the business?","James Lico","Are you talking about the -- well, we're about 40% through the cycle, a little over 40% through the cycle as we sunset 2018. So that's about where we thought we'd be, maybe a little bit ahead. But we also see, as I mentioned before, that we think it extends out farther. So the remaining, call it 60%, we'll never go to 100%, so -- but the remaining percentage will probably be -- we said -- we've been saying, as you know, John, 85% roughly by the end of 2020. And we think that number's actually pushing out some of -- I don't want to get too specific because it's a little bit a false precision at this point, but we do think that not -- more than 4 or 5 points probably is at least pushing into 2021 at this point.","John Walsh","Okay. And then maybe just to get after the core growth question a little differently, as we think about Q1 and the full year, and I look at your kind of large buckets, whether it's field solutions, product utilization, sensing, right, transportation, you've already kind of talked about some ranges on where you think the core growth is. But are any of those main platforms negative or down in either Q1 or in the full year construct? Or is there growth across all those major platforms in both Q1 and for the full year?","James Lico","All the platforms have growth, John. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the two places where individual businesses might be negative for a few quarters, one at telematics and the other, Qualitrol. So those individual businesses, Qualitrol sits in field solutions, telematics in Transportation Tech, but they're obviously not even close to the biggest businesses in those platforms. So the platforms will continue to grow, but those individual businesses are probably the businesses we're working the hardest to make sure we can turn them around, if you will.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Just on Professional Instrumentation, as I think about Pacific Scientific, Tektronix, a, how did the federal-related revenues do in the quarter? And any impact from shutdown on the ability to collect the book business in the first quarter?","James Lico","Yes, interestingly enough, very little. We had the business booked. We were a little worried about EMC because they do have some resources that come in to approve the products before they ship, but the team did a great job in getting ahead of that. So we really had -- we had a little bit of impact at Gordian, but on balance, probably within the weeds of a company of our size and scale. So thus far, no direct impact. You might say maybe -- and I think it's too early to tell if there's any second or third derivative impact.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","So I hate to really beat the horse to death 2 or 3 times here, but, Chuck, I'm really struggling what the 1Q math and I know a lot of folks out there are as well, so maybe we just explore that again. It seems to me that your organic and FX is basically worked the way outside the top line in 1Q. Could you tell us the expense of M&A roll forward from external and Gordian estimates during 1Q year-over-year? And my math has it -- the effect is down in the third quarter, so I'm really struggling to understand why your midpoint guidance is only $0.01 above the prior year. So maybe some help there, it would be good.","Charles McLaughlin","So one thing I think our tax rate is up in Q1, not down. You said our Q1 tax rate is down.","Nigel Coe","Q1. Okay.","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, our tax rate is going to be 17% in Q1, and I think it was around 15.3% and thereabouts in the prior year.","Nigel Coe","Okay, so nothing else? Nothing smaller? So okay, we'll take it off-line and go...","Charles McLaughlin","So I talked about the -- reiterating as long as we're beating dead horses. FX, $0.02 in the quarter. There's also headwinds, as I mentioned from tax. And we've got more shares this year, it's also given us a little bit of a headwind.","Nigel Coe","Okay, we'll go through this more off-line. And then on the PI margin, again, we've touched on this as well. I think, Jim, you talked about mix, some negative mix I think in PI. I think you're referring to PI. Am I to understand that just Fluke and Tektronix were very strong in the quarter? So was that negative mix in PI, is that a factor why marking the flow? And then how does that -- maybe then, Chuck, if you could just maybe quantify this more because I'm not roughly set up in the -- for February.","Charles McLaughlin","So I don't think there was a mixed impact in PI. I think we had -- there's two things going on in PI, that's -- there's -- tariff is primarily hits, not entirely, but the biggest places it hits is in Fluke and Tek. So that probably gives us 60 basis points of headwind on our OMX. And the warranty is about $6 million, and that's another 40 basis points. As for the company, but so it's a little bit probably 60 -- another 60 basis points on the warranty. So when you weigh those two, those are the two headwinds why we're flat on our OMX, otherwise we'd be at triple digits.","James Lico","And Nigel, I think as we -- it might have been in the prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about mix, but that was overall. That was just a little bit more IT than PI. So that's what we're talking about there. So just a little bit of mix there. That's overall at Fortive. And as Chuck mentioned, the -- he obviously answered all the questions within Professional Instrumentation. So we actually feel pretty good about the margins in PI in the fourth quarter. I mean, obviously we don't love a one-time charge for our warranty issue. But at the end of the day, if you sort of pushed through that, that and combined with the work that the teams did to negate some pretty considerable tariffs, we think we did -- we're really pleased with where that ended up. And I think it put -- kind of put us in a good shape as we get through the year in 2019.","Nigel Coe","That's pretty helpful, Jim. So just to underline the point, Q1 PI, you think core margin's up in Q1?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes.","James Lico","Yes.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen.","Joseph Giordano","Just the M&A impact from acquisitions on PI really stepped up quite a bit from third quarter. I know you have more of the -- more time of Gordian and Accruent in there, but it was a little bit larger than what we're thinking. I'm just curious to see how you think about that bleeding off into '19 like on a cadence basis.","Charles McLaughlin","Are you talking about the step up around the amortization or the step up on the deal cost?","Joseph Giordano","Not the transaction cost, the minus 375 for acquisitions, yes.","Charles McLaughlin","Okay.","James Lico","On the revenue side, yes, I think, well, they clearly, we got full credit for both deals in the fourth quarter. So -- and so I think that number's probably -- obviously, it's going to end -- it will -- it's a -- it will go core at -- in the fourth quarter of next year. So we should see -- the fourth quarter's always seasonally big for those businesses. So there's -- I wouldn't necessarily multiply that number by four.","Joseph Giordano","No, no, no, sorry, sorry. I mean, on the margin side, like the -- on the PI. On the operating margin, you had acquisitions minus 375 basis points. Just curious how that kind of...","James Lico","Yes, they'll absolutely get better through the year. They're -- there's -- we had very little impact on the margins in the quarter given where we closed. And for sure, they will -- they'll continue to improve through the year.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And then a question on ASP. I mean, obviously, sterilization, a big thing out in hospital. So I'm curious how the trend towards like single-use, how like that -- does that have any impact on ASP? Or how does that -- the pull on that two kind of opposite trends?","James Lico","It doesn't because of the products that are used, they typically -- there are products that are not necessarily not going to fall into the single-use category. We've been tracking some technologies where those might be opportunities. But I think when we look at the exposure that our technologies and our products and the products that we sterilize to single-use, there's very little impact. And still a lot of underpenetration around the world. So the U.S. and Europe, obviously, standards and regulations are fairly developed. But when you look around the world -- we were in China a few -- about 1.5 months ago visiting our ASP team, and clearly a lot of opportunity for unpenetrated market there in all forms of hospitals there. So I think it's unbalanced. Yes, some -- there's very little exposure to single-use. And certainly, when you look at the underpenetrated side of the market, lots of growth opportunities. Interestingly enough, I was with a number of the sales leaders, they're here this week. And we're -- we were with them as we roll out some of the Fortive Business System tools with them and stuff, and they're incredibly excited about the opportunity that's available to us. So I think across all fronts, as we get more and more into the business, Joe, we see a growth opportunity.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing that we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Jim Lico for closing remarks.","James Lico","Thanks, Ian, and thanks, everybody, for taking the time this evening. It's cold and snowy in Seattle. That's a pretty rare thing for us. But I think despite the weather, we are incredibly excited about what's ahead of us in 2019. We obviously had a very strong finish to the quarter with over 7% core growth, our best core growth quarter in the history of the company, 30% earnings growth. We think that's great, but it -- on the other hand, we know our best days are still yet to come given the great portfolio transformation work that we did in the year. So thanks for your support, and obviously, Griffin and team are available for questions and clarification tonight and through -- and tomorrow. Thanks, everybody. Have a great night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"9362":["Fortive Corp.

We are pleased with our third quarter results as our teams continue to execute well and deliver substantial core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow generation. The financial performance this quarter demonstrates the strength of our market positions, industry-leading innovation and the diversity of our portfolio amidst improving global end markets. We also took meaningful steps to strategically position Fortive for enhanced long-term growth through M&A.","As we will discuss, in addition to the strong financial performance in the quarter, we were excited to close on $1.6 billion of acquisitions, including Orpak, ISC and Landauer that will contribute key product technologies and strengthen our recurring revenue profile. We believe these strategic portfolio additions and the power of the Fortive Business System will accelerate our growth trajectory and continue to deliver superior returns.","Before getting into the earnings results, I\u2019ll briefly update you on this year\u2019s CEO kaizen event, which we held earlier this month. As we did in 2016, we brought together our top leaders across the company and spent the week utilizing FBS tools to focus on our key growth initiatives. The CEO kaizen provides an opportunity to celebrate our core values and to recognize our culture of continuous improvement. This year, more than 20 kaizen teams advanced to actions across our platform that will deliver accelerated innovation and market share in 2018 and beyond.","With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s turn to the details of the third quarter. Our adjusted net earnings of $271.5 million were up 16% over the prior year, representing the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.77 with an effective tax rate of 24.4% for the quarter. Sales grew 7.5% to $1.7 billion, including a core revenue increase of 4.8%. Revenue growth was broad-based as all six strategic platforms grew core sales and four of six grew core sales mid-single digits or better. This performance reflected the success of multiple product introductions, favorable price, continued performance in high-growth markets and improving industrial end markets in North America.","The favorable impact from acquisitions substantially accelerated to 180 basis points of growth, given the success of our capital deployment and strong business performance in strategic markets. Geographically, high-growth markets grew \u2013 core revenue grew double-digits with continued strength across Asia and improved growth in Latin America. Mid-teens growth in China was led by business wins at Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Tektronix, Fluke and Kollmorgen. Developed markets core revenue grew low-single digits driven by continued strength in Western Europe and improved performance in North America at Tektronix and in our automation businesses.","We posted a record gross margin of 49.8%, an increase of 50 basis points over last year. Operating profit margin was 21.1% in the quarter, with favorable incrementals driving core operating margin expansion of 150 basis points or 90 basis points, excluding the benefit from lower amortization. The widespread application of FBS delivered core operating margin expansion in five of our six platforms. During the third quarter, we generated $287 million of free cash flow and delivered a strong conversion ratio of 107%.","Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 8.7% with core revenue growth of 5.3%. Acquisitions contributed 270 basis points and favorable currency 70 basis points. Core operating margins expanded 240 basis points, which reported operating margins of 22.7%. Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter, led by high-single-digit growth in high-growth markets.","Field Solutions core revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter with both Fluke and Qualitrol posting strong core revenue growth. As I mentioned previously, we\u2019re very excited that we have closed the acquisition of Industrial Scientific and Landauer, which together create a meaningful safety-as-a-service footprint that accelerates our connected device strategy. ISC, a leading provider of portable gas detection equipment and services, is off to a great start and was very quick to adopt our FBS culture. Landauer, which just closed last week, is expected to bring strong recurring sales growth given the strength of its technology and subscription-based radiation exposure services focused in the medical end market.","Fluke\u2019s mid-single-digit growth included solid growth across all regions, particularly high-growth markets. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of improving core growth despite more challenging comparisons. Performance was led by Fluke Networks and Fluke Digital Systems, which includes the key components of the Accelix reliability platform. The Accelix pilots we announced last quarter are advancing with several large customers.","As an example, utilizing the Fluke Accelix platform, a Fortune 100 healthcare company will deploy our condition monitoring solution, which includes power quality, ultrasound vibration and thermal imaging tools. This customer\u2019s facilities are now capable of providing real-time critical alerts to maintenance technicians, allowing full access to their enterprise asset management data via mobile technology. While implementation is still in the initial phase, all the pilots are demonstrating that our comprehensive solution delivers real measurable value through asset reliability and increased uptime.","In addition to these large-scale condition monitoring pilots and the growth of the funnel, we also saw strong double-digit revenue growth at eMaint during the quarter. Fluke maintains its leading market position through innovation, and in the third quarter, Fluke launched a non-contact voltage products we previewed at Investor Day. This T6 family of electrical testers with field sense technology makes work safer by enabling technicians to measure voltage without making metal-to-metal contact. Fluke has already received two innovation awards for this product from distinguished industry associations and sales are well ahead of plan.","Qualitrol delivered high-single digit growth led by further penetration of condition-based monitoring solutions for Europe and Chinese OEMs as well as Middle East utilities. The China market continues to benefit from ongoing investment in high voltage transmission, while offset by the Middle East, where a political instability is delaying budget approvals.","Moving to product realization. Platform core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter led by growth at Tektronix. Tektronix high-single digits core revenue growth continues to be driven by high-growth markets with double-digit growth in Asia. This performance reflects strong sales growth in the semiconductor and Mil\/Gov end markets and high demand for Tektronix\u2019s groundbreaking new product introductions. Sales performance of the Tektronix five series mixed-signal oscilloscope has exceeded our expectations.","Using FBS tools, we executed against our go-to-market action plan to accelerate end user demand. As we previously noted, this new platform will have a more meaningful impact starting in 2018, we are very encouraged by the strong start. Our Sensing Technologies platform delivered high-single digit core revenue growth in the quarter led by double-digit growth in high-growth markets. While market share gains and global industrial stabilization impacted worldwide growth, a key business win in the semiconductor upcycle led growth in North America. One of our new technologies is the Setra Flex environmental monitor, which just recently won the 2018 air-conditioning, heating and refrigeration innovation award in the building automation category. Setra Flex is used to ensure safe and energy efficient indoor environmental and ventilation control conditions in all types of pressurized critical spaces, including operating rooms, biosafety labs and clean rooms.","Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenue grew 6.5% with core revenue growth of 4.4% and sales from acquisitions contributing 100 basis points. Core operating margin expanded 50 basis points with reported operating margin of 21.8%.","Our Transportation Technologies platform posted low single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter, reflecting solid sales growth across the platform. Low single-digit core revenue growth at Gilbarco Veeder-Root came in as expected as demand for EMV in North America slowed versus very strong prior-year double-digit comparisons. Global dispenser sales were up mid-single digits, reflecting continued outperformance in Europe and EMV-related sales growth in the U.S.","High-growth markets core revenue grew double digits, driven by strong demand for dispensers, submersible pumps and automatic tank hinges. Integral to our high-growth market strategy, we closed the previously announced acquisition of Orpak during the third quarter.","In August, Orpak was named the winner and a large fuel automation tender issued by IOCL, which is the largest oil company in India. Orpak will deploy its foresight fuel station management automation technology in up to 10,000 stations. We are very pleased with Orpak\u2019s performance and happy to have the team as part of the Fortive family.","Separately, our thoughts are with many of those that are affected by the devastating September hurricanes across the U.S. As gasoline demand spike in supply was disrupted, our Insite360 fuel the logistics team was able to prevent or significantly reduced our customers\u2019 fuel runout rate across the affected areas.","Telematics posted core revenue growth of mid single-digits in the quarter led by strong SaaS sales growth and increased installed base growth. The success of our new Director platform and the strong adoption of electronic logging devices especially in the small to medium business segment has helped performance in the U.S. as core sales in North America improved sequentially by greater than 400 basis points.","Given this positive trend, we continue to see North America performance accelerate and expect telematics to exit the year at high single-digit growth rate. Automation and specialty grew core sales high single-digits driven by continued double-digit in high-growth markets and robotics. Jacobs Vehicle Systems delivered high single-digit core revenue growth.","Kollmorgen once again posted double-digit core revenue growth, reflecting strong demand across its global industrial automation product line, which is driven by general industrial stabilization and continued robotic strength in Europe, China and Japan. Kollmorgen released the newest servomotor of products, AKM 2G, at PAC Expo in Las Vegas and also launched its latest mobile NDCA 3.0.","Thompson delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth driven by double-digit growth in high-growth markets and strong North American distributor growth. Thompson released the newest addition to their smart actuator family that incorporates a synchronization feature for applications where multiple actuators are used in tandem to move the same load.","Innovation across the automation businesses is driving new project wins to help position the business for future growth. Franchise distribution core sales were slightly up versus last year. Matco core sales were flat as growth in diagnostics was offset by continued softness in tool storage and a challenging hardline tools sales comparison.","To wrap up, we are very pleased with the execution in the third quarter. We have made continued progress towards increasing growth and greater recurring revenue to enhance our portfolio. We\u2019re building a great industrial growth company and we\u2019re doing that with the Fortive Business System. The strength of our cash flow generation and balance sheet positions us well for continued capital deployment towards acquisitions as we leverage the Fortive formula to continue to deliver strong earnings growth.","We are raising our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance range to $2.82 to $2.86, which includes our core revenue growth expectation of mid single-digit and an effective tax rate of 25%. We continue to anticipate core margin expansion of more than 50 basis points for the year and free cash flow conversion of approximately 105%.","We are also initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.74 to $0.78, which includes assumptions of low single-digit core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 24%.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Lisa.","Lisa Curran","Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Kirsten, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi, guys, good afternoon.","Jim Lico","Hey, Scott. Good to hear you.","Scott Davis","Thank you. Thank you for making easy quarter on us and the last thing \u2013 I needed to know it was GE type quarter. So thank you for given that\u2019s a clean number and good cash. But I\u2019m kidding aside, I think I missed some of the service out when you did Industrial, Scientific and Land \u2013 Landauer, I guess, it is. How do they \u2013 are there synergies with the Fluke business and Qualitrol? Or are there \u2013 they\u2019re both kind of software-as-a-service businesses. I mean, they\u2019re \u2013 and detection. Is there a way to bring these things together and get kind of extra synergies if you will?","Jim Lico","Yes. Exactly, maybe a little bit. ISC, first and foremost, will be a separate operating company for us but will clearly have some synergy with the Fluke team. Rest in the team have really seen some opportunities to really combine this sort of what we view \u2013 what we deem is the term safetenance, which is to really take the maintenance professionals, it\u2019s really a core part of the Fluke business and make sure that they have all the safety equipment that\u2019s just core to the technologies at iNet, at ISC.","So there\u2019s certainly a nice synergy there that the team\u2019s working on. And with Landauer, they\u2019re real positioned in the hospital with radiation services, really goes well with a number of product technologies that we have in the Fluke biomet business, probably more directly synergistic with that business. So certainly, some synergies there. So great business, it\u2019s independent, really but we also make sure we take advantage of a number of the synergies. We\u2019re off to a great start at ISC as I said in the prepared remarks. Just closed Landauer, but we\u2019re really excited to have them on the team as well.","Scott Davis","And then these \u2013 are these fragmented businesses where you\u2019ve got an opportunity over number of years to roll them off? How does the structure than industry stand right now?","Jim Lico","Probably a little bit different. We like to \u2013 this portion of the gap, as you know, several of our peer companies have rolled up several safety companies, but we really see ISC as very different gas detection play, really focus more on their recurring revenue model and how they really go-to-market really is directed at specific kind of customer that really marries well with the Fluke customers. So probably less of a roll up strategy directly within the product technology. But some opportunities to sort of build on the software and data analytics capability that we have within the portfolio today or might add to the portfolio down the road. And same will be true for Landauer as well.","Scott Davis","Yes, that sounds interesting. Well, thank you for that. And I\u2019ll pass it on. Good luck guys.","Jim Lico","All right. Thanks, Scott. Good to talk to you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good afternoon. Just a question firstly around transportation tech. So it looks as if that business maybe down or GVR specifically maybe down slightly in the fourth quarter. So maybe just discuss, I guess, if that\u2019s the case and how long you think that type of softness persist thereafter? And maybe give a little bit more color as well on dispensers, specifically, because I think one of your competitors have talked about a pickup recently in orders there, but the 10-Q commentary suggests not in your case.","Jim Lico","So yes, first, maybe more broadly around where we\u2019re at with Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We had a good quarter. They did the sell-off double-digit growth. And as you know, Julian, we\u2019ve had double-digit growth in that particular part of the market for number of years here. So little bit of slowing in North America, but we think that probably accelerates a little bit into the fourth and into the first quarter. So break down, low single-digits in the fourth and maybe slightly worse than that. But that probably persist into the first quarter, and then we\u2019ll sequentially get better through the year. We still think Gilbarco can grow in 2018.","So still an opportunity for margin expansion in the business with that sort of growth profile. And they\u2019ve obviously done an exceptional job thus far. So that we had a great quarter into Spencers around the world, one of our best quarters I think that we\u2019ve ever had. So a very strong quarter for us and as we see globally, I think, I never take stock into what\u2019s happened in the first couple of weeks or anything like that.","So I think we\u2019ll see a little bit of flowing here for a little bit, but as we look at the market, we have \u2013 this is one of those things where because we have such connections with the top 300 customers. We have a pretty good sense of what they\u2019re going to be doing here. So as we look at things, we certainly see a little bit of an air pocket here for the next couple of quarters, but we\u2019re still pretty confident on the rollout as we look out over the next two years or three years.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you. And then just my follow-up would be I think gross margins had a nice expansion in Q3 having been flat in Q2. Is that really all about pricing? That seemed to get stronger in both businesses in the third quarter.","Chuck McLaughlin","Julian, this is Chuck. Yes, we\u2019re happy to see our third quarter gross margins expand as we expected across the business. We saw really across the portfolio strong performance. Our prices as we mentioned as a piece of that with 50 basis points. But when you mention back in Q2, when we didn\u2019t see as much, that was coming off of a really tough compare. And when you look year-to-date, we still felt confident about getting the kind of gross margin expansion that we saw and expected into Q3 and expected to continue into Q4.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Chuck McLaughlin","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Hi guys, good afternoon.","Jim Lico","Hi, Andrew.","Chuck McLaughlin","Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just some questions on product realization. Looking at the queue, it seems that it\u2019s slow down sequentially, but then your commentary on Tektronix was quite positive. It\u2019s been a nice boost to growth this year. Can you just give us color what happened in the quarter and how does the growth rate look into the year-end? Thank you.","Jim Lico","Yes. Yes, sure. Product realization really makes up, really two big businesses, Tek and EMC. The Tek, as you mentioned, had a very strong quarter on the back of both good market work, but also the product introductions and innovations that they\u2019ve launched in the quarter. So we think they\u2019ll continue to see strength. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, North America picked up a little bit for Tek as well, which was good to see on the back of some of this innovation.","EMC had a little bit of a tougher \u2013 they had a very tough compare. We had talked about a bunch of backlog, last year had moved from the second quarter and the third quarter given them exceptionally strong third quarter last year. So they were banking against the big comp. But their book-to-bill is very strong and we feel very good about their growth for the year. So I think when you take that stock at that, I think product realization, we\u2019ll have a good fourth quarter.","Andrew Obin","And just to follow-up on Landauer, now that you own the business, what are the most obvious sort of targets for cost synergies or just sort of cost takeout, how does that look now that you own it versus when you bought it?","Jim Lico","Well, we\u2019ve owned it for a very short period of time, but nonetheless, I think we certainly feel that the public company costs will come out. That certainly is, I would say, probably easy to do. We certainly think there\u2019s FBS opportunities even in the early days. The management there has been excited about those opportunities. Obviously, the Wes Pringle and the leadership of Field Solutions are very good at FBS, and so their ability to apply that will give us some opportunities. There\u2019s some global go-to-market synergies as well.","We\u2019ll be able to leverage the sales force that we have there in the Fluke business, particularly in the bio \u2013 what we called the biomed business. So both cost synergies indirectly some FBS opportunities plus some synergies maybe not necessarily cost takeout, but to really leverage scale that we\u2019ve already invested in Fluke.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. Thank you.","Jim Lico","Thanks and great day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Hi, good afternoon.","Jim Lico","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Hey guys, how is going? So just wanted to dig in, just want to make sure, I heard that low-single digit growth in 4Q, I think that\u2019s what you said, Jim. So just wondering, trying to kind of, I think, the impact of Transportation Technologies within that? And then maybe just any color you can give us in terms of how that PI and industrial.","Jim Lico","Yes. I think \u2013 PI will be good in the fourth quarter. A lot of the things we talked about in the prepared remarks in places like Fluke and Tek, which are some big part we\u2019ll continue to see. Sensing we\u2019ll continue to do pretty well. So I think we feel good about where PI is. As we mentioned in the remarks, we are seeing a little bit of an industrial North \u2013 particularly North America, a little bit of pickup in the industrial markets. Certainly saw that with peer companies as well as some of our customers like Granger and West Coast.","So I think we feel good about the trajectory of the business, not just from a market perspective, but also from a lot of innovation we have. So PI should be \u2013 should have a good quarter. Really, the move down in, we\u2019re also banking against the little bit tougher comp in the fourth unlike a lot of folks, we had very good fourth quarter growth rate that we\u2019re comping against. So when you look across the portfolio with the exception of Matco probably still slow, Gilbarco down a little bit. But other than that, the rest of the portfolio should be in pretty good shape.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And the comps I think gets up at the in 4Q. You definitely a little bit earlier to launch in the recovery. And then maybe a question for Chuck, on the free cash flow, the guidance is 105 for the full year? But I think you\u2019re in the maybe high 80s year-to-date. Maybe just give us some color in terms of what\u2019s being taxing free cash flow year-to-date in the conversion and what changed them in 4Q?","Chuck McLaughlin","Hi, sure, Nigel. First of all, 88% year-to-date is about where we would normally expect to be. And because the first half of the year especially the first quarter, we have a little bit lower revenue and then we pay out there\u2019s some onetime payments, ICP and whatnot goes off in Q1. And then we finished much stronger more like 130-plus percent in Q4. That\u2019s just normal. So we really think we\u2019re at a good spot here and tracking right to 105.","Nigel Coe","Right. Thanks, guys.","Jim Lico","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Good afternoon.","Jim Lico","Hi, Rich.","Richard Eastman","Maybe I\u2019ll just quickly address this to Chuck. Just from the standpoint of when you look at Landauer and maybe also with ISC, those two business models have a pretty high recurring revenue kind of subscription oriented model. How \u2013 can you give us some help as to how they come into Fortive\u2019s P&L either accretion or just it\u2019s a big chunk of the revenue of either of those businesses have to be deferred?","Chuck McLaughlin","No. I think that next year \u2013 when we get into next year after that normal step up of just in terms of the acquisition after the first few months. No, it will come in pretty much as you\u2019ve seen them in standalone in 2018. And so we\u2019re going to see that revenue. And as you mentioned, Landauer has got over 80% of recurring revenue that may be pushing 90%. And ISC is an evolving and they are in the 40s but grow increasing that percentage. So both of those things are going to be trends that help us going forward.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And just from the standpoint of adjusted EPS, again, maybe math suggest that certainly with Landauer that with first year synergies that maybe can both of ISC and Landauer each contribute something high-single digit $0.01 per share, call it $0.08 or $0.09 per share each.","Chuck McLaughlin","Each? No. I think when we look at the three-year rightly, we like the returns on both of those deals. That sounds a little bit rich in the first year, but both are going to be accretive and be a driver for us next year in 2018. We\u2019re going to give more color when we give our Q4 results in terms of what guidance next year. But both of those expect to be accretive next year.","Richard Eastman","Okay, I understand. And then just Jim, in the industrial tech segment, when you look at the automation specialty business, some of that, Kollmorgen, Thomson, some of that \u2013 much of that goes through distribution and with the pressure on these industrial distributors, certainly in North America given, it can be Amazon effect. Are you seeing anything, any push down on pricing to Kollmorgen, to Thomson from that channel?","Jim Lico","We\u2019re not. No, we aren\u2019t, Rich and I think there\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. We\u2019re a little bit more on the specialty channels here as when you think about Kollmorgen\u2019s motor businesses as an example, it\u2019s really not maybe more \u2013 it\u2019s more custom applications with OEM, even if we bring that through distributors. It tends to be more \u2013 we\u2019ve got more content from a customization perspective. And so we tend to not see \u2013 we don\u2019t really play in a commodity market. And I call it commodity, but really it\u2019s sort of general space. So I think it would not be unusual for us to not see that sort of price compression that existed with those channel partners.","So as we mentioned, 50 bps of price in the quarter and it was pretty good across the portfolio. So from that standpoint, we continue to believe that we can get a little bit of price. We mentioned a couple of innovations in the prepared remarks, both at Kollmorgen and Thomson, which is the two biggest piece of automation and that really helps obviously give us better gross margins in the portfolio because a big part of the FBS is making sure that our innovations have better gross margins than the products that they replace.","Richard Eastman","Understand. Okay, great. Thank you.","Jim Lico","Thanks, have a good day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good day, everyone. Just a couple of quick ones. Jim, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how to think about kind of the rollout of new products at Tektronix? You alluded to a stronger performance next year. Are you talking kind of simply than annualization of what\u2019s happening in the back half of this year? Or is there another wave of SKU count coming, et cetera? Or maybe what type of growth contribution you\u2019re looking for there?","Jim Lico","Yes. So we launched of the five series at the tail end of the second quarter. That\u2019s really part of the largest contributor to what we saw in the third. That\u2019s our new midrange oscilloscope. As we mentioned, that\u2019s a start of the platform product that we\u2019ll have a number of other new generation products. So there\u2019ll be another version that coming out roughly next year around the same time. We\u2019ve got a couple of other products that are a little bit lower volume that contribute to it as well in a couple of different \u2013 maybe high rent categories, what we call the bit error rate tester or BERTScope as well as our arbitrary waveform generator. So two other products that are more higher end defense, mil gov, advance research, or in a data center or in it. So a number of those will also be launched.","So when we think about where tech is, it\u2019s probably still little early to see whether they\u2019re going to pan out for the year next year. But we continue to see strength there. We talked about China. We\u2019re starting to see some of the developed markets get a little bit better on the back of some of these innovations. So certainly, the annualization will be an impact next year, particularly in the first half. But we\u2019ve got another wave of product that should keep it in growing throughout every quarter next year.","Jeff Sprague","Right. And then thank you. I guess, speaking of waves, a little M&A wave starting here. What\u2019s the pipeline look like? Should we expect anything else before year-end perhaps? Or maybe give us a little color on the final?","Jim Lico","Well, yes. It\u2019s always hard to say, but we feel really good about what we did in the third quarter. And quite frankly, what we\u2019ve done since the start. When you think about the traction we\u2019re getting in deals like eMaint and GTT that we did around this time last year as well as the bigger deals that we transformed or transacted, excuse me, in the third quarter. There is still \u2013 the funnel still is really good. We\u2019re as busy as we\u2019ve ever been. So we continue to be busy with opportunities. And we feel good about where we\u2019re at. You never know if we get something done or not, we\u2019re always working on things, but you never know.","So we feel good about where we\u2019re at and where we\u2019ll be. I think the other thing may be expecting another question is certainly, things are \u2013 there are things that are expenses. You certainly see that certainly as the market goes up, but I think what we\u2019ve been able to find is opportunities for good returns. You certainly see that with a portfolio of things we\u2019ve done. So while pricing obviously has moved up a little bit as the market has gone up particularly in public stock, we clearly have seen opportunities to still have those kinds of returns that are important to the company.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Yes. Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Jim Lico","Hey, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Just a quick housekeeping items. Is the 20% tax rate, is that kind of the sustainable rate going forward now? Or is that \u2013 is there something kind of unique about this year?","Chuck McLaughlin","Steve, great question. No, I think that 25%, where with the average for the year is probably is what I\u2019ll guide you to next year. The one thing that\u2019s happening this year is the accounting change with the option, the benefit from option exercises. I think we believe that\u2019s uniquely impacting this year. We\u2019ve also done a great job. The tax team has done a great job getting the tax rate down into the 25%, a little ahead of schedule. But I think, 24% is probably \u2013 we\u2019ll get there someday, but not next year.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So 25% next year.","Chuck McLaughlin","Yes.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then just on the acquisition pipeline, can you maybe provide a little bit of color on if there are any big fish swimming around out there? Or pretty steady state? What\u2019s your appetite for deals here over the next, call it, I don\u2019t know, nine to 12 months?","Jim Lico","Well. I think, we really are \u2013 I know we maybe sound like a broken record, I apologize for that a little bit. But we really do have a good balance though. Certainly, a couple of bigger things came out with Landauer and ISC, but we\u2019ve got a number of \u2013 the funnel it\u2019s pretty balance around large things, certainly from things, that would be great bolt-ons to some of the businesses as well, so a good balance of those things. We certainly have the capacity to do a number of things, so it\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re not in any way inhibited by what we just done. I think the free cash flow generation, the strong profitability, we\u2019re going to have double-digit earnings. We\u2019ve obviously had it for three quarters in a row. We expect it for the next several quarters and certainly all of next year. So I think that certainly gives us the ability to do a number of things. I think one of the best things about where we\u2019re at right now is a number of degrees of freedom that we have.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. And sorry, one last one. I jumped in a little late. I\u2019m not sure if anybody asked about semiconductor \u2013 the kind of sustainability, what\u2019s going on in China semis. If somebody already asked about it, then don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll read the transcript. But I just want to get your take on how sustainable that is and what kind of visibility you have in the next year.","Jim Lico","So no, one asked it. So I think we\u2019ll have a great year in and particularly, probably the biggest aspect of that is in China where we\u2019ve been benefiting from that with Tektronix. We saw a number of other parts and semiconductor improve in some of our smaller businesses like sensors, et cetera, and other places, which doesn\u2019t necessarily move the needle necessarily for the overall company, but certainly gives us a sense that things are actually getting even a little bit better, so and the little bit more broadly. So we feel good about what that market will look like into 2018.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. Just go back to price for a moment. You said 50 basis points in the quarter. If you kind of go across the portfolio, what are you getting the most price? And where are you finding it tough? Or do you actually have negative price in areas in the portfolio?","Chuck McLaughlin","Hey, Deane, actually, it\u2019s very balanced across most of our companies. There\u2019s a few point places where I think maybe this would have a bit \u2013 a little bit where we didn\u2019t get as much at tech. They brought us a new product that are actually seeing good margin lift and they really have got a mix thing going at I believe with China and the rest of the world. But we don\u2019t see it there as much. And also, I think in probably telematics is down a little bit as well. But that\u2019s the competitive market and that\u2019s not unusual. Although we\u2019ve seen some good price realization, coming up as we go forward as the ELD has been rolled out. So even there, we\u2019re seeing improvement, but it\u2019s really strong across the portfolio.","Jim Lico","Yes. Maybe just to add on, Deane. A lot of folks have talked about price cost and we\u2019ve been a really good shape relative to cost. So the price aspect of this is the incremental have been really good. So as Chuck mentioned, it\u2019s good to see across the portfolio. And with the fact that our procurement supply chain teams are doing such good on the cost side, that\u2019s why you see the continued confidence in our gross margin improvements.","Deane Dray","Sure. And then just as a follow-up, since it is such an important bellwether, the Fluke business, how it look on the sell in versus sell-through across our distributors?","Jim Lico","Yes. We get the best data in North America and Europe even though we didn\u2019t around the world. But North America look pretty good. Sell in, sellout was relatively close. We didn\u2019t see any inventory build whatsoever, so I think if we look \u2013 if I look more broadly in North America around places where we get channel sellout on balance, all pretty good number. So I think sustainable for at least in the \u2013 these are all short-cycle businesses, but at least within the year, we think things stay pretty good. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard. So I think on balance, Europe is \u2013 Western Europe is kind of the same way. Pretty good. So we do get pretty good inventory levels from distributors in Europe as well and we haven\u2019t seen any inventory building \u2013 build up as well. So sell in, sellout is looking pretty good right now.","Deane Dray","Good to hear. Thank you.","Jim Lico","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good afternoon, guys.","Jim Lico","Hi, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So Qualitrol had high-single-digit growth again decent for the penetration of [indiscernible] you talk about that in Europe and China. Can you talk about the business is doing there to achieve that kind of growth? Because when I look at competitors, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re growing at that piece. And they seem to be suggesting that, it\u2019s a little more choppy than you guys are seeing, so it seems like you guys are taking share or [indiscernible] different parts of the market than they are.","Jim Lico","Yes, a couple of things. One, we\u2019re pretty local in China. So it\u2019s an example, so we really have a good business not only with \u2013 also with the Chinese OEMs. So we really have a broader, probably a broader business than a lot of others that maybe sometimes you hear about. We have a little bit of maybe advantage of loss small numbers, too. But I think, I\u2019m balanced, our team is executing exceptionally well. And so we continue to think that the way the investments are going in China will continue to do well at Qualitrol into 2018, at least we expect that.","I mentioned you didn\u2019t ask it a little bit. We did note that we are seeing a little sluggishness in the Middle East, particularly in places like Saudi Arabia. So we\u2019ve seen the balance just as we look out in the near term. We think a strong China certainly overwhelms that. But we are seeing pockets of things where we are seeing a little bit of budgetary constraints.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. Jim I want to ask about Jacobs Vehicle Systems, then down and then flat, now would actually turn to high-single digit growth. So can you talk about the outlook for that business? Is it going to be with a heavy truck market coming back here, high single-digit growth business going forward, what are you seeing in that business?","Jim Lico","Well, I think you\u2019re exactly right. We\u2019ve had a just an outstanding strong business there in China over the last couple of years. We really built a great business there. But as you know, the North American market was sort of offsetting that until recently. So North American market getting better, probably next year still not at peak levels, but probably certainly better than this year. We\u2019ve got a little bit of mix with Europe where we are losing some business in Europe that will probably slow the business down a little bit that\u2019s maybe going to take a little bit of the growth rates. But we would anticipate at least for sure North America and China growing next year. And overall, the business will grow.","Andrew Kaplowitz","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Thank you. Hey, Jim, the low single-digit growth, did you call out any of the businesses? I couldn\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t remember from your answer. Did you call out any of the businesses in the fourth quarter that you\u2019re expecting to perhaps slow sequentially?","Jim Lico","Yes. I\u2019ll give them back here. We would see \u2013 we would expect Gilbarco to probably sequentially be down in the fourth. They were not down in the third, so that\u2019s probably the biggest change of really trajectory sequentially.","John Inch","Okay. That makes sense. Was the deal cost, Chuck, in the quarter that kind of kept the PI margins a little bit lower in terms of the sequential down?","Chuck McLaughlin","I\u2019m taking through the answer in the sequential margins that, that deal \u2013 certainly, deal cost in the quarter. We look through them for \u2013 from the earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share. So they are not really hurting our OP margins at all.","John Inch","I was just thinking, PI margins were over 24 in the second quarter and they were down, but obviously, I\u2019m just wondering if deal costs played a significant role in that. That\u2019s all.","Chuck McLaughlin","So let me come back to you on specifically. I know we had it. I\u2019m just wondering on that on the margin expansion that you\u2019re talking about, how that rolled in there, but it likely did.","John Inch","Okay. Landauer fits, obviously set depending on how you look at it, right? It looks pretty pricey. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get the benefits out of it over time. Your other \u2013 the rest of your pipeline, I\u2019m sure, we\u2019d be expecting because \u2013 it was a little bit of headline, Chuck. Should we be expecting similar types of multiple revenue types of deals coming forth? I was just kind of the priciest of the ones that just happened to hit?","Chuck McLaughlin","Well, we did three deals in the quarter. All have different profiles. All had similar return profiles. So as you know, we tend to focus on returns, so that\u2019s \u2013 I certainly think that there will be times when a great asset becomes available and we will really \u2013 if we can get the right returns, we will take the opportunity. That doesn\u2019t mean that there is a new trend here. As I mentioned before, prices are higher for some things. But we\u2019ve been pretty disciplined. I think we found a number of things, what we paid for Orpak as an example was, I think, was very good. So if you look over time and you look over what we\u2019ve got, and certainly think you\u2019re going to see a mix of prices as you look at multiples of revenue or multiples of EBITDA. But I think on balance, you\u2019ll see us still maintain a discipline around returns and, on occasion, you\u2019ll see those situations where the opportunity is so good for our transformational like thing that will take advantage of it.","John Inch","But you have to admit that Landauer will be screening that toward the high end of what the\u2026","Chuck McLaughlin","Yes, I would say Landauer is going to typically be at the high end of that. That\u2019s for sure.","John Inch","Okay.","Jim Lico","John, sorry, to interrupt you. I just have the answer back on the transaction costs are about 140 bps impacting Q3 of this year in PI.","John Inch","Okay. So that kind of helps to explain the sequential trend.","Jim Lico","On a sequential, yes. We\u2019re still up year-over-year.","John Inch","You are. You just actually had a really good quarter in PI last quarter. So we just made the sequential compare tough. Let me ask then just lastly here. We\u2019re obviously, once we get over this air pocket going to roll into some pretty nice growth rates at EMV. Probably going to go on for two or three years. Then there\u2019s a this whole notional kind of concept of the cliff, and I\u2019m just curious, Jim and Chuck, how are you thinking about that now? Is it so far or it doesn\u2019t really matter? Or do you actually think about beginning to manage around that so that could be adding to the diversity of the GVR business or it could be actually potentially divesting it before hand or \u2013 is it just \u2013 how would you respond to that kind of concept today?","Jim Lico","Well, I think it is a transformational like situation. But I think what we try to do is do a couple of things. And it isn\u2019t too far off for us be thinking about it, so that\u2019s maybe the first question. As you know, we have a broad discussion around strategy for a long period of time amongst all our business, not only amongst with Chuck and I, but also with the board around what are the degrees of freedom. I think there\u2019s a couple of things that we\u2019re really watching. One, we\u2019re building our transportation technologies with a number of opportunities to really make sure that we are taking advantage of all the kinds of disruptive technologies that are going on and that certainly will be something that we\u2019ll mute some of the things were talking about.","We\u2019re building a global business at Gilbarco Veeder-Root so the acquisition we just did with Orpak is helping us build out our high-growth infrastructure. You see some of those things with some of the successes we\u2019ve had for instance on global dispenser that we described in the prepared remarks. So we\u2019re certainly taking \u2013 making sure that we\u2019re looking through this. And then other thing we\u2019re trying to do is build more recurring revenue models. So that \u2013 yes, we might see it dip, but we won\u2019t necessarily see the dip in margins.","So our Insite360 strategy is really bringing on all of the number of sites to make sure that we\u2019ve got recurring revenue with those sites, adding to that with more software over time. And it\u2019s a number of those strategies that are going to work to mitigate that while at the same time, trying to determine how we can best take on that business in a way that will be \u2013 will mitigate any potential bubble out there.","So we\u2019re certainly working on it. I think it\u2019s a little early to be very specific about what we\u2019re actually doing, but we have a number of things going on right now that are working to \u2013 and we talked a lot about things like Insite360. And some of the payment things we\u2019re trying to do as well to build this business for the long-term, which ultimately keeps maybe it has a little bit of a downturn in that revenue. It\u2019s specifically at Gilbarco North America, but on balance is offset in the number of other parts of the portfolio.","John Inch","Yes, and you\u2019ve got time to work it through. Okay, thank you guys. Appreciate it.","Jim Lico","Thanks, John.","Chuck McLaughlin","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Evelyn Chow","Hi, everyone. This is Evelyn Chow on for Joe. Maybe stating with Matco for a second. I know last quarter you had some softness in the storage area. It seems like overall, trends are moving in the right direction. As you think about this business and what you\u2019re hearing from your dealers and your customer surveys, at what point do you kind of feel this can get back to you that low to mid single-digit type grower.","Jim Lico","Yes, I think, what we highlighted in the prepared remarks, was a tool storage was still weak, so we\u2019ve continue to see sort of the high ticket items, Evelyn, sort of still be more challenged in the portfolio. We think that\u2019s pretty well tied to mechanics hours and what\u2019s going on there. We see less hours with mechanics, less dollars on their pocket, less likely to buy the high ticket items. We did see some of our diagnostic lines have really good growth. So \u2013 and in some of the day-to-day stuff is still doing pretty well.","So we expect that some of those challenges will continue to happen through likely the first part of next year. That\u2019s when you start to see the vehicle production that happened in 2010 start to take on. We think about vehicles that are seven or eight years old as a big part and so what we\u2019re seeing right now is that 2008, 2009 dip in vehicles coming into that age where they need the most maintenance. So as the 2010 and 2011 vehicle production numbers come in, you\u2019ll start to see those mechanics hours bump up. And that\u2019s roughly around the summertime of next year.","Evelyn Chow","That\u2019s very helpful. And maybe revisiting something from last quarter. I know you had a great quarter in 3D sensing. I think at the time, you were kind of still gauging the broad opportunities of your business. Just wondering how that thinking has evolved?","Jim Lico","Yes, we probably we\u2019ll see anything right now there\u2019s \u2013 as we look at our type of solution and the kinds of applications that exist, I know everybody thinks that all 3D sensing opportunities are alike, but they\u2019re not. And so we do think that there will be opportunities in 2018 and 2019 for 3D sensing. We would expect to see some revenue from that, but that\u2019s a customer-by-customer story and not as broad-based as maybe the overall theme is going.","So we feel good about what\u2019s going on in Tektronix and Keithley. We feel like we have a great opportunity to take advantage of a number of opportunities. One of them to be 3D sensing, but it\u2019s not necessarily the massive trend for us and sometimes you read about when you think more broadly about that technology.","Evelyn Chow","Thanks everyone. Have a great night.","Jim Lico","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hey guys, how are you?","Jim Lico","Hi, Joe.","Joe Giordano","Maybe just, most of my stuff has been answered. Just a question on Landauer. So can you talk us through what the growth, organic growth has been there for the last couple of years? And how do you guys \u2013 is most of the \u2013 your philosophy to grow that business more leveraging your existing businesses, like can you talk about Fluke, IC?? Or do you have like what\u2019s your strategy to grow that business on its own outside of potential revenue synergies with those stuff?","Jim Lico","So I think they were flat for a couple of years. They\u2019ve been growing this year, but they were flat for a couple of years based on a number of things, one of which was a challenged ERP implementation that was really hurting them from a resource perspective. We think they\u2019re on a better trajectory right now.","As I mentioned before, we think being able to utilize some synergy that we have with our global footprint, leveraging the bigger business will essentially double the size of our healthcare biomedical business with the addition of Landauer. And the combination of that will really create, we think, a number of growth opportunities, growth initiatives to bring some solutions \u2013 new solutions, but also to leverage the global go-to-market in ways that quite frankly Landauer couldn\u2019t necessarily leverage with their size.","So that\u2019s really where the opportunity and we think we can turn it into a grower year. They\u2019ve been growing last couple of quarters, so we think it will continue to be able to manage that growth over the next several years. But it will take a little while to get some of that work done. Some of that is not stuff that happens in the quarter or two, but in order to get the return, we feel we can get a really good return there. It\u2019s a combination of some obviously, the opportunities to bring out peers to the organization, but also to deliver accelerated growth in the business as well.","Joe Giordano","Is it more of a new product introduction upgrade kind of call there? And just remind me what the recurring element is. I know it\u2019s high, but I\u2019m forgetting exactly how?","Jim Lico","The recurring is close to 90, I think it\u2019s a little bit above 85, so it\u2019s a very good recurring revenue model. And it will be \u2013 they have some good technology, so we feel good about the technology. We\u2019ll obviously continue to invest in innovation. That\u2019s one of the things that, I think, a hallmark of our business, so we\u2019ll continue to do that. And I suspect that will create some new opportunities, but I think we\u2019ll get good some of the growth will certainly come from this geographic expansion of their current product portfolio.","Joe Giordano","Okay, thanks guys.","Jim Lico","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel.","Patrick Newton","Yes, good afternoon Jim and Chuck, thank you for taking my questions. Most have been asked and answered so I have somewhat of a nuanced question on Tektronix. I believe that this business is number one in services within the targeted markets and we\u2019ve seen a major initiative from key side to focus its business on both servicing its own equipment and also third party equipment. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any changes in the services market giving this competitive initiative?","Jim Lico","Well, yes, I think obviously everybody \u2013 the first initiative that everybody tries to do is to service their own equipment. That\u2019s \u2013 I think it generally has an advantage in doing that. And then as you said, the multi-vendor services opportunity. We had a very good quarter and services to attack this quarter. So we feel like we\u2019re actually getting a little bit of the tailwind in the business from some of the work we\u2019ve done and feel good about it.","So it\u2019s big market, there is a lot of third party people. It would be more than the right assumption to think that both us and Quayside could clearly grow in the market together as we \u2013 because there are \u2013 the market is mostly third-party labs and calibration to do that work around the world. So the opportunity for OEMs to do this is still pretty big even if they\u2019re not necessarily competing.","Patrick Newton","Great. And I guess just shifting gears back to an earlier question you had on 3D sensing, you kind of set that for a market for Fortive that is perhaps not as big or as broad as some of the 3D sensing applications. And I\u2019m curious why that is? Because I believe that your initial initiative that Keithley gain traction and actually was the very widely known consumer electronics release with the iPhone X and facial recognition. And perhaps I\u2019m wrong, but why is that test application not widely applicable to similar consumer electronics types of applications? Or perhaps I missing something within your prior answer?","Jim Lico","Well, first, I would never comment on the customer of ours, given our inability to comment on what customers we have there. I think first and foremost, there are specific applications where we do pretty well. I think it has something to do with the level of quality and how you approach of testing. So not every consumer electronics customer approach of testing that way. There\u2019s a couple of different ways to get them in today and, if you will, from a testing compliance capability and certain companies don\u2019t go this intervention as others.","So we\u2019ve latched on to a certain technique, if you will, that really bodes well for how we do it in our technology. That isn\u2019t necessarily everybody will do things like facial recognition. But that said, we do think there\u2019s a broader opportunity here and we are building out some capability from a applications perspective to be able to build solutions for some of the product applications that might exist. We just \u2013 that\u2019s very, very early days and it will be premature to comment on the success or failure of that at this point.","Patrick Newton","Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","Jim Lico","Thanks Patrick.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today\u2019s call. I will now hand it back over to Lisa for any additional or closing remarks.","Jim Lico","Thanks Christina. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call today. We\u2019re exceptionally excited about the third quarter, so I\u2019m setting kind of our one year anniversary of doing the call on our own and we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019ve got going here in the fourth quarter and into 2018.

Today we reported first quarter results that reflected the solid start to 2019 setting us off to deliver another year of strong double-digit earnings growth. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was in line with our expectations, as the performance of Industrial Technologies, led by strong growth from Gilbarco Veeder-Root was partially offset by near-term headwinds within Professional Instrumentation. ","We also generated strong free cash flow growth of greater than 30% in the quarter, reflecting the vitality of our businesses as we continue to invest in organic innovation and pursue acquisitions that will accelerate our strategy.","On April 1st, we closed the acquisition of the Advanced Sterilization Products business from Johnson & Johnson welcoming the business and its employees to the Fortive family. We're very pleased that we closed this complex carve out on schedule in just under 10 months. The $2.7 billion transaction represents our largest acquisition to-date and provides Fortive with a strong position in the attractive $4 billion mid-single-digit growth medical sterilization and disinfection market. ","With a strong global installed base and leading brand, ASP brings growth, high recurring revenue and significant earnings potential to the Fortive portfolio. While ASP is our most recent acquisition, we are excited about the progress being made by the other acquisitions closed over the past couple of years. Gordian and Accruent have continued their early momentum, generating strong growth through the first quarter of 2019. ","Likewise, ISC, Landauer and Orpak are performing well as they embrace the Fortive business system in order to deliver enhanced go-to-market execution, innovation and improvements in free cash flow. The growth of these businesses continues to drive the evolution of the Fortive portfolio toward a higher growth less cyclical profile. ","We look forward to sharing more detail about our progress when we're together at our Investor Conference in May.","With that, I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $245.6 million, up 6.7% over the prior year and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.69. Sales grew 6.7% to $1.6 billion, reflecting a core revenue increase of 3.7%. Core revenue growth was highlighted by the strong performance of GVR as well as Industrial Scientific and EMC. Acquisitions, including Gordian and Accruent, contributed 580 basis points of top-line growth, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 280 basis points.","Geographically, high-growth markets\u2019 core revenue grew mid-single-digits led my Asia and the Middle East. China posted another strong quarter with high single-digit growth, led by GVR, Fluke and Tektronix. Developed markets\u2019 core revenue grew low single-single-digits, reflecting continued strength in North America and strong performance in Japan. Core revenue growth in North America was mid-single-digits, led by GVR, Tektronix, EMC and Industrial Scientific. Western Europe was relatively flat as strong growth at GVR and Qualitrol was offset by slower growth at Fluke and weakness at Tektronix.","In the first quarter, we posted a gross margin of 51%, including 160 basis points of pricing. Reported operating margin -- profit margin was 13.6%, reflecting 240 basis points of dilution from acquisitions and 190 basis points of dilution from deal-related costs. Core operating margins were down 70 basis points, as stronger volume at GVR was offset by lower-than-expected growth at Tektronix and Fluke and unfavorable foreign exchange rates across the company.","During the first quarter, we generated $137 million of free cash flow and a seasonally strong conversion ratio of 84%. Free cash flow generated in the quarter represented a 31% increase year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of greater than 120%.","Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 8.7%, including core revenue growth of 1.8%. Acquisitions contributed 950 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 260 basis points. Reported operating margin of 14.4%, reflected 740 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions and deal-related costs.","Core operating margins decreased a 190 basis points, reflecting the weaker-than-expected revenue growth at Tektronix and Sensing, the impact of tariffs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single-digits as strong performance in Industrial Scientific and EMC was offset by lower growth for Fluke and Tektronix during the quarter.","Field Solutions core revenue grew low single-digits with low single-digit growth in developed markets paced by continued strong performance of ISC. High-growth markets grew slightly as solid growth at Fluke and ISC was largely offset by continued weakness at Qualitrol. China posted another strong quarter with mid-single-digit core growth.","Fluke generated low single-digit core growth, led by double-digit growth at Fluke Calibration. Fluke\u2019s industrial growth in the first quarter was impacted by slower point-of-sale trends in Western Europe and the United States and a stronger finish in 2018. We did however see improvement in point-of-sale growth in North America over the back half of the quarter. Fluke Digital Systems grew greater than 30%, led by eMaint which added more than 50 new customers and generated a greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue.","Fluke continued its strong broad-based growth in China with point-of-sale increases reflecting the enhanced strength of Fluke's competitive position and healthy momentum as it ended the quarter. On the product front, Fluke Networks launched two new fiber testing and inspection products during the quarter, which have gotten off to a strong start.","ISC delivered high-teens core growth led by North America. iNet saw another quarter of greater than 20% growth while rental had a particularly strong quarter driven by several large project wins. The ISC team is very excited about continuing to pursue the emerging revenue opportunity from bundled solutions that combine iNet with the company's rental offering in the coming quarters. ","ISC delivered over 500 basis points of operating margin expansion in the first quarter as the application of FBS continues to drive consistent operational improvements. Qualitrol's core revenue declined low-double-digits during the quarter in line with our expectations. While the company has started to see some early signs of more stable conditions in certain markets, we continue to expect the headwinds from soft market conditions to remain a challenge throughout 2019.","Product realization core revenue increased low-single-digits. This high-teens growth in the EMC was moderated by a flat quarter from Tektronix. EMC saw strong base business growth along with the continued progress of its product offering for commercial satellites with the first launches of satellites employing its fully networked pyrotechnical lead solutions during the quarter.","Flat growth at Tektronix was a result of contrasting performance across developed and high growth markets during the quarter. Developed markets grew low-single-digits led by strong growth in North American and Japan, which was partially offset by a decrease in Western Europe. ","High growth markets were down mid-single-digits as a strong quarter in China was more than offset by declines in South Korea and the rest of Asia. The Tektronix oscilloscope offering continues to drive growth benefiting from the momentum behind the 6 Series MSO which was introduced in the third quarter of 2018.","As part of the ongoing effort to reshape and focus the Tektronix's portfolio, the company also recently signed an agreement to contribute its video test and monitoring business to a new entity, formed with Telestream and Genstar Capital, Telestream's private equity owner. We expect the transaction to close at the beginning of the third quarter.","Core revenue for the Sensing Technologies platform decreased low-single-digits in the quarter. Sensing had a slow start to the year experiencing headwinds across certain parts of its core industrial end markets, including slower demand trends from electronics and semiconductor OEM customers. ","Growth remained solid across the platform\u2019s medical and defense end markets while recent new product launches continue to drive strong growth in critical environment applications. The platform performed well in China registering high-single-digit growth and was offset by low-single-digit declines in North America and Western Europe.","Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment, revenue grew 4% including core revenue growth of 6.4%. Acquisitions contributed 80 basis points, while unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 320 basis points. ","Reporting operating margin of 16.3% reflected 20 basis points of dilutive operating margin associated with acquisitions. Core operating margin increased 130 basis points driven by the strong volume at GVR in the quarter.","Our Transportation Technologies platform core revenue grew low-double-digits led by greater than 20% in high growth markets and high-single-digit growth in developed markets. GVR delivered mid-teens core revenue growth highlighted by low-double-digit increase in developed markets and a greater than 20% increase in high growth markets. ","Developed markets were led by North America reflecting a combination of accelerating EMV sales and the lapping of ERP implementation issues that affected performance in the first quarter of 2018.","Gilbarco continued to generate strong growth from EMV sales, driven by programs with major oil company partners. Phillips 66 recently announced the release of outdoor EMV capability for its sites running the Gilbarco Passport point-of-sale system. Gilbarco also reached the agreement Shell to offer EMV ready Passport EDGE point-of-sale solutions to Shell\u2019s dealer network on a monthly subscription basis. ","China saw greater than 30% growth, driven by the continued regulatory tailwind at Veeder-Root from ongoing double-walled tank upgrades.","GVR\u2019s strong results in high-growth markets included significant growth in India as GVR's comprehensive product and service capability, including recent innovation within Orpak automation offering led to a number of large tender wins during the quarter. ","As expected, TeletracNavman declined high single-digits in the first quarter as strong growth across Asia Pacific was more than offset by a decline in North America. The TeletracNavman team remains focused on stabilizing the North American business where the high-level of customer churn that emerged in 2018 remains a headwind despite some improvement during the quarter. TeletracNavman was recently awarded a FedRAMP provisional authority to operate making its Director product eligible for procurement by all federal agencies based on its security and reliability as a third-party cloud solution.","Moving to franchise distribution. The platform declined low single-digits during the first quarter. Hennessy\u2019s performance was impacted by significant customer inventory reductions while Matco was up slightly. At the company's Annual Tool Expo, Matco launched an exclusive mobile AC recycler line optimized for uptime and service reliability has been well received by the market and drove shop equipment growth during the quarter.","Turning to the guide. We're updating our full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.55 to $3.65, representing year-over-year growth of 16% to 19% on a continuing operations basis. The revised annual guide includes $0.20 for the addition of ASP and a reduction of $0.05 due to the Tektronix video transaction. The guide also assumes 3% to 5% core revenue growth, 25 to 50 basis points of core OMX and effective tax rate of 17% and free cash flow conversion of greater than 120% for the year. ","We are also initiating our second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.86 to $0.90 representing year-over-year growth of 18% at the high-end. This includes assumptions of 3% to 4% core revenue growth and an effective tax rate of 17%.","To wrap up, our first quarter results came in as we expected despite the near-term challenges that impacted our shorter cycle businesses as well as headwinds from tariffs and foreign exchange. For the quarter, we delivered high single-digit total revenue growth, mid-single-digit core revenue growth and greater than 30% growth in free cash flow. With the closing of ASP at beginning of second quarter, we also took another significant step forward in the ongoing transformation of the Fortive portfolio, greatly increasing our exposure to an attractive healthcare market, tied to long-term secular growth drivers and adding another source of high recurring revenue and consistently robust free cash flow.","Looking ahead with a combination of a resilient core portfolio, the foundation of the Fortive Business System, and growing contribution of Gordian and Accruent and the addition of ASP, we've remained well positioned to deliver another year of top quartile earnings growth. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in New York on May 16th, where we will give you deeper insights into the digital strategy of Fortive as well as an update on our portfolio transformation efforts. ","With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin.","Griffin Whitney","Thanks Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Erica, we are now ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Steve Tusa.","Steve Tusa ","On the revenue contribution from acquisitions for Gordian and Accruent, I think the amount I guess is something like on a pro rata basis like $100 million a quarter, the acquisition contribution in that segment was like $80 million I think or somewhat that, I mean is there seasonality to that business or I\u2019m doing the math wrong?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes. No, you are not doing the math wrong. There is a seasonality to Gordian and Accruent, it's a little bit different than what our traditional or core business has been where we think maybe we get 20% and 45% in the first two quarters of the year and I think that it's going to have like maybe a 40% to 60% rate in first half to second half. ","Steve Tusa ","Okay. And any -- on Gordian, is there any market dynamics there that are moving around relative to expectations? ","James Lico","No, in fact we had a good quarter at both, Steve, it\u2019s Jim. We saw good strength in the construction spend through the platform. That's the job order contracting part of the business and what we call procurement solutions. That business was up double-digits. So -- and that\u2019s roughly 60% of the business. So, no, at Gordian we saw good performance and we saw a good performance at Accruent as well. So as we said in the prepared remarks we're off to a very good start and I think one of the things we like the best about the business in addition to its secular drivers is we are really getting an outstanding team in both businesses. ","Steve Tusa ","Okay. And then one last one for you. Just from a macro perspective, and now that you kind of hand an opportunity to draw the first quarter here looking back, was there any sort of pull in or pre-buy in the fourth quarter in any of your products and maybe just touch high level on what you are seeing in the macro out there? It seems like there are a lot of different businesses moving around on you, some negative, some positive, relatively inconsistent performance I\u2019d say. Is there anything out on the macro that kind of worries you for the second half?","James Lico","Yes. So maybe sort of a little bit of the geographies in context Steve. I think what we saw in -- our overall North American growth was pretty good but obviously Gilbarco drives a lot of that because of the quarter they had. I think the good news in the quarter Gilbarco was really the high growth markets, now those specific to Gilbarco, so I don\u2019t know if you get a macro read there as much, but good high growth market performance pretty much in every part of the world, a lot of that we said in the prepared remarks. What we did see is relative to you are pull in question or what we saw is we definitely -- I think we highlighted this is February that we thought there was somewhere around 70 to a 100 basis points of revenue in the fourth quarter that was probably came out of the first. We now think that number is closer to a 125 and that's a chunk of tariff avoidance and then I think the other thing is we definitely saw North America in a number of places sort of start-out slow and then get better through the quarter at point-of-sale Fluke as an example clearly got better through the quarter, Matco got better in March. So we did see some trends that were improving through the quarter, and I would say just in our distribution businesses mostly weaker in Professional Instrumentation clearly Europe was a weak point for our distribution in Europe.","Operator","And your next question comes from Scott Davis.","Scott Davis","Just I don't think I\u2019ve ever asked a question on Sensing Technologies business at all. But what -- does that business turn around 2019 or are we now kind of open for 2020?","James Lico","No, well, it\u2019s probably going to be a little -- we always thought it was a low single-digit in the year and that changed -- that point of view doesn't really change, a little bit different number but probably the lower part of low single-digit. They were negative in the quarter, but will continue to get a little bit better as -- and their comps get a little easier in the second half as well.","One of the good things about the business is they've been obviously a very profitable part of the business and they did a good job in protecting free cash flow in the quarter. So, they'll move the growth here for the rest of the year and they'll continue to contribute better from an earnings perspective as they go to through the year.","Scott Davis","Okay. And if I just look at Slide 4, and you just take a look at the R&D numbers as a percent revenues, you bought a lot of businesses, spend a lot of money R&D. And Jim what's your early take on if you\u2019re getting your bank for your buck on that spend, or is there any way to get any efficiency on it or productivity and I know it's tough to scale it because they're very different companies that you own but just to look how that may be on R&D?","James Lico","Yes. I think a couple of things. One, clearly the software businesses like Gordian and Accruent are going to require a little bit more R&D. Quite frankly, they were pretty tight on R&D being owned -- both being owned by private equity. We will probably add to their R&D spend as we look forward to opportunities to accelerate growth and to build out their platform of solutions. As you know, the great addition of these businesses, the continued additive features to current customers, which really delivers strong earnings potential over time.","So we'll do that. But in many standpoint, the overall Fortive number may not move all that much because as we will look for productivity -- as we\u2019re always looking for productivity in other places, we're through some of the big spend at Tektronix on their new platform as an example. So, there is clearly what we often call it dynamic resource allocation where we're really moving money into places where we have the highest growth opportunities.","Operator","And your next question comes from Julian Mitchell.","Julian Mitchell","Just looking at slides 8 and 9, if we just look at the core revenue growth contribution to EPS, you did about $0.05 or you're expecting to do about $0.05 in the first half, the year you\u2019ve guided at about $0.25, so a big sort of step up in that contribution from first half to second half. Maybe just walk through some of the biggest moving parts in terms of that step up please?","James Lico","Well. I think the bigger thing is just as we move through the quarter, our volume steps up sequentially. We normally -- I think from Q1 to Q2, our revenues are going to go up by 20%. Obviously, our expenses don't -- the fix expenses don't see that piece. So, that creates a normal step up through the year. We generally think of our earnings growth, the EPS being contributive 20 in the first quarter, 25 in the second and third and 30 in the fourth quarter. And so that -- when you do that, it gives you this profile. And so I think that that's most of it -- the other thing -- last thing I\u2019d point out is there's FX in the first half, it\u2019s particularly I think there's $0.03 in Q2 or Q1 and then $0.01 or $0.02 in Q2, and then it really flattens out in the back half. So those are some of the dynamics that\u2019s giving a little bit of a backend of a ramp through the year, but it's most of the revenue ramp.","Julian Mitchell","Understood, thanks. And then my second question maybe around Professional Instruments specifically. You talked about the sensing assumptions there. Any color maybe on what you're seeing on the order intake in Fluke and Tektronix, how quickly you think those accelerate maybe in the rest of the year? And whether you thought you suffered from much destocking in the distribution facing businesses in PI in Q1? ","James Lico","Yes, I'll pick a last part first, Julian. We definitely think we saw destocking in some places at Fluke and Tek I would say definitely in Europe for both businesses and certainly some in the US. Tek had an interesting dynamic where their direct business was up significantly more either had like mid-single growth in the direct business, but their distribution business was down in the first quarter. So that really kind of -- we attribute a chunk of that to destocking, and a little bit of what we said before, which was kind of tariff avoidance, pricing avoidance that occurred in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned in answer a few minutes ago. So I think that provides a dynamic where we'll see that play out and improve the second quarter and through the rest of the year. ","I would also point out that Tek had a book-to-bill over 1 in the first quarter. I think Fluke did as well but -- so we certainly feel like we're seeing some solid performance. And I think in both cases, we're starting to see the point-of-sale number start to improve as we move through the quarter. So I think we started off a little slower than we thought. Obviously, Professional Instrumentation at just under 2% core growth certainly reflects that Tek being flat certainly reflects that. But we think we're not really expecting a big macro improvement here to deliver what we need to deliver. It's really more just kind of working through that inventory destocking and really just kind of seeing the current rate sort of play out.","Operator","And your next question comes from Deane Dray.","Deane Dray","Hey. Could you take us through the Tektronix video transaction, what are the economics, what's the opportunity here?","James Lico","Yes, the -- strategically Deane you know as well. So, we've always been looking from a portfolio perspective to always put our businesses in the best position for success. We also help our operating companies to do that as well. And I think that Tektronix team really came back with this understanding that by combining with the Telestream business, the video business not as core to what we do at Tek obviously. And increasingly, I think the combination of those businesses was looking better and better. ","So we'll combine the businesses, we'll have a minority interest in the combined entity and we'll really benefit from the success of the synergies in the business and what Genstar is looking to do with the business over time. So we think the economics over time are going to be good because we think the synergies are strong.","Deane Dray","And then on the 160 basis points of price, how does that spread across the businesses, where did you get the most pricing and was there any give-up?","Charles McLaughlin","Hey, Deane, it\u2019s Chuck. So for the most part we got price across all of our company -- operating companies. A little bit more -- we were a little more successful in IT where it starts with the two rather than one and we were a little bit lighter on the Professional Instrumentation side at 80 basis points. So -- but we -- I think we were successful across most places. We struggled at one -- a couple of places where we are struggled on price for some very specific reasons. At Tek they were down 50 basis points which is not what we were expecting and we're going to work to regain that but was a little bit different and also at EMC but unrelated to -- they have some contractual things that was mostly known about coming in, everywhere else, we\u2019re really happy with 160 basis points in total, where we normally would get 40 or 50.","Deane Dray","And just on Tek on the pricing, was that give up on the direct side or through distribution?","Charles McLaughlin","Probably more on the direct side as those are more -- as you can imagine those are more case-by-case decisions on the business. And so I would say at least more to the direct side. A little bit in distribution but some of it was quite not realized on the distribution side because of -- to think about it this way, we expected more price with January 1 price increases but because we had more pull into the fourth quarter from distribution, and we sort of -- that we sort of avoided the price metric if you will in the first quarter, if that makes sense Deane. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Obin. ","Andrew Obin ","Just a question on Professional Instrumentation margins, they sort of have been negative for a couple of quarters now, what would it take operationally for the margins to inflect back up? ","Charles McLaughlin","Great question. There is a couple of things. One is, they've been struggling for a couple quarters. Remember if tariffs are really a big impact to both Fluke and Tek. And so for Professional Instrumentation that really get's hammered there pretty well. So we will lap those tariffs that are in the majority of them in Q3. So we will start to get a lift there. Also Professional Instrumentation has high fall-through on their -- on shipments and so we need that pull in or that avoidance that maybe some of their distributors went for. We just need to get more volume out the door and get back growth. So that hurt us in Q1, so that\u2019ll start to moderate. And one other factor is FX has really hurt us a little bit more than we expected and the fall-through on those things and again we're going to start when we get into the second half we should lap those as well. So if FX stays here there is some -- there is less impact in Q2 than Q1, but when we get to Q3 most of those should go away. So I would expect that we will see -- we will be back to normal margin expansion in the second half of this year. ","James Lico","Andrew, the other thing that it\u2019s just maybe important to keep an eye on is we had our best in the history of the company last first quarter of '18 on margin expansion in PI, we had 300 basis points is margin in the first quarter last year. So when we look on a two year stack there, we still feel pretty good about the margin expansion in the core business. Obviously the tariffs as Chuck mentioned have some impact there. But I think when we look at sort of the core work that we typically do, we feel pretty good about that and that will get better as we work through the year.","Andrew Obin ","And just a follow-up question on growth, so Q1 core growth was 3.7 I think in the second quarter we're guiding 3 to 4. For the year, the range is still future 3 to 5. So what would it take for you guys to hit the 5% organic core growth for the year with acceleration in the second half particularly as the comps get tougher in the second half? Thanks.","Charles McLaughlin","Yes. No problem. So I think first of all, we probably want to see Western Europe get better, China to continue, we were high single-digit in the month during the quarter. We've said for a while now that China was likely to be more mid-single-digit for the years. So if China held in there, may be got a little better and Western Europe got better, I think we'll more be at the high-end of the range. And also -- we also have some easier comps in some place like in Sensing and at Fluke. So if we get to the higher end of their businesses as well, there's some opportunity. So we will build the business model around that range and what we feel really good about is we're going to deliver double-digit earnings growth in the first half, 3% growth and we're going to deliver high-teens earnings growth through the year. So, even in that range of growth rates but I think the earnings growth is going to be substantial. And that\u2019s pretty much like the strong free cash flow in the quarter, despite the fact that we missed you know the PI revenue number by a little bit, the free cash flow up 31% I think was a good testament of our operational ability to continue to deliver.","Operator","And your next question is from Richard Eastman.","Richard Eastman","Jim or Chuck, could you just speak to the video that you\u2019re contributing -- Tek\u2019s video business that you are contributing to this venture, what revenue did it have? What kind of profits? And just, when do you expect that to be completed?","James Lico","So I'll take the second part first. We expect to be completed early in the third quarter is what we're looking at and the business in terms of size is $55 million or $60 million in revenue, for us it probably around 18% to 20% operating profit.","Richard Eastman","Okay. So pretty decent. And then I just have a question on the EPS guide for the second quarter. I'm a little bit curious, I would've thought so $0.86 to $0.90 I'm kind of referencing your 25%. So I guess Chuck, a 25% so I guess $0.90 kind of fits but I would think with the ASP acquisition I mean shouldn't that add approximately a nickel to the quarter? It sounds like this video business sort of come out till Q3. So what's the drag there on the EPS for the second quarter?","Charles McLaughlin","Actually I think there's only two things that you might be missing, I agree with the nickel on ASP. If you look at our core business without the benefit of Gordian and Accruent ASP and FX you get a number that\u2019s around for the quarter 25% to $0.80. You've buildup of $0.05 ASP as you noted and there is I think we've got $0.06 in for Gordian and Accruent. And so that fits in. Probably one thing is there's still $0.02 to $0.02 of tailwind on FX.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Very good. Thank you. ","Charles McLaughlin","I just want to make sure I called that headwind. ","Richard Eastman","The headwind, yes, yes, understood.","Charles McLaughlin","All coming up 18% earnings per share growth. ","Operator","And your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz.","Andrew Kaplowitz","For Chuck, SG&A was up 450 basis points over 30% of sales, it\u2019s not really surprising, it's a lighter quarter in sales and given the acquisition related activity you\u2019ve had but is it up simply because of that and would you expect just to come down now versus relatively and seasonally high Q1?","Charles McLaughlin","So if you're just talking about the total SG&A, actually it's up quite a bit because of the amortization and also the purchase accounting related to the deals and the deal costs. That's actually the main step up there.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Nothing unusual on there other than just the increased M&A activity, correct?","Charles McLaughlin","There's a little bit with Gordian and Accruent where they've got really high gross margins, and so they're above the fleet average. But the first two things I talked about is 90% of them.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And then Jim just focusing on China for a second, you mentioned last quarter that you're seeing some slowing in Tek order book in China, but doesn't look like you saw any real slowdown in that business. So when you focus on China, I mean you mentioned maybe it can be resilient here as a lot of that resilient in GVR, Tek actually outperformed in China and then what's going on in the rest of Asia, because you mentioned that looks up creating a little weak? ","James Lico","Yes. So on Tek specifically, we saw -- as you said, we saw a little bit better China than we thought. I think some of that -- we still expected that to moderate a little bit as I said, it's high-single-digits in the quarter but probably mid-single in the full year. So I think that's still going to be a good year after, I think four years in a row of either double-digit or high-single-digit growth for Tek in China. ","And it's been relatively resilient as you said, I think we saw most customers in most segments of the market pretty good. And the other thing I would call and just relative to China macro is that Fluke's point-of-sale in its shops, which is a pretty good bellwether for the market was good, and Fluke's growth was pretty broad based in China as well. ","So I think China is holding in there. I wouldn't -- I'm not going to be appending to say that everything's great and it's going to turn wonderful, but I think it's it was certainly solid, and our -- it was a little better than we thought it would be overall. And as you mentioned GVR\u2019s continued regulatory performance, but that'll wane a little bit in the second half.","Relative to Tek in the rest of Asia, very -- a lot of our business in South Korea is 3D sensing related and it\u2019s field related, we probably have more semiconductor process if you will or manufacturing exposure in Korea. And so while that's not a big issue for Fortive, it does impact the Asia business as we sight it and so we saw that in Korea and in other parts of Asia. So, that was probably the -- one of the headwinds that we saw at Tektronix in the quarter for sure. ","That moderates a little bit through the year just because we have some easier comps.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague.","Jeffrey Sprague","Maybe just for me on ASP. Just curious how the business performed during this carve out period, I think the 2017 revenues were $775 million or so. What\u2019s the revenue base here as it enters the Fortive empire? ","Charles McLaughlin","Probably about 825 million, 820 million, somewhere around there. ","Jeffrey Sprague","And are you -- so that sounds like net 5% growth or so, may be a little bit more than that, is that? ","Charles McLaughlin","Mid-single-digit in '18 so. ","Jeffrey Sprague","And is that basically what's implicit in the guide and for the year here or is that going to be organic obviously for you this year but did you see that type of growth continuing over the balance of \u201818?","Charles McLaughlin","We\u2019d probably be in the low to mid range right now. I think we\u2019re still getting a sense of what the business can be like, there are a couple of one-time things that were last year that I would say maybe their natural growth rate over the last few years has been low single-digit in that range, kind of 3 to 4. But we think we know the market is growing mid-single-digit. So I think as we said a year ago when we announced the signing of the deal that we felt good about over a time period we could turn the business into a mid-single-digit grower. But I think it's implicit in the guide with about 12 months of TSAs Jeff and working through Johnson & Johnson and some of the revenue profile for a time period, it's probably going to be a more or like low single-digit. And so we've got every aspect of the under our ownership. ","Jeffrey Sprague","And I think also there was -- obviously had to do a lot of prep work to kind of accept the carve-out in the year on the price. But I think after ownership you\u2019re looking at some pretty heavy work on their metrics management structure and alike. Is that still in front of you, is that embedded in the guide or is that something that I don\u2019t know maybe gets capitalized in acquisition accounting or something?","Charles McLaughlin","No I think if you're talking about and the standing up the -- the team is going to run this. I think that we've done quite a bit of that. I think the thing that's in front of us really is basically outside of the US we've got these TSAs that we're going to have to bring them under into our IT platform and that's going to go on for probably four quarters. And as we do your profitably will accelerate every time we move off of one of those. ","James Lico","I think everything that we we've seen thus far, we've done a lot of work in this regard Jeff is that the cost structure that led to the returns for the business is every bit in play. So we feel very good about that. We think we still believe in the opportunity to improve the gross margins as well. And then finally when you look at the -- so we -- a lot of the tenants of -- the core tenants of the value creation there and we did this at a much lower interest rate cost and at a much different tax rate and so the returns -- the return profile has improved pretty a great deal since we announced the deal 12 months ago -- 10 months ago. ","Operator","And your next question is from John Inch.","John Inch","Can you talk to the convertible senior notes you've just issued, seems to have been done at very favorable terms. I'm not sure if that incrementally additive even by a penny or two to sort of the thought process that you have. And I was wondering about just the balance sheet in general given if you can do that with that tranche, are there other things you could perhaps be doing or thought process around the balance sheet or is pretty well locked in? ","James Lico","Well, I think in terms of the guide -- first thank you, we\u2019d like the deal with the convertible notes. But as we came out this year, while we didn't know the exact terms of that, we had most of that factored in when we set the original guide. So it's not accretive to the guide but we like the deal that we did.","Are there other things around the balance sheet? It isn\u2019t just because on this one is a convertible note, I mean it is treated as debt not equity. And so I don't think it gives us any more debt financing for M&A around that. But are other things around the balance sheet? There is -- we're continuing to look and see what our optionality is and as we said for a while we'll consider what the best fit at the time is for financing and raising capital.","John Inch","But it sounds like it\u2019s going to be tied to probably future M&A. It sort of brings up the question, Jim, how are you thinking at this stage in late April about no additional portfolio moves in 2019? And you guys have done a ton over the couple of years, probably a lot of digestion work I'm assuming but you obviously want to be opportunistic. Is there an early read in terms of how are you thinking about these opportunities today or are you intend to sort of sit back and wait?","James Lico","Yes. I would rarely be described as someone who sits back and waits on anything. So I feel obligated to that as we're certainly leaning in to opportunities. John, we have been pretty busy. I think we have been as busy as we have been over a time period. So we will continue to look for opportunities. As you said, we just closed 24 days ago the largest acquisition in history of the company, and so we certainly are digesting that and spending a considerable amount of time to make sure we do that right and that's important.","So, I don't want in any way shape and form suggest that that's not a first priority because it is. But we also want to make sure we just between Gordian and Accruent and also with ASP we have not bought, call it, almost $10 billion of served market opportunity and with that comes more opportunity.","So, we feel good about the opportunities in front of us, but again I think we now have the -- we certainly have the ability to be disciplined like we always have been and we will return focus as well. Almost sun-setting our three year anniversary here pretty soon. As you know well, the deals have ebbed and flowed and I suspect that will continue to be true.","Operator","And your next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski ","Joshua Pokrzywinski ","So, just let me follow up on Gordian and Accruent, you had them under your belt for a while now and I think obviously some differentiated assets in the software space, but it seems like every company out there is coming out with kind of a software add on for everything they're doing and obviously the big software guys are still everywhere. When you think about your total software exposure, including those to iNet, eMaint, you\u2019re kind of putting all in one big basket, how would you characterize the competitive landscape? Are you seeing more folks show up? Do you feel like the niches are well protected and how does that make you feel about kind of more activity in those spaces?","James Lico","Well, I would say that the environment hasn't changed a lot in the last several months, but certainly for the last few years it\u2019s been competitive in the sense of the two major deals that we've done were in private equity hands and private equity showing up increasingly in a lot of these transactions. So I would say I wouldn't necessarily say we want to play where we're advantaged, where we have a proprietary view of the business, where -- and certainly now with some of the additions where we have synergy. And so I think those -- we're going to play in places where I think we're more likely to win. But I think the most important part is first having a strategic view of how to build a workflow and to really understand what you can do with the business, not only with the business you have but also with additional things and building more scale. ","And as you point out now, with Gordian and Accruent, eMaint alone and sort of that facilities maintenance -- facilities management software space, we're almost at a $0.5 billion. That gives us a tremendous amount of scale in which to do things. And then in some of our other businesses, where we have strategic positions, we're adding on to things to make them -- just make the workflow more competitive. And that builds on the strength of the brands whether it be Gilbarco or Tektronix or whatever. So, we're continuing to do those things as well. ","And I would say the other thing I would say is that while maybe the follow up question might be pricing, I don't think we're -- for great assets, I don't think we're really seeing differences in pricing over the last year or two. I think the crummy assets maybe have prices decreased. And so everything in the bottom end has moved up. But I think when you look at what great growth, great margin profiles with good high recurring revenue, those really strong assets with differentiated market positions, fundamentally, that pricing really hasn't changed in the last year or two.","Joshua Pokrzywinski ","That\u2019s helpful Jim. And then just one, shifting gears a little bit, thinking about the second half, or even maybe beyond the second half, at some point before too long you're going to run into some pretty tough comps on GVR and I think orchestrating the handoff between that business and some of the PI stuff where it's just kind of the higher quality businesses over time are the ones that are getting more of the focus. Do you anticipate that being a smooth handoff i.e. some of the headwinds today or end market shuffling today, times itself to where it goes away by the time GVR has tougher comps?","James Lico","Yes. So I think Chuck can talk in a little bit. I think, strategically we're certainly looking within Gilbarco within transportation tech and within Fortive to countermeasure these things. So, within Gilbarco, we're building out our high growth market positions. We've done two -- really almost three acquisitions over the last several years, in India as an example, to build our positions in high growth markets. We just launched a new dispenser for high growth markets. That's I think, a really great product. So build out our positions in markets where we're -- that are non-EMV, that's number one. I think number two is to continue to take advantage of opportunities, like in electric vehicles, where our Tritium investment is doing some things and we'll certainly continue to do that. So that's what we're doing within Gilbarco. And then certainly in the platform, we're looking for new opportunities. And certainly, as you mentioned, the breadth of opportunities that we have throughout Fortive to also do these things, are going to be all opportunities for us to countermeasure, if you will, the EMV shortfall, which inevitably will happen. I think, I don't think I think we've been consistent well over for at least couple of years to say that inevitably, there will be a step down at some point in time that\u2019s I would say somewhat predictable, probably not within a specific quarter but certainly within a couple of quarters we have a pretty good sense for that. ","Charles McLaughlin","Yes, Josh, if I could add on it, if you want to size that when you start looking at in '20, beyond 2021, 2022 and 2023 is probably $100 million to $200 million step down over a quarter period which is probably about $0.10 to $0.20 and if you think about $0.10 a year I think we can handle that in terms of an earnings power. Also worth it is noting 1.7 billion of acquired assets growing at high single-digits is also part of and given mentioned some of those in the GVR platform. ","Operator","And your next questing is from Scott Graham.","Scott Graham","I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what the PI impact from acquisitions, it looks like on a full-year basis it was minus 410 this quarter, what does that look like on a full year basis?","James Lico","Are you talking about on the SG&A there or on the\u2026","Scott Graham","I'm talking about on your exhibit on Page 6, the operating margin on bundle. ","James Lico","I see. I have to think about that, and I prefer to not to just pitfall here because we got the ASP coming in here with its amortization but it's likely to be in the same size as what we just saw with Gordian and Accruent for the full-year, if you think about $2.8 billion spent on Gordian and Accruent and $2.7 billion on ASP. It's going to look about the similar impact on our total operating margins. But I think that anyways that's what is that's what I would expect to see. ","Scott Graham","And so when you are talking earlier about the upward inflection in the PI margin you were just talking about the core?","James Lico","Yes, that's right, for sure. ","Scott Graham","I also notice that when you talked about OMX not only did that number come down from plus 50 to plus 25 to 50 on a full year basis, where you talked a lot about mix, I was hoping if you could tell us a little bit more maybe size that for us what is that 30, 40, is that 25 basis points of takedown, what happened with OMX both the guidance and what's going on with the mix within that?","James Lico","Well most of what happened with the guide for the year is the first quarter and so our first quarter had negative 70 it didn\u2019t make the second half go up anymore and it's really not much more complicated than that. I do think that we will see sequential improvement from Q1 to probably flat, a little bit positive to back to normal because the big headwinds of that we called out in order of mix and tariffs and FX are really a first half problem and they normalize into the second half. And we\u2019re very focused on continuing to countermeasure all those things. So I think the idea that I think Chuck and I have spent a considerable amount of time making sure that we've got the actions in the businesses to go after this and that's why that even though you see a little bit of a lower OMX you see the continued strength in EPS and you see the continued strength in free cash flow. So the metric itself it's a little bit influenced by the way you measure tariffs and things like that. But at the end of the day what we don\u2019t change is you see the incredibly strong high-teens EPS growth and a continued focus on 120% free cash flow conversion. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Nigel Coe.","Nigel Coe","So we covered a lot of ground. But I do want to go back to Gordian and Accruent and they\u2019d be rolled into core in 4Q. So may be just speak to how those performed in 1Q core on a like-for-like basis? How did they hold up in the current environment? And then the second part on that is just stripping out -- kind of to do the math on EBITDA margins, by the way the additional disclosure is great. It looks like the margin came in at about 23% to 24% for Gordian and Accruent. Is that math correct as we're working with low 30s for those two companies?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes. You\u2019re talking about the EBITDA for Gordian and Accruent? This is what you said?","Nigel Coe","That's right.","James Lico","I think for this year, yes, it starts probably a little under that but not much and ramps through the year. So yes, that's correct.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then the like-for-like growth \u2026","James Lico","Nigel, your first question was I think around durability of Gordian and Accruent, is that?","Nigel Coe","No, no. It's really more about how they performed in the quarter, Jim.","James Lico","Got it. Got it. And I would also say just to that point is and may be just it's a small but important caveat we've spend a bunch of time with the businesses and we may choose to invest in the business through the year and in fact for sure we have had already approved some additional investments to accelerate the growth in the business too which may not necessary pay out in any particular quarter, but gives us a much more durable revenue stream in the years to come. So, you know us, you know from time-to-make we will make those decisions and that could impact that percentage by a few hundred basis points on when and how we do it.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And the growth check, what was the growth at Gordian and Accruent?","Charles McLaughlin","High single-digit in Q1 and that's what we expected, that's what we're seeing and we expect that as that comes into Q4 this year it's probably 30 point lift to our core growth.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Great. And then quickly on ASP accretion. The saving of the accretion, looks like a nickle in 2Q, obviously like a $0.07 to $0.09 in 3Q, 4Q. Is that the TSA's roll off you alluded to, is that contributing to the better accretion in the back half of the year? And are we still looking at $0.30, $0.35 for the first 12 months?","Charles McLaughlin","So, $0.30, $0.35 for first 12, that's still the range. And yes, for the most part and while it's stepping up as it goes through time, there is also a little bit seasonality, it\u2019s like many businesses the fourth quarters can be stronger than the first and what not. But I think those are major levers.","Operator","And your next question comes from the John Walsh.","John Walsh","A lot of ground covered so just a quick one here. Just looking at the language in your press release around the headwinds on Professional Instrumentation, just wanted to make sure I understood clearly, I mean, that's really a way to call out what you were talking about with the distribution channel or is there anything else that that language alludes to I guess?","James Lico","No. It\u2019s really kind of in our short cycle businesses primarily it\u2019s Fluke and Tek. They\u2019d probably greater fourth quarter than we originally expected, which led to some -- and we will call most of that probably tariff avoidance. So there is a little bit of point-of-sale starting slower too in the first part of the quarter as well John. So, I think it's those two things. The destocking some of it is because of the point-of-sale, it's also some of the because of the increase in inventory that they had at the end of the year.","John Walsh","Okay, great. And then I guess I'm looking at the Q you guys call out Germany as a country. Obviously, there's been a lot of concerns around Germany, given what we've seen from some of the macro data there, your sales are actually down very modestly. Maybe just help us understand really what drives your business there and maybe even broaden it out to Europe, because actually thought the European performance was a little bit better given some of the macros there? ","James Lico","Yes, I think, as we said, I would -- I'm still -- I still think Europe is a challenge for us. So, in the quarter Qualitrol and GVR which -- Qualitrol was one -- was a project, GVR was more secular, typically not a good read on the macro. That's a broader Europe comment, John. When you look at, Tek was down in Europe and a chunk of that was in Germany. Fluke had a weaker, but they weren't down in Europe, they were weaker than normal. So I think those are maybe a little bit more of a telltale sign of the macro. And so we don't have a big belief that that's going to significantly improve. For the rest of the year we'll sunset some easier comps, but I think we're watching. We're reading a lot of the same macro stuff. Everyone's reading. We're certainly looking through a lot of the other peer company filings to get a read on that. And I think it seems like it kind of depends. ","So, the good news is like some of our software businesses have been pretty resilient. I think Accruent was up high-single-digits in Europe as an example. So the places where we have good resiliency within the business model are still doing pretty well.","Operator","And your last question comes from Joe Giordano.","Joseph Giordano","So Chuck could you give the specific number for Fluke, like I think you said Fluke Digital the growth was in the quarter and did you give like the legacy Fluke growth in the quarter?","Charles McLaughlin","I don't believe I did. Total Fluke was low-single-digits, yes. ","Joseph Giordano","Low-single-digit, okay. And was there a management changes going on there this quarter? ","James Lico","Yes. So I think we were introducing -- but we did -- we announced a couple of changes. We put in many of our senior leaders have been sort of owner operators and businesses since our inception. We've hired somebody from the outside that was in immersion for a while, and put him -- Marc Tremblay into the Fluke job and we promoted Tami Newcombe into the Tektronix job. So those two organizational announcements have been out there and we're really excited about having two really strong leaders in the new positions also Pat and [West] obviously picked up a lot with all the new acquisitions. Pat certainly has been the lead role in ASP. So gives us the opportunity for the two of them to spend more time on building out the platforms and that kind of thing.","Joseph Giordano","And then what the -- I just want to make sure on the build up here for Gordian and Accruent, if I am getting the math right. So I think it's $0.06 in 2Q with the expectations. Was it something like four in the first quarter here?","Charles McLaughlin","I think we're saying $0.05. ","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And then, we're having that into core in 4Q right, so the incremental on top of that in your full year, that's just in from the third quarter, right?","Charles McLaughlin","Yes. It\u2019s in core in the fourth quarter. ","James Lico","So I think that\u2019s it. Thanks, everybody, for a great interaction and the time today. Obviously a busy day for everyone and so we appreciate the time you've taken to be with us. We are really proud of the work we did in the quarter. Certainly some things affect. But as I think mentioned we\u2019re very focused on that, but at the same time the ability to sort of do what we believe is going to be a strong year. We\u2019re off to a good start. We look forward to seeing all of you in New York in May and we will give you more detail on ASP, on Gordian or Accruent. We will certainly outline our digital strategy and certainly give you a better perspective on a number of the strategies that we are utilizing to drive growth this year, but more importantly to build a better Fortive over time. Thanks and Griffin and team and Chuck are around for questions tonight, tomorrow and next week. Take care, everybody. Have a great week. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
