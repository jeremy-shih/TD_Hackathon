At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Katie. And thanks everyone for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings announcement. As Katie just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter.","Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. David will then provide our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014 and then we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursement or net revenues.","Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call including our business outlook are forward-looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. As a reminder, in Q3 of last year, our results included benefits from a reduction in reorganization liabilities.","We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC. And thanks everyone for joining us today.","We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter. We generated strong revenue growth and earnings per share, grew operating income, returned substantial cash to our shareholders and delivered another quarter of very strong year bookings. Here are a few highlights.","New bookings were $8.8 billion, bringing us to $27.6 billion for the first three quarters of the year. We generated revenues of $7.7 billion, a 7% increase and above our guiding range. We delivered earnings per share of $1.26, up 11% from adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year. Operating margin was 15.2%, consistent with the third quarter last year.","We generated solid free cash flow and our balance sheet remains very strong and in the quarter with a cash balance of $4 billion and we returned approximately $1.1 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","With Q3 behind us, the second half of the year is shaping up as expected with stronger revenue growth and we are well positioned to continue the momentum into the first quarter.","Now let me hand over to David, who will review the numbers for the quarter in greater detail. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre and thanks all of you for joining us today.","As I review the results on this morning's call, you'll see that we delivered very good results in the third quarter, highlighted by a significant uptick in net revenues with growth of 7% in local currency.","Net revenues were higher than expected, well above the top end of our guidance range and driven by improved growth rates across essentially every dimension of our business, meaning the majority of our operating groups, the three geographic regions and in both consulting and outsourcing.","The higher revenue growth was underpinned by yet another strong new bookings quarter, which is indicative of the high degree of relevance our offerings and capabilities have in the marketplace. We delivered double-digit EPS growth and while our focus on pricing and overall cost efficiency is ongoing, our third quarter reflects progress with the challenges highlighted last quarter.","We generated strong cash flow and of course we continue to return a substantial portion of cash to shareholders. So we're very pleased with the quarter.","With that, let's get to the numbers starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were strong at $8.8 billion. Consulting bookings were $4.3 billion with a book-to-bill of $1.1 billion. Outsourcing bookings were $4.5 billion with a book-to-bill of $1.2 billion. Year-to-date bookings were $27.6 billion, reflecting 12% growth in local currency.","Taking a closer look at our new bookings, there are several additional points that are worth noting. Coming off the record bookings last quarter, consulting bookings continue to reflect healthy demand for both systems integration and technology consulting.","Additionally, management consulting bookings were solid and within our target book-to-bill range. We were also pleased with another quarter of solid outsourcing bookings, which included an uptick in technology outsourcing from the second quarter, driven by higher demand for application outsourcing.","Strong demand for our BPO services continued, driven by finance and accounting and procurement offerings, even after the extremely strong record BPO bookings we had in quarter two.","From an operating group perspective, CMT and products were key drivers of our strong bookings performance, which positions both for continued strong growth rates.","Finally, we continue to be the partner of choice on complex transformational projects with seven clients with bookings in excess of $100 million.","Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.7 billion, an increase of 7% in U.S. dollars and local currency, reflecting a flat FX impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in March. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.1 billion, up 6% in USD and 5% in local currency.","Outsourcing revenues were $3.6 billion, up 10% in USD and 9% in local currency. Again, revenues came in even higher than expected, driven by strong performance in H&PS, products and CMT. So let me give you some additional highlights from the operating group this quarter.","H&PS grew 11%, delivering the significant improvement in growth we had signaled in quarter two. Growth rates improved across all three geographic regions, but a strong uptick in the Americas was the primary driver in the quarter.","Within the Americas, our health business and public service was very strong including the recent acquisition of ASM Research, which expands our capabilities within the military and federal health businesses. And within our state and local practice, both our human services eligibility and ERP offerings made a strong contribution.","In products, the 10% growth demonstrated a continuation of broad-based demand with strong growth in both the Americas and EMEA. We saw good demand for BPO, specifically for our procurement offerings.","Overall, our clients are focused on four main themes, the digital customer, efficiency in cost optimization, industry specific solutions and advancing the technology agenda, including new technologies, extending ERP and network optimization.","Communications, media and technology growth was 7%. In an overall environment, it continues to be in a cycle of rapid change. CMT's growth was primarily driven by very strong performance in the Americas and we continue to be very pleased with our performance in electronics and high tech.","The revenue growth also reflects the ramp-up of several of the large transformational deals that we signed in recent quarters. More broadly, we continue to focus on extending our footprint in E&HT, working with our communications clients to drive their cost optimization agenda and increasing our penetration in certain areas such as media and entertainment, cable and social media and internet.","Financial services grew 5% consistent with last quarter. We're particularly pleased with the significant growth in banking and capital markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Americas growth was negatively impacted by a slowdown in a few clients as large scale transformation programs are going through their natural cycle as well as reduced demand in our mortgage business.","Overall we see good opportunities in the FS market, driven by our client's focus on cost efficiency, which resulted in strong demand for our BPO offerings and also driven by risk in regulatory and increased investments in digital, primarily in distribution and marketing.","As expected, we saw moderate improvement in resources with 2% growth. Energy continues to generate strong growth globally, but we did see some moderation from previous quarters, particularly in North America.","While we are pleased with the modern improvement in the quarter, we still have work to do to position the business for sustained positive growth and North America and natural resources globally continue to be our most challenged markets.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.8% compared with 33.9% for the same period last year, down 110 basis points.","Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.6% of net revenue compared with 12.3% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 70 basis points.","General administrative expense was 5.9% of net revenues compared with 6.4% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 50 basis points.","As a reminder, in quarter three of last year, we had a reduction in the reorganization liabilities that impacted certain metrics. The following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results.","Operating income was $1.2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.2% operating margin, roughly equal to the adjusted operating margin for the same period last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% compared with an adjusted tax rate of 24.8% for the third quarter last year.","Net income was $882 million for the third quarter compared with adjusted net income of $824 million for the same quarter last year. And diluted earnings per share were $1.26, compared with the adjusted EPS of $1.14 in the third quarter last year, an increase of $0.12.","Turning to DSOs, our day services outstanding continue to be industry leading. They were 35 days, up from 33 days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $85 million.","Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $4 billion, compared with $5.6 billion at August 31 last year. The current level reflects the cash returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends as well as the acquisitions we've made year-to-date.","Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of more than 293,000 people and we now have approximately 194,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter three, our utilization was 88%, up from last quarter and consistent with quarter three last year.","Our attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations was 14%, up 2% from both quarter two in the same period last year and lastly, we now expect that at least 65,000 people will join our company in fiscal 2014.","So turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter we repurchased or redeemed approximately 5.5 million shares for $441 million at an average price of $80.13 per share. Year to date we purchased 24.4 million shares for $1.9 billion at an average price of $77.90 per share. At May 31, we had approximately 5.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","Finally as Pierre mentioned, on May 15, 2014, we made our second semi-annual dividend payment for fiscal 2014 in the amount of $0.93 per share, brining total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.3 billion.","So in summary, quarter three was an important quarter for us as we delivered the uptick in revenue that we had signaled at the beginning of the year. While we delivered good profitability, our focus on cost efficiency will continue to be a priority for several quarters to come. Now let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. Our strong results for the quarter demonstrate that we continue to executive very well against our growth strategy. We are leveraging the investments we've made in assets and solutions, in strategic acquisitions and in building the skills and capabilities of our people.","Our services are highly differentiated in the marketplace and are clearly originating with the needs of our clients as demonstrated by our records bookings year to date.","Our growth strategy is all about first, operating at the heart of our client's businesses then capturing new opportunities in key growth areas especially in digital and across the different geographic markets where we operate and finally investing to further differentiate our capabilities and services.","Let me bring each of these areas to life. Starting with how we leverage our unit, global end-to-end capabilities to drive value for clients and help them with their large scale transformation programs.","We are helping Baker Hughes a leading oil field services company transform its finance and accounting operations across 90 countries, delivering more than $50 million in annual cost saving so far. For large European banks, we are providing application development and management services to support the bank's repositioning to a new digital platform. This is a major strategic IT transformation designed to increase productivity by up to 20%.","And we are working with the leading global software company leveraging our analytics and technology capabilities in finance and accounting to deliver cost savings of more than $150 million over the next seven years.","We are executing very well in capturing in new opportunities in key growth areas. I am particularly pleased with the momentum we are seeing in Accenture Digital. We are bringing together our capabilities in Accenture Interactive and Accenture Analytics to help Telef\u00f3nica Spain significantly increase its online sales. In just six months Telef\u00f3nica drove more than 50% higher sales a year ahead of schedule.","We are levering the assets and capabilities from our recent digital acquisitions to help the leading global fashion retailer launch a new online store based on the innovative eCommerce platform. The new channel, which is going to be rolled out to 50 countries is already driving higher than expected revenues.","To me what is truly distinctive about Digital at Accenture is our ability to deliver Digital at scale and to help our clients create even greater value and business results.","We continue to benefit from the return on the investments we have made to enhance our capabilities and services. A great example is our Accenture Duck Creek software solution for property and casualty insurers, which was recently selected by both Zurich insurance and Berkshire Hathaway.","Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance is deploying our software through an innovative software-as-a-service model posted on the Accenture cloud platform, which will reduce IT costs, improve business agility and support growth.","In life sciences through our accelerating R&D business service, we have developed a new cloud-based platform, which is now being used by five major Pharma companies. This unique solution accelerates the clinical development process by collecting and analyzing data from across studies, helping our clients conduct clinical trials in a more efficient and cost effective way.","And we also continue to make targeted acquisitions. In Accenture Strategy, we just completed the acquisition of PureApps, a U.K. based company that specializes in enterprise performance management, helping CFOs to analyze their businesses and improve their cost management.","In Accenture Digital we required i4C Analytics, an advanced analytic software provider based in Italy. i4C specializes in tailored industry and function specific applications to speed up the delivery of new insights and business outcome. Now turning to the geographic dimension of our business.","Our growth in Q3 was broad based and I am particularly pleased that we delivered stronger results in Europe. In the Americas, we grew revenue 7% in local currency driven by high single digit growth in both the United States and Brazil.","In EMEA revenues increased 7% in local currency with double digit growth in France and Italy, high single digit growth in Germany and solid single digit growth in the United Kingdom and in Asia Pacific we grew revenue 6% in local currency, driven primarily by strong double digit growth in Japan.","So overall we are performing well in the context of a market environment that remains very demanding. We continue to improve our competitiveness through a relentless focus on operational investments, applying rigor and discipline across the Board to improve our efficiency, so we continue to build and position our business for sustainable long term profitable growth.","With that, I will turn the call back to David for our business outlook.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.45 billion to $7.70 billion. This is since the impact of FX will be a positive 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.","For the full fiscal year 2014 based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. Dollars will be negative 0.5% compared to fiscal 2013.","Based on our year-to-date results of 4% revenue growth in local currency and the outlook just provided for quarter four, we now expect our net revenues for the full fiscal 2014 to be in the range of 4% to 5% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year 2014, we now expect new bookings to be at the upper end of our previously guided range of $33 billion to $36 billion. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2014 to be 14.3%, an approximate 10 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2013 results.","We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5%. For earning per share, we now expect full year deluded EPS for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.54 or 7% to 8% growth over adjusted fiscal 2013 results.","Turning to cash flow, we continue to expect our operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion with property and equipment additions remaining at approximately $400 million and free cash flow in the range of $2.9 to $3.2 billion.","Finally we continue to expect to return at least $3.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 3% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","So all in all, I am pleased with how we are positioned to close out the year and as we have in the past, we will provide you with our fiscal 2015 outlook at the quarter four earnings call in September.","With that, let's open it up, so we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Katie, would you provide instructions for those on the call please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Yes thanks guys. Nice job on the bookings. I just want to hone in a little bit on the bookings trends we're seeing. You gave some good color on what types of business you are gaining, just with respect to the types of book-to-bill conversions we should expect to see and how long it takes for the conversion to occur?","And then maybe really just give us a profile of the kind of profitability in terms of the margin impact on the business given that obviously last quarter we saw a little bit of a slower trend on the margin side and you talked about Europe, but I think here, we're looking to see what these bookings really mean for the next year or so, so a little more color on those two variables will be great.","David Rowland","Okay. Well first of all, let me give you a couple of comments and perhaps Pierre will add some thoughts as well, but in terms of our book-to-bill, on the consulting side, we continue to target overall a book-to-bill of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion.","I think what we've commented on in previous calls is that given the conversion trends that we started to experience in the third quarter or so of last year, we felt that it was important to be more toward the upper end of the range, but nonetheless that range continues to be what we're focused on.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Sure.","David Rowland","From an outsourcing standpoint, again the range continues to be $1.2 billion as kind of let's say the sweet spot for us and of course anything north of that is all the better.","When you think about it, the whole translation of bookings to revenue, I think the thing that this quarter indicates is really what we've been pointing to for a while and that is that the strength of our new bookings we felt like would ultimately convert to revenue growth at higher levels, starting in the second half of this year and I think what you see is that obviously happening with our 7% growth.","The last comment quickly from a profitability standpoint, we really focus on operating margin and our model since we've been a public company is then that we expect to manage the ebb and flow of the mix of work across the consulting components of our business and the outsourcing components of our business.","It is true that not all of them have the same level of profitability, let's say the contract level or if you wanted to loosely say in gross margin terms, but they also all have very different cost structures in terms of selling cost, investment requirements, investments in people etcetera and what we are cast with doing is managing those cost, so that if the ebb and flow of our business occurs as it will across the portfolio, we meet our bottom line objectives and that's what we've been very successful doing as a public company so far.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","That's very helpful. Just one quick follow-up and then I'll turn it back to the queue. Last quarter obviously there were some comments made around pricing and around some -- obviously the implications on that on margins and I think you did a good job explaining the types of bookings you're looking at and the conversions are obviously showing much better this quarter, but are we still seeing any pricing pressures at all in the business or is it really just, was it more of a blip in the quarter or in the year last quarter, and it's calmed down?","David Rowland","Well just -- as it relates to quarter three specifically, the environment is very much stable with what we saw last quarter, meaning we haven\u2019t seen any further deterioration and the pattern is stable.","We did see in fact some pockets of improvement in the third quarter, but it's too early to call those a trend. So I think the overwriting theme is that it's stable relative to what we said last quarter.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Okay. That's good to hear. All right. Nice job guys, thanks.","David Rowland","Thank you very much, Darrin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Good morning. Glad to see the revenue come through. Just a follow-up I guess on what Darrin asked. Did anything change specifically this quarter that allowed you to covert revenue faster this quarter and just as a follow through, has visibility on revenue realization improved from the first half of the year?","David Rowland","Hey Tien-Tsin. Again, I don't think anything changed or it happened as we anticipated and as we had signaled. When you look at why did we have stronger revenue growth, I'll anchor you back to what Pierre and I've said consistently starting with the first earnings call this year.","We said that there were several things that we were encouraged by. The first thing was our pattern of strong new bookings. The second thing was the fact that the large transformational deals would start to kick in revenue growth in the second half of the year and we talked about the fact that we could -- we could point to individual contracts that gave us confidence that would occur.","The third thing we talked about was business services, the investments we've made in business services starting to materialize and then finally we anchored to the investments that we've made in inorganic.","You wrap around all of that in the third quarter, we were really pleased with our BPO business in particular, which we've talked about consistently and we're also very pleased with the activity that we see in the digital space.","So there is a lot of things that came together, but very consistent Tien-Tsin with what we've been trying to signal for a couple of quarters.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","All right. No, that's great. That makes sense Dave. So just to my follow-up I'll ask on the margin side. So the revenue did come out and cost a little bit if you look at it on a gross margin front, I guess that we should look at it on operating margins, but I am just curious, was there anything unusual in that gross margin line in this quarter and should we expect gross margin contraction to continue here in the near term, thanks?","David Rowland","Yes, thank you, Tien-Tsin. Just starting -- let me answer the question on operating margin first. The thing that I guess I'll remind you and others is that last year the third quarter was an all-time high level of profitability for Accenture.","So in absolute terms, last year's profitability was outstanding and it reflected 40 basis points growth over the prior year quarter three. So when we look at the third quarter this year, we feel very good about the absolute profitability because in fact it is equal to the highest level of profitability we've ever had in any quarter.","Having said that, what's different, we have worked hard on dealing with some of the points that we highlighted last quarter. A reference in my script that we made progress on those points, but yet we still have work to do going forward and especially as it relates to overall payroll efficiency, which will continue to be a focus area for us moving forward, but again we feel very good about the absolute profitability in the third quarter.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","All right. That's great. Thanks so much.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","All right. Thank you. So David it looks like you had growth accelerated in the third quarter as you had thought and you delivered a very strong revenue result; however it appears you left the midpoint for the yearend change.","You sound very confident in the outlook, so perhaps you can help us better understand whether there are any specific headwinds in the fourth quarter, maybe just the ordinary flow of revenue and whether the conversion rates that you saw in the third quarter is something that you see as sustainable at least as far as I can see for now.","David Rowland","Yes, again I think there is a couple of points of context that are worth mentioning. If you look at the way our revenue progressed in quarter three and quarter four of last year, quarter four of last year was a point and half higher than quarter three.","So underneath the fourth quarter, we're comparing to fourth quarter last year that was point and half higher than quarter three last year.","The other thing that I would point out is that with the range that we provided for the fourth quarter, the upper end of that range reflects continued strong healthy growth equal to what we just delivered in the third quarter and so we certainly see that as a possibility because we included it in the range.","And as we always say, although we provide a range, which reflects a range of potential outcomes, we're always working to be as high up in the range as we possibly can. So we do feel good about our business.","We had again yet another strong bookings quarter. We feel good about our visibility as we move forward and in the business, but yet as Pierre highlighted in his script, is that we have an environment that has an abundance of opportunities, but it also is one that has ongoing -- I am talking about the macro environment has ongoing challenges and uncertainty.","Operator","The next question then comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Hello Bryan.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities","Hi guys. Good morning. So just looking on a full year guidance, I guess it's a little bit unusual that the revenues are coming in ahead of expectations, but EPS is moving to the low end, just what's causing that dynamic?","David Rowland","Well there's really two simple things. The first thing is that the guidance range that we had last quarter was based on a revenue range that included 5% to 6% growth for the full year and it was based on an operating margin range that included 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion.","And so what we have done is by the way, which is what we always do after the third quarter is we've narrowed the range for the year now and the reason it has narrowed to the range that it did is because the -- we've narrowed the revenue range for the full year to 4% to 5%. So the 5% to 6% is not within the range and we are on a trajectory to deliver 10 basis points of expansion.","So if you look at those things in combination, that's the resulting range that you get for EPS, which again it is a -- it's a growth rate above revenue and that's one of the things that we talked about in our Investor Analyst Day as an important objective.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. And just as a follow-up then, the cause for the operating margin to fall in at the low end of the range as opposed to the high end and then any risk to that, the model that Accenture always has of 10 basis points to 30 basis points of margin expansion won't be continuing on an annual basis, thanks so much.","David Rowland","I think the -- the fact that our trajectory is at 10 basis points, frankly I think it anchors back to some of the things we talked about last quarter, playing it simple.","Having said that, we started the year guiding to a range of 10 to 30 and the 10 to 30 represents what we generally defined as modest margin expansion, 10 basis points as met our definition of margin -- modest margin expansion.","And we feel like if we're moving the margins up year-over-year in that 10 to 30 basis points range, that's very consistent with what our objectives have been and we think that's a reasonable place for us to land and we're balancing many things within that including investments in our business, which include the impact of acquisitions just to name that as one.","But -- so those are the things that we're managing a mix of variables, but we feel very good about the 10 basis points of expansion.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the inorganic contribution this quarter. You said it played a role and if I look at your cash flow, it looks like your acquisitions this year for the first nine months in terms of cash out is about two times of what it was last year. I was just wondering if you could talk about what the inorganic contribution to year-over-year was this quarter versus last quarter.","David Rowland","Yes, the inorganic growth varies by quarter. It can be lumpy and frankly we really don't want to get in the position of given a specific breakdown each and every quarter, but would rather talk in terms of the annual contribution.","I will tell you that quarter three reflected an acceleration in both organic and inorganic growth and we were pleased with both to be clear, but there was an important acceleration in organic that drove the $7.1 billion overall.","For the full year, if this will help you Keith, we think we're tracking to the 1.5% to may be up as high as 2% range in inorganic contribution, which is I think consistent with what I said last quarter or the quarter before, but again just to remind you is that the inorganic for us is really all about a strategy to ultimately drop organic growth.","So our inorganic is an engine for organic growth and when you look at these businesses that we're acquiring, they are essentially indistinguishable from our organic business at least within a year and Procurian, which is the most significant acquisition we've made this year in the BPO procurement space, is a great example of that.","So we feel great about the mix of our business. We're very pleased with what we've done with acquisitions really for the last four to six quarters. So hopefully that helped.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Yeah. It does. Thanks very much. For my follow-up, I would like to just try to probe a little bit more around Bryan's question on targeted operating margins. I understand it's still within the range of plus 10 basis points call it.","I was hoping to dig a little bit deeper on the causes why it's coming down. I know you highlighted M&A as one of the causes. Also, wage rates -- it sounds like it's continuing to play a role. If I look at the detail, it also looks like financial services, even on a non-GAAP basis, the operating margins were down a little bit more in those areas.","Is there something specific in financial services or products, which looks like they had the most of the year-over-year decline that you'd call out, or any other forces to illustrate what's going on with operating margins would be helpful. Thank you.","David Rowland","Yes, products and financial services are both situations where the contract profitability is lower than it was last year. I'll remind you that we do have under any circumstances we have ebb and flow or operating margin across our operating groups as their portfolio mix just evolves right.","And so a swing of a point or two in either direction shouldn\u2019t be over read at that level because sometimes it's just the ebb and flow of the portfolio and then the time of kind of balance the overall expenses associated with that.","In terms of the 10 basis points, again I guess to be blunt I am not -- I don't want to defend 10 basis points in the sense that it's very consistent, it's within the range that's been very consistent with the range we had communicated for several years now and in certain years there are circumstances where we are at the upper end of that range and other years there are circumstances where we are at the lower end of the range.","The circumstances this year I think we covered quite well on last quarter's call and again we're making improvement. We've seen progress in the third quarter in dealing with those points that we raised, but yet they are in the mix nonetheless for how we're positioned for the full year.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","So philosophically investors should be thinking about next couple of years, 10 to 30 basis points operating margin improvement is still the right way to think about it.","David Rowland","Yes, I am not going to -- I am not going to comment explicitly on forward-looking guidance. I'll just say that our overwriting objectives as an organization haven\u2019t changed.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Fair enough, many thanks.","David Rowland","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. So, I'm not going to ask you to defend the 10 basis points, but I do just want to follow up on the margin concept, which is, if we were to -- if we were disaggregating what is a function of mix, that is shifting to what would ultimately be considered lower dollar profit, relative to, let's say, wage inflation cost, how would you have us parse that? As we think about this quarter, the combination of what you talked about last quarter, and then thinking about what is ultimately embedded in your bookings? Thank you.","David Rowland","Yes, frankly that is such -- that there are so many new nuances and so much kind of detail in trying to answer that question, it's just even if that was information that we wanted to share that level of detail it's just I can't really do it in three minutes on an earnings call to be frank.","Again what I would say is that in general terms what I would say is that job number one for us in driving our profitability objective going forward is to get payroll efficiency right. And that is something that we've traditionally done very, very well and that is something that is we are extremely focused on in particular in the next several quarters given some of the things we highlighted last week.","Job number two in optimizing our profitability is to manage the mix across our portfolio. So finding the right mix where the opportunities are in the marketplace and then as the mix shifts across the different offerings that we provide to then job number three is to align our underlying cost structure to make sure that it's consistent with the realities of our portfolio of work.","And I mean at a very simple level those are the things that we've always had to focus on and that's what we'll continue to focus on going forward.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just quickly: How important, ultimately, is the correlated rebound in EMEA to your consulting business, because we're seeing some trends in both of those and I'm just wondering, from a sustainability perspective, how important is that for you to have both trending in the right direction? Or do you think consulting can actually throttle up, even in the face of EMEA maybe having problems in the future? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","We're definitely very pleased to see the rebound we had in EMEA, which is something we've been watching very carefully this last quarter. And we invested a lot in EMEA around client opportunities, especially around large-scale transformations program combining consulting outsourcing and BPO across the Board and as we expected, starting in Q3, we see EMEA coming back.","And what I am particularly pleased with is when you look at the countries contributing to EMEA growth both from a consulting and outsourcing standpoint, we have quite largest markets in the country and countries in Europe and think about France, Italy, Germany the U.K.","And it is very encouraging to see that with the slow recovery of Europe that seems to show some sustained ability on this slow recovery in Europe is creating more confidence with investors and this is what's explaining the pickup of our business in Europe plus the execution of the strategy we mentioned before.","Large scale transformation, operating at the heart of our clients operation, investing in the new -- by the new I am thinking a lot around the digital and the excellent contribution of BPO. So it's quite well balanced across the Board, but again it's probably more on the outsourcings and the consulting, but anyway pleased with both results.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Excellent. Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Thank you. Could you characterize how much of your business comes from emerging markets and maybe discuss what's going on in some of those particularly China and Brazil?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, so if you look at the way we now -- look at the markets, you have North America, you have Europe and you have what we might call the gross market, which is a little bit different from what you have in Americas, EMEA and APAC.","So clearly the vast majority of the business we're doing is concentrated in North America and Europe. Now we're pleased with what we are doing in APAC in Africa and in Latin America. So let me give you some insights, which are noteworthy.","Starting with Latin America as you know and we signaled that in the prior quarters, we were watching carefully what was happening in Brazil. We had excellent performance for many years and we had a kind of pause almost a year ago literally.","So again it's very encouraging to see that through all the efforts made by our Brazilian leadership, Brazil is back with high single digit growth this quarter. So again, we're going to watch that carefully, but it's very encouraging signals.","Moving to APAC, very consistent and very important for us because it's a large country for Accenture. Japan is sustaining a very strong double-digit growth and it's not the story of a quarter. It's been true this last quarter.","So we're building a stronger practice in one the largest market as well in APAC to a smaller scale, but very interesting. We had very good performance in India as well, which has continued to growing very well and I can mention even Middle East in new places where we see good prospects.","And may be finally getting to Africa, this is probably a place where we need to put more attention especially in South Africa as you know which is a country, which is very dependent on natural resources and very consistent what David mentioned previously natural resources, very cyclical challenging industry.","South Africa very dependent on natural resources and it's a country where we are most challenged. All in all we're pleased with the progress we are making in all emerging markets.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","That's great. Thank you. And I was curious what role you're playing in helping companies think through their adoption of cloud, and if your cloud brokering business is doing well and could become significant.","Pierre Nanterme","We couldn\u2019t be more cloud friendly at that venture. We embrace the cloud. We promote the cloud. And the cloud is developing very well because it's bringing to our clients a true and compelling value proposition in the way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations.","You\u2019ve seen in a couple of cases I shared with you that cloud was quite prominent either in the way we're proposing application package as a service. I am very pleased with what we are doing with our own solution called Duck Creek, delivered at Berkshire Hathaway as a service, and operated in Accenture Cloud. And I think these days is probably a piece of art, if you will in the way we are delivering a package in a new and compelling way as a service and we are operating this service in Accenture Cloud platform. So we are a big fan of this.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Foresi with Janney. Please go ahead.","Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. I just want to go back to profitability really quickly. Where are you seeing the biggest impact on profitability? Is that new or old work? And what does that imply going forward? I'm just wondering if its renewals or the new work that you were seeing the pricing issues that you mentioned last quarter?","David Rowland","Yes, I would say that I guess in answering the question maybe I will start with saying that we were very pleased with the work that we contracted in the third quarter from a profitability standpoint overall.","Again I think that some of the things we talked about last quarter I mean, I would just be redundant with those -- with those messages, we had last quarter declared some pricing pressure. We related that to some pressure on profitability, but yet we've said this quarter that it's been stable.","We highlighted last quarter some pressure in contract profitability, but yet we actually were pleased with our contract profitability this quarter and saw some positive progression from where we were last quarter. So that's kind of our existing book of business and maybe I could just be concise in answer it that way in that we are always focused on improving contract profitability.","We did see some improvement from last quarter to this quarter sequentially and again we were very pleased with the economics of the deals that we contracted in the third quarter.","Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","That's very helpful and just my follow-up, consulting looked like it up-ticked a little bit going, what was the driver of that and how sustainable is that driver going forward? What should we be looking for to see what the trends in consulting can look like?","Pierre Nanterme","On the consulting if you look and it's not the old story, but clearly all what we are doing in digital is a big contributor and is getting a stronger and stronger contributor if you will to our consulting business.","You will find in this consulting all the work we are doing through Accenture Interactive with all the capabilities from a management consulting standpoint to a system integration standpoint, solutions we're providing to enable the digital consumer.","I am thinking about all the work we're doing through Accenture Mobility, again a good combination of management consulting and system integration work to enable mobility. Couldn\u2019t be more pleased that recently Fiat accepted to communicate around the UConnect Solution we've been putting in place, which is absolutely cutting and leading-edge in mobility and of course very pleased with the momentum of Accenture Analytics, which again is a good mix of MC and system integration to what we are calling consulting and all of this is now becoming a stronger driver for our consulting growth.","Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.","Pierre Nanterme","Hey David.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Hello David. Employee attrition moved up two points in the quarter to 14% from 12%, what was the key reason for that?","David Rowland","It's -- I don't think that there was anything in particular underneath that. It's -- that 14% is well within our tolerant zone and there is ebb and flow and so just frankly there really isn\u2019t a story behind that. It's just kind of the normal flow of how attrition goes.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Just as a key follow-up, you mentioned a target of 65,000 gross employee adds for this year, is that an uptick from what you indicated in Q2?","David Rowland","It is. I think KC can correct me, but I think we said 60,000 last quarter and we said -- and then 65,000 this quarter.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","And which practice areas are you adding more employees versus previous plan.","David Rowland","It's across our practice. There is not a particular area of concentration. There is clearly a mix of GDN in there obviously, but beyond that, we are, we're doing some level of hiring probably in most of the markets around the globe and some of it relates to many of the things Pierre has commented on where we have these new exciting areas that are growth engines for us going forward and we're always bringing skills and talent on Board.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Understood. Thank you very much.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","A question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird Co.","Yes, hey guys. Good morning. Great job.","David Rowland","Good morning.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird Co.","And so I guess just a couple of kind of cash flow items, this is the first year in a while we've talked about this before that free cash flow was kind of going to be in line maybe even a little below income and just wondering if over time, you kind of expect that to exceed earnings. Just kind of wondering kind of your long term expectations around that.","David Rowland","Yes, I think I've said last quarter that we feel very good about our -- the structural drivers if you will of our cash flow and so we expect to be a business that continues to focus on cash flow as part of our economic model. We continue to have industry leading DSOs. We have a capital like business. We don't anticipate that that's going to change.","So -- and we are always focused on managing our profitability, which gets to our cash operating expense outflow in a particular year. So this year is what it is, but we think that the structural underpinnings of our business from that standpoint remain unchanged.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird Co.","Good. And just because there haven\u2019t been quite enough questions on margins yet, one small item with last quarter, last quarter you talked a little bit about the bonus accruals being brought down a few hundred million just to manage cost and given how good revenue trends are now, I knew that that's very encouraging, I am just wondering if that has been undone a little bit and may be that part of the reason that margins are a little lower.","David Rowland","Yes, not to disappoint you with the answer, but I'll just remind you David and you and the others who remember that we really have had a practice, I am not talking about variable comp and the only time when we'll talk about it is when it is important to understanding the story in a particular quarter, which is not the normal scenario.","We commented on it last quarter because it was relevant to understanding the story. That is not the case this quarter, and so the expectation is going to be that we are not going to do a root canal on variable comp each and every quarter.","I appreciate the question. I appreciate why you asked it. We kind of served it up with what we said last quarter that that's our position on it.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird Co.","Got you. Well, great progress.","David Rowland","Thank you. Appreciate it.","KC McClure","Katie, we have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","And the last question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for sneaking me in. Is application outsourcing growing faster or it pans above or below overall outsourcing segment and if you could just talk about how you are responding to the market pressures in this offering?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, again we're very pleased with all the application outsourcing, overall the outsourcing part of our business, especially pleased with the application outsourcing business, which has been growing nicely.","It's clearly responding to a strong demand from our clients in rationalizing their IT operation. It is a very competitive market. It's a very competitive environment and it's a very large market as well.","So no doubt Accenture will want to compete in that very large market and being extremely competitive in this marketplace and we are of course benefitted from all our global delivering work and we talked about now the 190,000 people we have in our different delivery network supporting not only application outsourcing and BPO.","So, we believe today that despite the fact that it's a highly demanding and competitive environment, we are equipped to fight and win in that particular segment and this has reflected in the excellent growth we had in Q3.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Sara.","Pierre Nanterme","All right. It's time to close the call and thanks again for joining us on today's call. In closing, very briefly let me share a few thoughts.

And thanks everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased with our excellent financial results for both the second quarter and the first half of 2018. For the quarter, we again delivered strong double-digit revenue growth which was broad based across all dimensions of our business. We continued to go ahead of the market and are clearly gaining significant market share. ","I am positively pleased with our record new bookings. The very strong demand we are seeing especially in digital, cloud and security, demonstrate that we continue to provide clients with highly differentiated and relevant services. Here are a few highlights for the second quarter and year-to-date. ","We delivered excellent new booking of $10.3 billion for the quarter and 20.2 billion for the first half. We grew revenues 10% in local currency for both the quarter and year-to-date. We delivered outstanding earnings per share for the quarter of $1.58 on an adjusted basis, 19% increase and for the first half EPS grew 16% on an adjusted basis. ","Operating margin was 13.4% for the quarter and 14.5% for the first half, a contraction of 20 basis points year-to-date. We generated very strong free cash flow of $791 million for the quarter and nearly 1.7 billion year-to-date. And we continue to return substantial cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends including $2.2 billion year-to-date.","Today, we announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.33 per share, which will bring total dividend payment for the year to $2.66 per share, a 10% increase over last year. So as we move in the second half of 2018 I feel very good about the momentum in our business. We are raising our business outlook for revenues, earning per share and free cash flow, and I am confident in our ability to deliver another strong year. ","Now let me hand over to David, who will review the number in greater detail. David over to you. ","David Rowland","Thank you Pierre and thanks all of you for taking the time to join us all in today\u2019s call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our financial results in the second quarter, which put us on a strong trajectory to exceed the net revenue, EPS and cash flow guidance provided at the beginning of the year. ","Once again our results this quarter reflect broad based momentum across every dimension of our business and reinforce our relevance and differentiation as the market leader in innovating and leading (inaudible).","Before I get in to the details of the quarter, let me summarize the major headlines of our results. Continued strong topline growth was the first major headline with net revenues increasing almost $1.3 billion, reflecting growth of 10% in local currency. The overall theme of broad based growth was evident again this quarter with strong growth across all five operating groups and all three geographic areas with double-digit growth in three operating groups and in both Europe and the growth markets. ","Growth continues to significantly outpace the market, driven by strong double-digit growth in all three components avenue including digital, cloud and security related services. As a second major headline, we delivered EPS in the quarter of $1.58 on an adjusted basis, reflecting 19% growth over last year. This level of EPS growth was driven primarily by 13% growth in our operating income. ","At the same time, operating margin of 13.4% decreased 30 basis points compared with quarter two of last year. Our operating margin primarily reflects the impact of lower profitability in H&PS, as well as the impact of the record level of investments made in fiscal \u201817 to acquire critical skills and capabilities in high growth areas of our business.","We do expect operating margin expansion in the second half of the year, and I\u2019ll come back to that in our business outlook. ","The third major headline relates to outstanding cash flow in the quarter of $791 million, resulting in 1.7 billion on a year-to-date basis, which puts us on a very strong trajectory for the full year. For the first half of the year, we continue to execute against our strategic capital allocation objectives first by investing over $340 million primarily attributed to five transactions and second by returning roughly $2.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.","With that said, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $10.3 billion for the quarter, representing a record high in our third consecutive quarter with bookings of 10 billion or more. Our consulting bookings were 5.7 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1 and outsourcing bookings were 4.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. ","Bookings continue to be well balanced across the dimensions of our business and the dominant driver of our bookings in the quarter continue to be high demand for digital, cloud and security related services which we estimate represented more than 60% of our new bookings. ","Looking now at revenue; net revenues for the quarter were $9.6 billion, an increase of 15% in USD and 10% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange tailwind of roughly 5.5% compared to the 4.5% impact provided last quarter. This result was approximately $95 million above the upper end of our FX adjusted range. ","Our consulting revenues for the quarter were 5.2 billion up 17% in USD and 11% in local currency, and our outsourcing revenues were 4.4 billion, up 13% in USD and 8% in local currency. ","Looking at the trend and estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions, growth was led by application services which posted double digit growth, driven by strong demand in application development services to deploy new technologies. Operations grew high single-digits and strategy and consulting services combined grew mid-single digits. ","And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to deliver strong double digit growth in digital, cloud and security related services by leveraging the significant investments we\u2019ve made in recent years to build highly differentiated capabilities. ","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, communications, media and technology led all operating groups with 15% growth in local currency. Continued momentum was driven by double-digit growth in both software and platforms in communications and media as well as double-digit growth across all geographies. ","Resources grew 11% in the quarter, driven by strong double-digit growth in chemicals and natural resources and further improvement in energy which posted strong growth. We were pleased with the strong balanced growth across all three geographies and resources. ","Products delivered 10% growth in the quarter, representing its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth which is an incredible accomplishment. Growth was led by strong double-digit growth in industrial and strong growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services. Europe and growth markets both grew double digits reflecting continued strong demand for our services. ","Financial services grew 7% in local currency, reflecting strong balanced growth in both bank in the capital markets and insurance. Growth was strong across all three geographies including double-digit growth in the growth markets. And finally, H&PS grew 6% with relatively balanced growth in both health and public service, led by double digit growth in Europe and the growth markets and solid growth in North America. ","Moving down the income statement; gross margin for the quarter was 29.7% compared to 30.1% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.4% compared to 10.5% for the second quarter last year and general and administrative expense was 5.9% consistent with the same quarter last year. ","Operating income was $1.3 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.4% operating margin, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to quarter two last year. ","Before I continue with the other metrics, I\u2019d like to highlight that this quarter we recognized a provisional tax expense of $137 million primarily to re-measure our net deferred tax assets at the new lower tax rates. This expense increased our quarter two tax rate by 11% and decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.21. The following adjusted results exclude this impact. ","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.1% compared to an effective tax rate of 20.7% for the second quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.58 compared to EPS of $1.33 in the second quarter last year, and again this reflects a 19% year-over-year increase. Our day services outstanding were 40 days compared to 43 days last quarter and 42 in the second quarter of last year. ","Our free cash flow for the quarter was $791 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of 924 million, net of property and equipment additions of 133 million. Our cash balance at February 28 was $3.6 billion compared with $4.1 billion at August 31.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders in the second quarter we repurchased or redeemed 5.2 million shares for 804 million at an average price of $1.55 $0.30 per share. At February 28, we had approximately 2.1 billion of shares repurchase authority remaining. ","And as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.33 per share, representing a 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May last year. This dividend will be paid on May 15, 2018. So at the half way point of fiscal \u201818, we\u2019ve delivered very strong results and are very well positioned for the remainder of the year. ","Now let me turn it back to Pierre. ","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. Our excellent performance in the second quarter and year-to-date demonstrate that we have the right growth strategy and that we are executing extremely well. With cent percent revenue growth in local trends in the first half, we continue to grow much higher than the market and indeed we have outperformed our basket of competitor for now 16 consecutive quarters for years. ","Our strong and durable performance, reflects our ability to rapidly scale our market leading position in the new digital, cloud and security services, and for the first half, revenues from the [new] were nearly $11 billion more than 55% of total revenues and continued to grow at a very strong double-digit rate. ","The accelerated rotation of our business reflect the significant investment we have made over the last few years including record investments last year in strategic acquisitions in building assets and solution and in hiring and developing the most relevant talent. Let me [bring] to light in two key parts of our business, Accenture Interactive and Accenture Security. ","With Accenture interactive, we are scaling to further strengthen our leadership position. And for the last two years, we are recognized at Advertising Age as the world\u2019s largest provider of digital marketing services. Just this month, Walt Disney Studios named Accenture Interactive along with Fjord, an innovation partner for its new StudioLAB. ","With our (inaudible) strategy, design and technology, along with our deep industry experience and the applied R&D capabilities of Accenture labs, we are helping Disney to apply emerging technologies, immersive entertainment, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things to create the future of entertainment, and we continue to invest in Accenture Interactive to enhance our capabilities and market differentiation, including four acquisitions we made in the Mackevision, a leading producer of 3D and immersive content in Germany; Altima, a French digital commerce agency; Rothco, a creative agency in Ireland; and MATTER, a design and innovation firm in the US. ","We\u2019re also rapidly scaling Accenture Security. Less than three years ago, we committed to building a market-leading, cyber security business to help clients become more resilient to cyber threats. Today, Accenture Security is one of the largest providers in the market approaching $2 billion in annual revenues. ","Our security business benefit significantly from Accenture\u2019s global scale, and we tailor industry specific solutions across the full range of security services including identity and access management, cyber defense, managed security and strategic and risk. We are helping leading insurance company transform its cyber defense with an advanced threat incident response program, including automation and training for their people which has dramatically reduced the time to detect and respond to [service]. ","Accenture has a unique ability to scale the new, with the breadth and scope of service we provide end-to-end from strategy and consulting to digital technology and operations together with outdating the expertise. We are positioned at the call of our clients\u2019 largest transformation programs. We are working with the LG Company on the global transformation program with SAP S\/4HANA designed to streamline manufacturing and supply chain processes, gain real-time customer insight to improve decision making and accelerate innovation to drive growth. And we continue to work with clients on mission critical integrations. ","We helped DBS Bank, the largest bank in Southeast Asia with a successful positive merger integration of the wealth management and retail banking businesses acquired from ANZ Bank in five key markets including Indonesia, Taiwan and Singapore. ","Now turning to the geographic dimension of our business; I am particularly pleased that we continue to deploy our capabilities in the new, at scale, in the largest markets around the world. In North America, we delivered 8% growth in local currency led by another uptick in growth in the United States. ","In Europe, we had another quarter of double-digit growth with 10% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in Germany, Italy, France and Spain. And I\u2019m especially pleased that given our significant market share gains over the last few years in Europe, we are now positioned as the market leader. And we delivered another excellent quarter in growth market with 15% revenue growth in local currency. ","Japan again led the way with very strong double-digit growth, but we had double-digit growth as well in Australia, Brazil and Singapore. Before I turn it back to David, I want to say a few words about innovation and how we are building scale through continued investment in our unique innovation architecture which integrates our capabilities from research, ventures and labs to studio, innovation centers and delivery centers to bring even more innovation to clients, appeal the global network of more than 100 world class centers where we collaborate with clients and co-create innovative digital solutions, and by extending this network to be even closer to clients. ","In the last few months, we opened new innovation hubs in Zurich, Tokyo, Boston and Columbus. We launched a new Liquid Studio in Madrid, and we opened our new industrial IoT innovation center in Modena, Italy. ","Quite simply innovation is at the heart of everything we do at Accenture, and we will continue to invest not only to scale our current capability in the new, but also to anticipate the next wave of technology and business disruptions to keep Accenture ahead of the curve in the new.","So with that I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal \u201918, we expect net revenues to be in the range of $9.9 billion to $10.15 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about 5.5%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal \u201817, and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth local currency. ","For the full fiscal year \u201818, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in US dollar will be 4% compared to fiscal \u201817. For the full fiscal \u201818, we now expect our net revenues to be in the range of 7% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal \u201817. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year \u201818 to be 14.8%, consistent with adjusted fiscal \u201817 results. This assumes approximately 20 basis points of expansion in the second half of the year. ","We expect our GAAP annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Excluding the impact of the US tax law changes, we continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. For earnings per share, we expect our GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal \u201818 to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.49. ","Excluding the change related to US tax law changes, we now expect full year diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.61 to $6.70 or 12% to 13% growth over adjusted fiscal \u201817 results. For the full fiscal \u201818, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately 600 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion. ","Finally, we continue to expect to return at least 4.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. ","With that, let\u2019s open it up so we can take your questions. Angie?","Angie Park","Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Karen, would you provide instructions for those on the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Very strong (inaudible) growth, obviously it looks like it might be coming in at a slightly higher cost. Maybe what surprised you exactly on the margin front? I think you mentioned H&PS, can you elaborate there? We figured maybe contract profitability or use of subcontractors as I may have missed it. If you could elaborate that would be great.","David Rowland","Yes, on H&PS there are really two set of things at play; first of all, we had a decline in profitability that was primarily driven by lower contract profitability on a few large contracts, and some of that relates to renewals at lower level of profitability that may have been previously contracted out. ","And then secondly in the mix for H&PS are higher acquisition-related costs for a number of acquisitions that we\u2019ve done over the trailing four quarters. So those are really the two factors in H&PS, our leadership team is very focused on the profit agenda in H&PS and we do expect H&PS\u2019s profit to improve in the second half of the year. But in the quarter, those were the two primary drivers.","Tien-tsin Huang","Right. So I guess as my follow-up and just a follow-up too on the confidence in the margin expansion in the second (inaudible), and more importantly any reason why Accenture can\u2019t return to the typical 10 to 30 bps that we\u2019ve seen for so long here? It sounds like you can address those contract issues but anything else to (inaudible)?","David Rowland","What I would say is; stating the obvious; this year\u2019s guidance at 14.8 is in the context of this year. It in no way signals anything about what our ability is on an ongoing basis to deliver modest margin expansion. And while as you know, I\u2019m not going to provide specific guidance, I do feel comfortable saying in general terms that our strategic objective to overtime expand our margins modestly in the 10 basis points to 30 basis point range remains intact. There isn\u2019t anything about this year that changes our view on that.","Operator","Next question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","I wanted to ask about consulting, it seems like the new is driving a lot of the consulting work. Can you talk about the growth rate there and also about the conversation rate into more steady business, is that about the same or has it changed since prior years?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, indeed, our consulting business as you\u2019ve seen has become stronger and stronger and you\u2019ve seen specially we are really pleased with the bookings we see in our consulting business. The rotation to the new [easy] factor explaining that we are gaining more consulting business but as well the rotation to the new is consulting as well, creating a ripple affect with the rest of Accenture. So it has a good contribution in the full range of our services, from strategy to consulting, digital and technology, and as well operations. ","So the new is really impacting across the board, but we see a very positive impact in our strategy and consulting business as well as in system integration. Bookings are very strong, and if bookings are very strong, it\u2019s because we have a good win and conversation rate.","David Rowland","And I\u2019ll just add one point to what Pierre said I think an important insight in the mix of consulting is a very strong market in our platform business. You when we talk about our platform business, we\u2019re talking about SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, and Workday primarily, and that part of our business is growing very well. There is definitely a lot of market activity around next generation ERP, and we\u2019re benefiting from that in our consulting business. ","And as Pierre said the conversion rate - with stronger growth in consulting, those projects on average tend to be shorter in duration, so bookings do tend to convert to revenue at a faster rate.","Joseph Foresi","And it looks like the business outside of the new is improving a little bit. Can you talk about that and any comments on your strategy or your strategy in the business outside of the new? ","Pierre Nanterme","Good question. Now we could say the new is the business of Accenture. So I think we will continue to talk about (inaudible) to the new, because what we believe at Accenture is the wave of this new emerging disruptive technology will continue to come in at an incredible pace. That\u2019s why we continue to talk about the new, because today we\u2019ve been talking a lot about interactive mobility, analytics, and cloud security. ","We know to some extent the next new, if I could use that language is coming fast in terms of immersive realities, blockchain, even quantum gate and other technologies. So the new is Accenture, now the remaining core is pretty solid and we are pleased with that because frankly we have invested as well to continue modernizing the core. ","So we didn\u2019t play defense, which is something we don\u2019t like to do at Accenture frankly, but we played the attack by modernizing our core business, and I\u2019m thinking about what we\u2019ve been doing in terms of bringing a lot of [robotic] automations in our services in terms of application outsourcing, in terms of business process services. ","So, we improve and increase the competitiveness of our services vis-\u00e0-vis of our clients, and by the way it does reflect in the good growth we had in technology and operations. So we don\u2019t let the core down, we invest in the core, we pay interest tax, we modernize, and we continue to be a very stronger player and leader in the core.","Operator","Next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Just wanted to ask about the tax rate; I know the tax rate was lower, I think it was 15.1% for the quarter. But you kind of reiterated the guidance for the year at [20] to 24. I think that implies a second half tax rate that\u2019s higher, maybe 27% to 28%. So post tax reform, just thinking is that a newer, higher tax rate going forward, just thinking about tax?","David Rowland","Our tax rate is lumpy by quarter. The tax rate in any particular quarter is essentially driven by four things, it\u2019s driven by the geographic mix, it\u2019s driven by the change in reserves, it\u2019s driven by final determinations, and it\u2019s also driven by the tax impact of equity compensation. So for example, if you look at the second quarter, the second quarter typically has a structurally lower tax rate, the lowest of the four quarters, primarily because of the equity compensation, and the fact that the equity compensation is primarily granted on January 1. ","And as you know when our stock is appreciating as it has been, and the stock price is higher when it was initially granted as opposed to the [best] date, then we get a tax benefit from that, which is what we see, for example in the second quarter of this year. So, do not read anything into the implied tax rate for the second half of the year or quarter three or quarter four. I would focus more on the annual tax rate and recognize that in any given year our tax rate is lumpy by quarter for any number of reasons.","Bryan Keane","And then just a quick follow-up on tax rate, I know in the Q, I think it talked about the effective tax rate could go up 3.5 points in fiscal year \u201819 due to the adoption of the FAS-B, I think it\u2019s the intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. Just curious if we should just expect going forward a higher tax rate as well? And then just a quick question on the operations group, it just moderated a tad from its consistent double-digit growth. Just wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything implied on that slower growth rate going forward? ","David Rowland","You are a student of tax when you get into that question. So we did disclose the ASU that you referenced in our K. And in that disclosure, we commented on a potential impact of up to 3.5 percentage points. I think I might have also called out, at that time, that that is an impact in isolation, but as always there are other things that impact our tax rate including tax planning. ","Also you\u2019re asking about \u201919, in the case of \u201819, you\u2019re aware that the base erosion tax kicks in, but it kicks in at a lower level than it does in \u201820. So there are a lot of things in the mix in \u201819. Again I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on guidance, but I will say that, as we sit now subject to change as we continue to evaluate our tax situation, we don\u2019t see a material change in our tax rate in \u201819 from the adjusted guidance that we\u2019re providing this year. And I\u2019ll update that in September, but that\u2019s our current view.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. I just was asking really quick on the operations group. It had been double-digits consistently, and then it\u2019s just high-single digits now, so just wanted to see if there is any [color]. But thanks, congrats on the quarter.","Pierre Nanterme","I\u2019m going to give a quick one. No change.","David Rowland","No change on operations. ","Operator","Next question is from Brian Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Bryan Bergin","Wanted to ask on the local currency revenue guide range for the year, relative to the strong 10% first half of performance, anything you\u2019re seeing now in the second if it wouldn\u2019t leave you more bullish for the full year range?","David Rowland","One thing is that the inorganic contribution will be incrementally lower in the second half of the year. That\u2019s in the mix, but other than that, there is not anything specifically. As you know, I think everyone knows is that we work very hard to land towards the upper end of the range, and we feel very good about our business as we turn the page to the second half of the year. We feel great about our pipeline, we expect to have another good bookings quarter in the third quarter, and we\u2019re going to work hard every day to try to land at the upper end of the range, and that would be a good result.","Bryan Bergin","Can you comment on where that inorganic was for the quarter, and then on the interactive business, we\u2019ve seen the challenges demonstrated by the traditional agencies with market spend evolving. What do you think is the biggest difference in your model that\u2019s enabling your stronger relative growth?","David Rowland","I\u2019ll comment briefly on inorganic and then I\u2019ll I\u2019m going to let Pierre pick up on the second. Previously we had said 2.5% to 3% for inorganic, and I would say now we\u2019re looking at more like 2.5%. So really its 2.5% for the year, I\u2019m referring to.","Pierre Nanterme","On Accenture Interactive, and I clearly understand your question. When you look in the typical business of the agency, there are things we\u2019re competing against and things we\u2019re not doing at all. And the things we are not doing at all is all in this buying business you have in the agencies and this business is trending down significantly, as we all know. So we are not in this typical part of the business. Where we are focused on is clearly the high growth part of this digital marketing environment, where what we are calling brand meets creativity enabled by technology. This is the sweet spot we decided to invest in and we benefit from the investment. ","Second is, we are certainly one of the very few, if not unique to provide a full range of services against our mentality of end-to-end from design to production services to commerce services to analytic services, and now, we\u2019re launching intelligent marketing services. So we have this full range of technologies from experience to enabling the customer to want magic of marketing in digital as well with the physical experience, what we\u2019re now calling the physical, the combination of physical and digital. ","And three, it\u2019s just the leverage of the full scale and footprint of Accenture. Just bear in mind, we are among the very few if you compare to any of our competitors to operate in more than 50 markets or 50 countries. We are covering more than 15 industries, I guess, 19. So when you look at the depths and breadths of our footprint, we have the opportunity to grow in much more industries and in much more markets, bringing these end-to-end capabilities, highly differentiated, and targeted in high growth areas. ","Proof-point, take Fjord as an illustration, we acquired now three or four years ago with around 150 people, maybe 160. Now, they are more than a 1.000 people creating the largest experience agency in the world. This is the leverage which is provided by Accenture, and this leverage opportunity is absolutely second to none in the marketplace.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Brian Essex","I was wondering if first of all, if I could dig into your conversation with Tien-tsin, just on Health & Public Services, these contracts that were signed at lower profitability rates. Is there anything in the quarter that was maybe one-time in nature in terms of upfront costs that give you confidence in better profitability on a run rate basis or maybe a little bit of color on those, just to give us confidence in margin expansion going forward?","David Rowland","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s not anything one-time in nature that would be appropriate to call out on this call. In a big operating group, there are a lot of things in the mix. And I would tell you that we have a very, very strong leadership team led by Dan London and our H&PS operating group and they are very diligently focusing on both driving the strategy and growth agenda, but also our profitability agenda. ","And I have confidence the trajectory for H&PS in the second half of the year is going to be a positive trajectory. They are working all levers that we normally focus on, which is everything from our pricing to our cost of delivery, through to the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales and marketing costs, our investments, etcetera. And I think they\u2019ve got the levers at their disposal to navigate an improving trajectory.","Brian Essex","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe on the financial services, you continue to outpace your peers with some pretty strong constant currency growth there. Looks like a more European focus. Maybe a little bit of color in terms of conversations that you\u2019re having with your customers\u2019 budget outlook for the remainder of the year and an outlook for ongoing strong growth in that segment?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, of course. Frankly, financial services by and large if you look this (inaudible) has been strong. It is an industry, despite all of the value effects around that industry. It\u2019s an industry which is still investing a lot in technology because financial services is all about tech. And they have to invest if they want to stay relevant. ","Now, you have some very specific areas of growth. I\u2019m thinking about risk and regulatory management. You know what\u2019s happening in financial services, there\u2019s a lot on regulatory requirements across the world, especially in Europe, we have to do the paddle (inaudible). In insurance, the severance in capital market, they have their own regulation as well, and then you have all the risk management which is a very hot place in financial services for all the reasons we know. ","So it\u2019s creating a significant market, so all what we could, we are calling (inaudible), risk and regulatory management. Of course the other part is always related to omni-channel management. In financial services and in banking, you need now to have an omni-channel architecture with your physical branches, where you\u2019re adding your digital capabilities. And all of this should create a seamless customer experience. ","All of this has to be built, so you need a lot of strategic work to create this experience architecture, and then you need to build the digital platforms and all the new related processes. And maybe three, is data; financial services is an industry where you\u2019re mining tons of data, tons of information. And all this concept for the banks, mining their own data, I\u2019m talking about the data of the banks to find new business models that could create value is very (inaudible). ","So the activity there, you mentioned Europe rightfully, because in Europe, it\u2019s true in the US, but it\u2019s very true in Europe, the retail businesses is pretty depressed because the interest rates are pretty low. So, when your interest rates are pretty low, you\u2019re not delivering the same profit in your core business, the retail business. So you need to do something in order to uplift your growth and improve our market. ","So the financial services is under pressure, but again it\u2019s like the other businesses. They\u2019re under pressure, so they are looking for new capabilities, new business models, and this is where we position those services.","Operator","Next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","It sounds like he had a bad connection, do you want to go to the next one, are you hearing me better now or --? Darrin we cannot hear you actually, you\u2019re breaking up on us. ","Angie Park","Karen, why don\u2019t we go to the next caller, please?","Operator","The next question comes from David Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Koning","My first question is just the other expense line, the 44 million or so in Q2, how is that supposed to look in the future and what exactly is that again?","David Rowland","That is primarily FX (inaudible), essentially what is driving that this year. We have two types of hedging we do; we hedge certain balance sheet items to hedge against intercompany movement of cash and transactions, and then the other hedging program of course is on our GDN. But there are some balance sheet items we don\u2019t hedge. So some of those are unhedged losses, if you will. ","But then even for our hedging programs, at times the hedging programs can result in hedging gains or losses below operating income. So that\u2019s all in the mix. The simple answer is, it\u2019s all related to hedging losses this quarter and that can vary quarter-to-quarter. And so all that\u2019s accounted for the important point in our EPS guidance.","David Koning","And then just one follow-up, the acquisition spending the last two quarters has been less than it had been in several prior quarters. Is there any expectation that that kind of ramps back up in the back half?","David Rowland","We think it will be stronger in the back half of the year, but we think we could land a bit lower than $1 billion for the full year.","Operator","Next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Arvind Ramnani","Can you talk about the nature of conversations on some of the new areas, such as AI and blockchain, including the scope and size of these projects?","Pierre Nanterme","As I\u2019ve said before particularly at Accenture, it\u2019s called the new and the [nu-new]. And I encourage all of you and I will mention that in a few minutes to participate with the idea, because we will reveal a lot about the nu-new and what\u2019s next. So I\u2019m going to give to you some flavor on the blockchain, on the artificial intelligence. ","On the blockchain, there are more and more projects, and again, what we see is we\u2019re starting to move from typical prototypes and proof-of-concept to [famous book] to projects starting to get some scale. We\u2019re not yet there and I think we\u2019re starting to see what\u2019s most important with blockchain. What are the relevant areas where blockchain could create value? And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in our labs. This is what we\u2019re doing with cool innovation with our partners. ","And when you have a new technology, the big question is how you create business and value out of this new tech. This is what we\u2019re doing currently with the accounts of several banks in Singapore. So it can do banking arrangement, where we see lots of application of blockchain. Capital markets as well. This is what we\u2019re doing with the exchange in Australia.","Very recently, we announced new opportunities in the shipping industry with a subsidiary of St Maarten CGM, which is one of the largest shipping company in the world. In the contract management, we see the payments, we see the transaction exchange, and we see a lot around document and contract management. At first we\u2019re starting to explore is as well around tracking and food security or security in tracking the supply chain. So payment, transaction exchange, contract management, tracking of the supply chain, these are four applied opportunities on the blockchain. ","On artificial intelligence, probably it would take two days to mention all of the opportunities we see in applying the artificial intelligence across the globe. Clearly, the way we look at it, because we are absolutely obsessed with applying technology to create value. I\u2019m not using a data, the kind of (inaudible) thing, where at the end of the day you don\u2019t know exactly what to do with it. So that\u2019s why we call applied intelligence and not artificial intelligence unit, and pushing our people to deliver value to clients with the italics. ","Today, we are really focusing on analytics, plus machine learning, and then you\u2019re putting the growing mix of artificial intelligence on top of it. It\u2019s playing a lot with data, it\u2019s playing a lot in the manufacturing industry, where now you have tons of sensors where you can mine the data and do things such as predicting investments, just to mention one of not just application, but we see a lot of artificial intelligence in the predictive business, massive application in healthcare and life science. ","Couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the partnership we made with Roche in cancer research, when we\u2019re working on the app, which is called a Tumor Board, where we are integrating machine learning and algorithmic artificial intelligence to improve cancer diagnosis and recommendations for the patient. ","I can speak forever, but I think we don\u2019t have time, Angie.","Arvind Ramnani","It was very helpful. Just a quick follow-up, when you think of this nu-new, which encloses blockchain and AI, is the compositional work different? Do you have a higher mix of product based solutions or do you have a higher mix of consulting, how is the nature of your work different than the other stuff that you guys do?","Pierre Nanterme","It\u2019s always the same. When you\u2019re starting something new, it\u2019s rich if you will in terms of services, in terms of strategy, consulting, and high-end tech. That\u2019s the way you start. And when these new businesses are starting to mature in the (inaudible) if you will, then you add in more of the delivery services, more of the operations services coming behind. ","Take security services, for instance, we started with security strategy, identity, cyber threats, and we added managed security services. So, the nu-new is clearly more around the high-end tech, high-end consulting to bring the industry expertise, and this is what we see with to mention the three nu-new as you will know more again by the idea, I\u2019m doing a bit of advertising for the (inaudible) around immersive realities, blockchain technologies, and artificial intelligence and security services. So it\u2019s more on the consulting like high-end tech.","Operator","Next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Rod Bourgeois","A couple of questions on the margins, congrats on the revenue side. What\u2019s the trend in contract profitability in both consulting and outsourcing outside of the H&PS vertical?","David Rowland","Sequentially the trend is an improvement, and we expect sequentially the trend to continue to improve throughout the rest of the year. We\u2019re always focused on contract profitability. No matter what the result, we always want it to be better than it was, and that is certainly true in the second quarter. But sequentially it was a moderately improving trend.","Rod Bourgeois","Got it, and then can you give us David, a little more color on the puts and takes on your margin performance in the first half of the year. I\u2019m specifically interested in the year-over-year impact of acquisition related cost? But you\u2019ve also got bonus accrual and pricing and other factors. Can you call out any significant changes year-to-year on those trends?","David Rowland","Purely in the context of if you laid our first half results last year side-by-side with the first half results this year, really the two big impacts, and we always start with our segments. But the first big impact is H&PS, and if you look at H&PS and if you were to look at the rest of the Accenture business absent H&PS, in the first half of the year, absent H&PS, the rest of the Accenture business was flat in the first half of the year. ","On the other hand, if you look at our inorganic and if you were to look at the impact of inorganic in the P&L and you look at the side-by-side, the underlying business or, let\u2019s say the organic part of Accenture, the margins would\u2019ve expanded significantly in the first half of the year. And of course, that is our whole model is to expand the underlying profitability in order to absorb investments. And, for the full year, delivering consistent operating margins is a reflection of that.","Rod Bourgeois","Got it. So absent acquisitions, your margin expanded. And then on top of that, is there some added cost in the system because your growth accelerated? Is that an added cost or how do you look at that in terms of its impact?","David Rowland","Not really. Our business is growing rapidly and we\u2019re constantly in the talent market, bringing people on board. Maybe there\u2019s a little friction cost there, but it\u2019s just normal business. That\u2019s all within the space of our normal supply chain management and hiring activities.","Angie Park","Hey, Karen, we have time for one more question, and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","The last question will be from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Just maybe one more on H&PS, I just wanted to get a better understanding of what changed in the last quarter, because I know you talked about some renewals and then you talked about impact of acquisitions over the last 12 months. Those just sound like factors that we would\u2019ve been aware of maybe a quarter ago that there were some pending renewals as well as the deals that were already done. So maybe can you just walk us through what kind of changed as far as the underlying assumptions there that led us to where we are on the new outlook for full year margins?","David Rowland","Nothing materially changed for H&PS. The explanation of H&PS is in the context of a year-over-year comparison in the context of what we had expected this year. We had expected H&PS\u2019s profitability to be lower, and it\u2019s in the range of what we had expected. ","Our change in margin outlook for the year is really a reflection of a conscious decision we\u2019re making to create the right capacity to continue making investments in our business this year in order to continue to execute our strategy, and to do that while, at the same time, generating significant returns to our shareholders with strong market leading revenue growth, double-digit EPS growth, and strong market leading cash flow generation. ","So, everything is in the context of driving significant value to our shareholders and having the right investment capacity to position our business for the long run.","Jason Kupferberg","And then just quickly for my follow-up, are there any more renewals than average across your business that you see during the balance of fiscal \u201818? I know the pace of renewals can obviously vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. But is fiscal \u201818 a particularly high renewal year or no?","David Rowland","No. I don\u2019t think anything unusual in that regard.","Pierre Nanterme","Alright. It\u2019s time to wrap up, and thanks again for joining us today on this call. Just in closing, clearly we a strong momentum in our business, our market leading position in the new, we feel very confident in our ability to continue gaining market share and delivering value for our clients, our people, and our shareholders. ","We really look forward to talking with you again next quarter, and also to seeing many of you in person at our Investor and Analyst Conference, I mentioned many times in that call, in New York on April 25. In the meantime, if you have any questions or calls, please feel free to connect and call Angie and the team.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Angie Park. Please go ahead.","Angie Park","Thank you operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.","On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chief Executive Officer, and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call.","Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020.

Today we are very pleased to announce strong financial results for the first quarter, continuing our momentum from fiscal year \u201819. We are especially pleased with our revenue growth of 9% in local currency, well ahead of the market, which is broad-based across all dimensions of our business. We also delivered strong profitability and again returned substantial cash to our shareholders.","Our strong results across industries and geographic markets reflect the diversity and scale of Accenture's business around the world. We are very well-positioned to continue creating value for all our stakeholders. We're off to a great start in Q1 and we feel confident in our ability to deliver another strong year in fiscal \u201820. ","Now, let me hand it over to KC who will review the numbers in detail. ","KC McClure ","Thank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. ","We were very pleased with our Q1 results, which were strong across all dimensions of our business and position us well to achieve our full-year business outlook. Once again, the broad-based strength of our results demonstrates the durability of our business, the relevance of our services in the marketplace and our scale and leadership in the world\u2019s largest and key geographic markets.","Our results reflect very strong execution against our three financial imperatives for driving superior shareholder value. Revenue growth of 9% in local currency was well above the top end of our guided range for the quarter. Growth was broad based across all dimensions of our business, with the majority of industries growing at a high-single or double-digit rate. ","Results continue to be driven by strong double-digit growth in digital, cloud and security-related services, and our 9% growth represents continued market share gain as we extend our leadership position.","Our operating margin was 15.6% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. Importantly, we delivered this expansion while investing significantly in our people and in our business to position us for long-term market leadership. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.09, which represents 7% growth, which includes an FX headwind of about 2%. ","And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $692 million and returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $110 million in acquisitions in the quarter to bolster our skills and capabilities in strategic, high-growth areas of our business, and we expect to invest up to $1.6 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. ","Now, let me turn to some details for the quarter. New bookings were $10.3 billion. Consulting bookings were $6 billion, with a book-to-bill of 0.9. Outsourcing bookings were $4.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. This quarter our bookings continue to be well-balanced across the dimensions of our business and continue to be dominated by high demand for digital, cloud and security-related services, which we estimate represented more than 65% of our new bookings. ","Overall Q1 bookings landed in the range that we expected, and followed our historical pattern of lower bookings in the first quarter. As you know, quarterly bookings can be lumpy, and looking forward we have a strong pipeline and expect strong bookings in Q2. ","Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $11.4 billion, a 7% increase in U.S. dollars and nine percent in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.4 billion up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $5.0 billion, up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency.","Looking at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our dimensions; technology Services and strategy and consulting services, both posted strong high single-digit growth and operations continued its trend of double-digit growth for the 24th consecutive quarter. ","Taking a closer look at our operating groups. H&PS grew 13% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in both health and public service, including double-digit growth in North America and growth markets and strong growth in Europe. ","Products grew 12%, reflecting continued strength in our largest operating group, with double-digit growth in life sciences and consumer goods, retail and travel services. We continue to see strong demand for our services across all three geographies. Resources grew 7% in the quarter, with double-digit growth in energy and strong growth in utilities. Overall, we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and gross markets. ","Communications, Media and Technology delivered 7% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth in software and platforms, with double-digit growth in Europe and strong growth in gross markets. Finally, Financial Services grew 6% this quarter. Insurance again grew double-digits and we saw continued improvement in banking and capital markets globally. ","Overall, Financial Services delivered double-digit growth in growth markets and strong growth in North America, partially offset by contraction in Europe. We expect to see continued challenges and banking capital markets in Europe and the near-term. ","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I am very pleased with the continued demand across all three of our geographic markets, which illustrates the diversity of our business which continues to serve us well. ","In North America we delivered 9% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe revenue grew 7% in local currency with double-digit growth in Italy, Germany and Ireland and high single-digit growth in France. And we delivered another very strong quarter in growth markets with 13% growth in local currency led by Japan, which again had very strong double-digit growth. We also had double-digit growth in Brazil and Singapore. ","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared with 31.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.1% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were 6.1% compared to 5.6% for the same quarter last year.","Operating income was $1.8 billion for the first quarter, reflecting a 15.6% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter one last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 19.8% for the first quarter last year. ","Diluted earnings per share were $2.09 compared with EPS of $1.96 in the first quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 43 days compared to 40 days last quarter and 42 days in the first quarter of last year. ","Free cash flow for the quarter was $692 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $787 million, net of property and equipment additions of $95 million, and our cash balance at November 30th was $5.8 billion compared with $6.1 billion at August 31st. ","With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter we repurchased or redeemed 3.8 million shares for $729 million at an average price of $189.65 per share. At November 30 we had approximately 3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","Also in November we paid our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share for a total of $508 million. This represents a 10% increase over the equivalent, quarterly rate last year and our Board of Directors declared our second quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share to be paid on February 14, also a 10% increase over the equivalent quarterly rate last year. ","So in summary, we were very pleased with our Q1 results and we are off to a good start in fiscal \u201820. ","Now, let me turn it back to Julie.","Julie Sweet","Thank you KC. Our first-quarter performance reflects continued strong demand for our services, as well as the disciplined execution of our growth strategy. Accenture is uniquely positioned to partner with our clients to successfully achieve transformation across the enterprise. ","We have unparalleled technology capabilities and ecosystem partnerships, deep industry and function expertise, a focus on continuous innovation, digital at scale and incredibly talented people. We create value for our clients from building out their digital core to helping them innovate across their growth agenda and realize significant value from optimizing their operations.","\u2018The New\u2019 digital, cloud and security is now our core, accounting for about 65% of total revenues, and we are focused on continuous innovation across these services. In cloud for example, we have more than 300 patents and pending patent applications. We have 90,000 cloud professionals and are the leading global partner of Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. And I am very pleased that we just launched MyNAP, a groundbreaking new platform to help clients accelerate their cloud transformation. ","Identifying the right cloud solutions can be complicated, so the key is stimulating and testing a scaled-up model to quantify value and build the business case, giving clients confidence in the potential benefits so they can move forward quickly. This is just another great example of our continuous innovation mindset and how we drive speed to value for our clients. ","Over the past few months, I have been spending time in many of our key geographic markets around the world, meeting with our clients, our people and our ecosystem partners. We have scale in every major market and we are the leader, number one in both North America and Europe and number three in growth markets where we continue to rapidly gain market share. As an example, we have reached scale in China with more than 17,000 people, and this is a key strategic market for us and our Global Clients. ","Let me double-click on our major markets. Our eight largest countries as we move around the world; the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Germany, France and Spain and Europe and Japan and Australia in the growth markets. These countries account for nearly 80% of our revenues and they all generate $1 billion or more in annual revenues. They also are home to more than 85% of our 200 diamond clients, our largest relationships with the world's leading companies. ","Our extensive global presence has always positioned us uniquely in the market to deliver best-in-class global programs for the largest multinational companies. And today it has created yet another competitive advantage, which is the ability to create value at speed and scale by leveraging our global expertise tailored to the local context. ","Leveraging our global network of more than 100 innovation hubs that we have built over the last few years, we can bring innovation from every corner of the world to our clients. And while the theme of transformation is common across the globe, it plays out at the intersection of industry technology and geography. We see growing and significant differences by country, while at the same time our global footprint gives us the opportunity to leverage our learnings and our talent from around the world to accelerate outcomes for our clients. ","Let me bring this to life with a few examples from our Resources business. The ways in which energy is produced, consumed and distributed are changing dramatically. But the shape and pace of the change and the opportunities for Accenture are different around the world. In Europe, we are working with clients in France and Italy to help them succeed in the transition to a low carbon economy. For Engie, the French Multinational Utility company, we are teaming with sales force and velocity, which we have a minority investment on a global unified CRM platform for more than 15,000 employees. ","The new platform gives Engie a common intelligent view of its customers across more than 70 countries and empowers employees to strengthen customer relationships and provide personalized recommendations to support Engie\u2019s new zero-carbon transition strategy for the Fortune Global 500. ","In Italy we are collaborating with Snam, which operates the largest gas transmission network in Europe, to identify Internet-of-Things technologies on the Microsoft Azure platform, leveraging connected devices, as well as machine learning, artificial intelligence and advanced analytics to optimize the monitoring and maintenance of energy infrastructure to make it smarter and more sustainable, as well as more efficient. ","In the United States we are working with Southern Company, the gas and electric utilities, which is building the first new nuclear reactor in the U.S. in 30-years. Partnering with Southern Company, Accenture built the new cloud-based construction work management system on the Amazon GovCloud platform from scratch in just six months. This enabled Southern Company to expand and accelerate plant construction as it strives to bring this clean carbon-free energy production online for 500,000 homes and businesses. ","Let me pause for a moment and take a step back. Each of these examples demonstrates the power of our unique business model, which spans services from strategy to operations, with digital and technology at the core. This enables us to create the multidisciplinary teams that are needed to not just create a vision of transformation, but to execute and scale and give our clients the confidence that they will achieve real value. ","If you think about the environment our clients are navigating, unprecedented change, the need for speed and major investments to drive their enterprise transformation, our unique model and capabilities give us an incredible competitive advantage to be the partner of choice for the world's leading companies.","Now, let me turn to Accenture\u2019s greatest and undeniable strength, which is our people. During the first quarter the number of Accenture people surpassed 500,000, a significant milestone. I want to thank each and every one of them for their incredible commitment and dedication to serving our clients. ","As always, we continue to strengthen our leadership team, which now includes more than 8,000 Managing Directors. I was delighted that earlier this month we promoted 787 new Managing Directors and Senior Managing Directors, including a record 260 new women Managing Directors, accounting for 36% of the promotions to this level. ","And before I turn it back to KC, I just want to mention some of the great recognition we have recently received for our long-term success and cutting-edge capabilities. We are especially proud that Droga5, which joined Accenture Interactive last April was named Agency of the Decade by Adweek, which characterize Droga5 as a dominating creative force. ","Interbrand ranked Accenture number 31% on its list of top global brands, our highest ranking ever. Our brand value increased 14% for the second year in a row, and I want to recognize Amy Fuller, our Chief Marketing Officer, her team and all our people for this great work to continually strengthen the Accenture brands. ","With that, I will turn it over to KC to provide our updated fiscal \u201820 business outlook. KC? ","KC McClure ","Thanks Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal \u201820 we expect revenues to be in the range of $10.85 billion to $11.15 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 1% compared to the second-quarter fiscal \u201819 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. ","For the full fiscal year \u201920, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our result in U.S. dollars, will be approximately negative 1% compared to fiscal \u201819. But for the full fiscal \u201820 we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 6% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal \u201819. ","For operating margin we continue to expect fiscal year \u201820 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis-point expansion over fiscal \u201819 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 22.5% in fiscal \u201819. ","For earnings per share, we now expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal \u201820 to be in the range of $7.66 to $7.84 or 4% to 7% growth over fiscal \u201819 results. For fiscal \u201820 we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.75 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion. ","Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. ","With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Angie? ","Angie Park ","Thanks KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask the question. ","Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead. ","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning guys and happy holidays! I just wanted to ask a question on acquisitions. I think KC you mentioned you are expecting to spend up to about $1.6 billion on acquisitions this year. Can you just give a little bit more color on the expected contribution to revenue growth this year from acquisitions and then also what you're, you know what your focus areas are for M&A? Thank you. ","KC McClure","Yes, sure. So happy holidays to you to Lisa. In terms of our expected contribution to revenue in full fiscal year \u201820 from inorganic, we continue to expect it to be about 2%, which was in line of what we also had last year. And in terms of focus areas, I\u2019m going to hand it over to Julie. ","Julie Sweet","Great! Let me give you a color. So happy holiday to you too Lisa and thanks for joining us. So our acquisition strategy continues to be centered really around three focused sales \u2013 focus areas. The first is scaling in the hot skill areas where we see a big market opportunity. The second is continuing to add skills and capabilities in The New. And then the third is deepening our industry and functional expertise. And as you might imagine, acquisitions don't always fit exactly into one of those three; they often cross those. So let me just give you like a little bit of sense of just the three that we just announced in the last few months. ","So if you start in the U.S., we announced that we're buying, we're acquiring Clarity Insights, which is a leading provider of data science and applied intelligence capabilities. They are very focused on three industries; Healthcare and Financial \u2013 banking capital markets and insurance, which are priority areas for us globally and in particular in the U.S. And at the same time they bring with them accelerators that will help us bring more speed to value for our clients,","and they are focused on one of our most important markets, so they are helping us scale where we already have scale, but it's a very hot area in Applied Intelligence, because it really crosses our services. ","Then if you move around the world and go to Europe, Silveo which we announced and expect to close actually just in a couple of days which is headquartered in London, they are a company that's focused on supply chain and manufacturing and particularly solutions on SAP and Dassault Systems which are both important partners. And so they are very much a part of our industry X.O strategy and at the same time providing scale and functional expertise in core areas for us; SAP, Dassault Systems and supply chain. ","And then if you move again around the world to China, where I was just there a few weeks ago, we're really excited about future move automotive. I actually spent a few hours there myself, really touching and feeling the work that they're doing and they are digital and mobility service provider for the automotive industry in China, incredibly advanced right, working with leading automakers there and what's so exciting is not only does this acquisition help us really partner with our clients in China, but they are advanced services and what they are doing with the connected car is something we\u2019ll be able to leverage and bring as innovation all around the world, because we have important clients who are not only operating in China, but in the U.S. and Europe. ","And so that just sort of gives you a flavor and as you can probably tell, I'm so enthusiastic about what our team is delivering here, because it's very much targeted on making an impact close to clients in our markets around the world, but also bringing us skills that we can leverage around the world. ","Lisa Ellis","Terrific! Thank you. And then maybe just for my follow-up, I know this is the time of year you are in a lot of discussions with clients around your 2020 programs with them. What are you seeing that's going to be different about 2020 in terms of the types of work you are doing with clients compared to 2019? Thanks. ","Julie Sweet","It's very much more of the same in the sense of enterprise-wide transformation and then a focus on innovation, particularly around the growth agenda, and then continuing to optimize operations, and that really, that's been the theme and it continues to be the theme. In fact, I think since September 1 I've met with over 100 C-suite executives, and I'm very confident of \u2013 that we have a pulse on the demand and that we have the capabilities they need.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. ","Joseph Foresi","Hi! I wondered if we could talk about the cadence on bookings. I know that we\u2019ve \u2013 and you said many times in the past that it can be lumpy. We saw it a little bit light ending I guess this quarter. So maybe you could talk about how you see the cadence and what we should expect from a seasonality perspective. ","KC McClure","Yes sure. Hey Jos, thanks for joining. Yes, so you're right, you've heard us talk about \u2013 and you know us very well. You know that our history of bookings, you do see lumpiness. And I think really the most important thing and that's within that is that we're very pleased with the demand for our services in the marketplace, and if you think about that in the backdrop of bookings. ","So we're coming off a quarter, Q4, which was our records bookings quarter, and that was a record by more than $1 billion. We had strong bookings that came in the range that we expected in quarter one, right, and we talked about that last quarter. We tend to have it seasonally, lower quarter in one, so again this met our expectations, and that very importantly we have a strong pipeline and we see strong bookings in quarter two. ","And I think the other part of demand that's important, and you saw this in our results in the first quarter as well, is that we have broad-based demand in our revenue, right, and we far exceeded the upper end of our guidance by more than $160 million. So you would see that bookings demand \u2013 you see the demand in the market coming through our bookings, both in terms of what we've done last quarter, bookings coming in the range that we expected this quarter, a strong pipeline with strong bookings expected in quarter two, as well as broad-based, over-delivery of our expected range in the first quarter in revenue, which allowed us to increase our revenue range for the year.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about your expectations from a demand perspective across the verticals and the geographies. I\u2019m particularly interested in Financial Services and what's going on with the European banks, but any color you know from a very high level across those geos and verticals would be very helpful? And happy holidays as well. ","Julie Sweet","Hi Joe, this is Julie. Happy holidays! So maybe just kind of going across, let me just start with Financial Services, right. So on the Financial Services side, as you say Europe continues to be a challenging market in the industry and for us, and so we expect that we're going to continue to face challenges there, particularly in the UKI right. But overall our Financial Services business, if you look at North America and the growth markets, you know it remains robust, right. But we continue to expect challenges in Europe. ","If you just look at \u2013 take it up a little [ph] across the dimensions of our business and our industries, North America delivered very strong results. We are seeing continued momentum there. We have a very strong business in Europe, and so while we've got pockets of pressure in Financial Services and the other area I would call out in Europe is we have seen pressure in industry and automotive. But otherwise Europe remains a strong business, and in fact 12 out of 13 of our industries this quarter had positive growth. ","And then the growth markets keep being strong really across-the-board. The only other place of pressure that I would call out was in North America, we did also see not surprisingly some pressure in industry and automotive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang ","Thanks, good morning. Good revenue acceleration here. I wanted to first ask on gross margin expansion. Actually it's one of the largest increases we've seen in some time looking at the model here. Would you attribute that large expansion to and then same thing on SG&A, that spend was up, can we assume that that's driving some prospecting and deal pursuit costs given your positive comments on bookings? ","KC McClure","Yeah, so thanks for the question and hello Tien-tsin. In terms of how we look at our business as you all know, we first always start with looking at operating margin, and because the way our payroll costs works as you well know Tien-tsin, based on the activities that we have people doing from quarter-to-quarter and the demand that we see in the marketplace, you can see differences in the different segments of our income statement. ","So as it relates to the gross margin increase this quarter, it is tied to the sales and market, what's happening in sales and marketing, where we have more people out working our pipeline. So that will help our gross margin, and then you'll see the offsetting impact in sales and marketing. And you're right, that does tie in to the statements we've made of having \u2013 continuing to have a very strong pipeline. ","Tien-tsin Huang ","Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. KC, real quick if you don\u2019t mind. Just on the consulting revenue growth, that has been improving here and I guess widening the gap to your consulting bookings growth or pattern. What explains the faster conversion? Thanks for the second question, I appreciate it. ","A - KC McClure","Yes, so we really haven't seen any change in conversion Tien-tsin of our overall bookings, just overall to revenue. You know that can be within a range and that can vary. So as we look at what we've done in consulting bookings, we feel very good with our bookings for the quarter, as well as our pipeline, and see also strong bookings in quarter two as well in consulting. ","Then if you look at what our \u2013 production of our bookings in relation to revenue, you know we look at that over a prolonged period of time, and so we're still in the zone that we like, which is a book-to-bill ratio of about one point.","A - Julie Sweet","Yes, and Tien-Tsin hi. Hello! Nice to talk to you. And I would say, you know as we talked about last quarter, you know from the revenue side we are very pleased with mid-to-high single-digit growth and you're going to have some quarters here in mid, you have some quarters here in the high-growth, that's the zone we want to be in, because the context for our strategy and consulting business, you need to look at it in the context of our overall business. ","You know big drivers of growth are the fact that we can bring together these multi-disciplinary teams to drive enterprise-wide transformations, right. That is our huge competitive advantage. It's the demand that we see in the market, right, and it's our ability to actually go from strategy to operations, to feel these teams that really is what drives big growth in our business and of course that at the core we've got the digital and technology. ","So we look at our strategy and consulting business in the context of the needs we are trying to fulfill for our clients, which are very much around these multidisciplinary teams that span our services, which frankly nobody else can do, right, at our scale. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ","Darrin Peller ","Thanks guys. You know it's amazing to see the headcount, where it is right now, and so if you could just quickly comment on you know your thoughts on talent management and going forward from this kind of a level, your ability to hire what you need, what you've always been obviously extremely strong at, and then maybe just comment on the linearity and the model now; maybe looking forward given where you are around the new and the type of revenue?","Julie Sweet","Sure. I mean maybe just to start with, you know our philosophy right around people and size, because you know every time we hit a milestone, it's always \u2018can you keep doing it? Are you able to get the people?\u2019 and so first of all our philosophy is that we can continue to grow in size as long as what our people are doing is the high-value work that drives our financial objectives, right, and so we're very focused on what our people are doing versus how many people we have, because the size part of it is about our ability to manage and we're really good at that, right. ","Like over the years we've made the adjustments, we've done the things we need to do to focus on our clients and our people, and so the big focus for us is on what our people are doing, which ties to the demand that we see in the market, right. ","We are early innings of digital transformation, enterprise-wide transformation. We are constantly seeing new emerging tech. You know for example, we're doing some great work with [Inaudible] Japan where we're putting in one of the most significant early examples of using block-chain to drive their business or creating a platform that allows their customers to access other financial products. That's very new cutting-edge, right, we're still at the beginning. So we see the demand for these new high-value services still quite early. ","Then you look at the model itself. We don't see the model today as being linear. I mean one of the things that people often talk about is well, you\u2019re continuing to grow. But underneath that is we've been automating; we've been using people and their talents differently. I mean we often talk about the automation in our operations business where there, we actually didn't let people go. We automated and then up-skilled them to do the higher-value work, but not just in operations, but if you look at our other assets. ","So we are constantly \u2013 we don't have a linear model today, because we are constantly doing what we're doing for our clients, is leveraging technology to change the mixture of how we are using tech and our people to again continue to focus on the higher-value services, and so you know we are \u2013 and hopefully that gives you kind of the color for how we think about our model. ","Darrin Peller ","Yeah, no that is helpful. Just a quick follow-up is on pricing. I mean again, it seems like as you've trained your people to do the higher part of the food chain, you are able to pass that through. Any changes on that pattern or has pricing held up, just given competition has also picked up for digital. Thanks guys. ","KC McClure","Yeah, so pricing \u2013 you know the environment for pricing remains competitive, right, and that's always the nature of the work that we do. Now within that, we are able to see pricing differentiation in areas where we're differentiated, where we've invested, and we do continue to see that we have pricing improvement in some areas of our business continuing in this quarter. It\u2019s a constant focus for us and that really is the key part of \u2013 the key first lever to really driving our margin expansion pricing. So we are always \u2013 we always have been and will always continue to be focused on driving pricing that's the right value for the client and for Accenture. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Harshita Rawat ","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about industry X.O. It's a relatively new business for you and somewhat early innings, so can you talk about the journey in Interactive which was a new business for many, many years ago and now a huge revenue contributor. So can you talk about that journey, the lessons there and how you plan to go about scaling Industry X.O. Thank you. ","A - Julie Sweet","Thanks Harshita, that's a great question, and we often you know internally talk about the analogies, because you'll remember with Accenture Interactive, that growth came from a mixture of both, inorganic and organic, and very much fueled though by the power of Accenture. So even as we were bringing in, as we've been bringing in skills and capabilities that we didn't have traditionally like a Droga5 and before them Monkeys and Kalorama [ph], these creative agencies, the value proposition for our clients is to take these other capabilities and pair them with the traditional strengths of Accenture for example on building digital platforms, and that is what has been able to drive the growth in Accenture Interactive. ","And as we look at Industry X.O, this is an opportunity for us to serve areas of the company that we serve today, but not as much at scale. Just like with Accenture Interactive we weren't as relevant to the CMO as we are today. Once we've built Accenture Interactive as well as you know new business creation and Industry X.O. ","Well, of course we have served and we have practiced, you know still significant practices in manufacturing and supply chain, Industry X.O is really about the digitization of manufacturing, the creation of connective products, and then also these digital platforms and engineering around the software. ","And while again we're in \u2013 just like Accenture Interactive when we began were in parts of these, what we're doing is we're adding the complementary skills that will allow us to take the power of Accenture and really scale and bring all of that to our clients who themselves are going through a whole change, because manufacturing is now being digitizing and it's the convergence of IT with operating technology, and we expect to grow Industry X.O as we have with Accenture Interactive through a combination of organic and inorganic. ","So you saw us last year buy companies like Mindtribe and Pillar in the U.S., which are all about connected products. We saw the future move acquisition I just mentioned in China, which is about automotive and Connected Services; Silveo in London, which is just the recent, and that's really about digitizing, manufacturing, leveraging our ecosystems. ","But at the same time we're building on the scaled digital and technology capabilities, which is what our clients need to do as we all go through, where we see this transformation to digitize these areas of the company that haven't been digitized in the same way that you have the customer front-end. ","Harshita Rawat ","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. ","David Koning","Maybe my first question, just when we look back at some of the metrics you've given around The New you know in the percent of total revenue and we go back a couple of years, it looks like that was drilling 20% to 30% and some of the legacy was declining maybe low double. Today it looks like The New might be growing low-to-mid teens and legacy has actually kind of improved to maybe slightly declining. I\u2019m just wondering that pace of change, you know what might be driving that and if that's even the right way to think about it. ","KC McClure","Yeah, hi Dave. So in terms of looking at The New, I think really what you're touching on is the growth rates that we've had over the last few years and we continue to have very strong growth rates in The New. And as you look at that scale right of our business, I mean you would anticipate that even very strong growth rates would slow a bit, but again be very strong just based on scale. ","And if you look at the other portion of our business, let's call it the non-New or the core, we continue to see that that is stabilizing; it's been decreasing at about a mid-single digit rate and that's by design, that's our strategy, but it's been pretty consistent over the last few quarters.","David Koning","Great, thanks! And just one quick follow-up just on accounting. There was another income line in Q1 that was about $11 million positive this quarter. Last year that line was about $25 million to $35 million negative all through the year. Was there a one-time item in Q1 and does that more normalize the rest of the year. ","KC McClure","Yeah, so we did have this quarter a small benefit below operating income where we had, we indeed do have non-operating income this quarter as opposed to what you saw in quarter one of last year, which was non-operating expense. So as a reminder last year, we adopted a new revenue - a new accounting standard that require that we marked our investments to fair market value, and while we don't have a large investment portfolio, what you will see Dave from time-to-time that may cause a little bit more variability in what we have a non-operating income and non-operating expense. ","In this quarter we did have a gain in non-operating income on some of our investments and that was offset by some FX losses as well, but it was a net gain this quarter in non-operating areas and it will fluctuate probably slightly more than it has in the past, really just because of that accounting change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the beat and the upside surprise. For you guys was it in consulting in particular, because I know a lot of investors were concerned consulting was weakening and actually it strengthened. So just trying to figure out if that also surprised you guys or was there something else that created the upside.","KC McClure","Yeah, so we were really pleased overall with our revenue growth rate for this quarter Bryan, and obviously at 9% growth, which was as you mentioned a beat, $160 million higher than we expected. But the other thing that we were very pleased with is the fact that it was also a broad-based over-delivery. ","Now if I had to point out two areas in particular, I'd point to health and public service, particularly in North America, which was strong both in the health, industry, as well in the public sector industry and that's a statement overall for North America including our federal practice. And then also products that continue to have very good [ph] in life sciences, as well as consumer goods, retail and travel. ","And so what you'll see is that we do and we continue to expect Bryan that we will have for the full-year consulting in the mid-to-high single-digits growth and outsourcing also in the mid to high single growth rate. ","Julie Sweet","Yes, and Bryan I would just add \u2013 this is Julie, that again as I talked about earlier, although obviously we look at strategy and consulting, tech services and operations separately and report on that, you know remember that our focus really has been because of the demand we see in the market, on our unique business model that brings these services together, and so it's not so much. You know you can't really \u2013 for us the way we manage our business, it's not that wait, there's a big surprise in strategy consulting, because KC's giving the answer around industries and clients because a lot of our work is actually bringing all of these services together to meet the needs we're seeing in the market. ","And so while we do report this to give you that insight into the types of work, when we are thinking about what's happening it's much more focused, it is only focused on clients, what are their needs, and how are we bringing these services together. And that really is the power of Accenture, is that we're able to bring these services together. ","And if you think about what our clients need right now, I mean as I said, I literally in the last four months, almost four months spent time with over a 100 C-Suite executives and top of mind for them is the importance of making sure they are going to get value. And that's why they want to partner with us, is because we're bringing the teams and we're able to really give them confidence in outcomes and we're able to point to the execution we've done with other clients and demonstrate the value, and that we're bringing that learning. ","And I think particularly as we see this inflection in the marketplace, moving from pilots and use cases to this enterprise-wide transformation, multiyear programs, it's more important than ever that we're able to bring these services together for our clients.","Bryan Keane","That's helpful and just as a follow-up on Europe, it was up 7% constant currency; I think that's up from four last quarter. Again a lot of investor concern around Europe, but you guys are showing an acceleration there. You talked about I think 12 of 13 industries showed improvement. So I guess I'm a little surprised to hear about that improvement. Can you just talk about broadly what's going on in Europe and why you are seeing that improvement?","KC McClure","Yeah, and I will maybe just reiterate a couple of the points, and some of that you also mentioned. So we were pleased with our business in Europe this quarter and we did have broad-based growth and it wasn't 12 of the 13 industries. And importantly it was high single to double-digit growth and nine out of that 13, and so that's really important to us, and that's something that we're very focused on and we're very proud of, the overall broad-based nature of our business in Europe and the diversity that we have. Then I think you'll see it has been and continues to provide some durability in that market. ","Now as we've mentioned, you know we do continue to have a focus on banking capital markets in Europe and that's particularly in the UK. So we do have some more work to do in that area, and as also as Julie mentioned, we do have some pressure in industrials and the automotive as well in Europe. But I just would point back to the double-digit growth that we Italy, Germany and Ireland as well. And so we're very focused on continuing in that market to drive the transformation that Julie was talking about, the she sees and talks with all the C-Suite about in her travels throughout the world. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Julie you mentioned Droga5, I\u2019m going to take you up on that one. Obviously Accenture spent many years growing the various parts of that business, steadily expanding from the technology part creative. Droga5 recently won The Kimberly-Clark Childcare account and based on our checks, you are increasingly going head on with the traditional agencies for what I'd call the whole shooting match. Can you speak to what you're seeing there specifically and whether you think your missing any pieces, so you could go when full accounts end-to-end what the traction you currently have there is?","Julie Sweet","Sure. Well, Kimberly-Clark is a great example of what we see is the demand in the market, which is for a company to bring together not only world-class creative, but the digital capabilities, as well as the advisory capabilities to truly transform the customer experience, right. And you\u2019ll hear that term now a lot. We believe we're the only company today that actually has all of the capabilities that are needed in order to deliver a very different customer experience. ","And so while I know you think of it as going up straight against the agencies, what we think about it is what the clients are looking for is not just the creative agency and you see that in the industry as the industry, the broader creative industry is also expanding into these capabilities. ","The fact of the matter is very difficult to have creative, it's equally difficult to have depth and breadth in the digital and technology capabilities that our clients need, and so we believe that our competitive advantage here is to have such strong creative capabilities coupled with, like just unparalleled digital and technology capabilities at a huge scale in every major market. Because remember Accenture Interactive, we have built around the world, right, and we've got it \u2013 you know and I was in the studios in China, we have it in Australia, across Europe, as well as the U,S. ","So we're extremely proud of the work that Accenture Interactive under the leadership of Bryan Whipple, but his entire team have done, that its powered by the rest of Accenture, right, all of these skills and capabilities. That is very hard for anyone to replicate in our view. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it, makes sense. The second question is, you mentioned the incremental elements of nonlinearity in the model in the prior question on headcount and revenue growth. What's the longer-term impact on margins and cash flow; if I can extend that question to those metrics? ","KC McClure","So Ashwin, in terms of how we think about those two elements, right. In terms of margin, I think it's important to just point out that we always continue to look for modest margin expansion. But more importantly to us is that we're doing more than just the modest margin expansion as you well know that goes to our bottom line. We are doing more underlying margin expansion, so that we can invest at scale in our people and in our business for long-term market leadership, so that's a key part. ","And on free cash flow, you know that continues to be \u2013 you know there's no change there. I mean this year you\u2019ll see that we managed that part of our business by looking at free cash flow to net income ratio, right, and this year again it's 1.1% to 1.2%. And as you think about that, while I won't guide for that long term, you know strong free cash flow will continue to be an anchor of how we run Accenture. ","Angie Park ","Okay, and operator we have time for one more question and then Julie will wrap up the call. ","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Bryan Bergin ","Hi, good morning, thank you. I wanted to ask a question on how the mix of your client counterparts have changed. So if we think about enterprise budgets, can you give me a sense of how your revenue stream currently maps across an organization, whether it's CIO or the CMO budget or like board-level initiatives. And the reason I ask this, we\u2019ve diversified the business so much over the last several years. I'm just really curious how this has evolved and how you really are mapping across the various budgets now today? ","KC McClure","Well, I guess what I'd say is, if you think about what we're doing with respect to, you know for example Accenture Interactive, that work is almost always a combination of marketing plus-CIO, often plus the business units right, because the work is not \u2013 you know really is around customer experience and so where the budget sits really varies by company, and some companies you'll have budget sit with the Chief Digital Officer right. So what we \u2013 our focus is less on the specific budgets and more how are we serving the different needs of the enterprise. ","So if you just \u2013 and remember we go back to really \u2013 we think about it in three things; building the digital core, so 40% of our business growing double-digit today is in our intelligent platform services our five big platforms, because that's all about next-gen platforms right. Similarly our cloud business is there. ","Then we have the optimizing operations, so you've got a $6 billion scaled business growing high single-digit to double-digit, right, which is all about optimizing and making sure that within the functions, as well as industries they've got access to the best technologies in a most efficient way. ","And then on top of that you have the growth agenda like Accenture Interactive which is $10 billion. We announced last quarter with strong growth, as well as the new areas like connected products and services. And so we continue to focus \u2013 our big next focus area is Industry X.O, which is growing on our historic work and manufacturing and supply chain to the new and really going after that part of the enterprise along with the market, because that's not digitized as fast to say customer experience and that's really how we think about the business. ","Bryan Bergin ","Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, I heard your inorganic 2% you expect for fiscal \u201920, was that close for that in 1Q as well? And happy holidays! ","KC McClure","Yeah, Happy holidays to you too Bryan. I mean we look at that over a full year. So I would say you know 2% inorganic for the full-year is the number that I would continue to focus on. ","Julie Sweet","Okay, thanks Bryan. So thanks everyone again for joining us on today's call. We are very pleased with our strong start in fiscal \u201820 as you've just heard and we are well-positioned to achieve our updated business outlook for the year. We will stay laser-focused on continuing our current momentum, capturing the opportunities in the marketplace and creating value for our clients and all of our stakeholders. ","I want to wish you all, our investors and analysts and everyone at Accenture and your families all the best for the New Year. And finally, I want to thank each of our people around the world, you are what makes Accenture unique and special. I will see everyone on the road.

We are extremely pleased with our strong financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Our excellent fourth quarter performance continues the momentum we have been building in our business all year. For the full year, we delivered strong new bookings, generated record revenues, grew EPS faster than revenues and generated strong free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in our business and delivering significant value for clients and shareholders. Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $34.4 billion, we grew revenues 11% in local currency to a record $31 billion, our growth was broad-based across the business including double-digit growth in four of our five operating groups and all three geographic regions. We delivered earnings per share of $4.82 on an adjusted basis, a 7% increase.","We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 14.5% on an adjusted basis; we generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We returned $3.8 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, an 8% increase over our prior dividend. So, I feel very good about what we delivered in fiscal year 2015. Our outstanding performance clearly demonstrates that we continue to provide highly relevant and differentiated services to all clients.","Now, let me hand over to David. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you Pierre and thanks all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter four which culminated an extremely strong year for Accenture. Once again, our results reflect our unique position in the marketplace, the relevance of our growth strategy and our ability to drive our business to produce value for our clients, our people, and our shareholders. As you listened to our prepared remarks, you\u2019ll hear continued consistency in the key business drivers and three overriding themes; durability of revenue growth, sustainable margin expansion, and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation.","Before getting into the details, I'd like to emphasize a few highlights in each of these areas. Revenue momentum continued with very strong local currency growth of 12% even against our toughest quarterly compare of the year. A key characteristic was our balanced growth across our operating groups, our geographic regions, and our five businesses which speak of the durability of our growth strategy. Our rate of growth continued to outpace the market as we gained share in most dimensions of our business. Driving profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion continues to be our focus. And in the fourth quarter, our operating margin came in as expected and consistent with last year. For the full year, we delivered 20 basis points of margin expansion on an adjusted basis, while investing significantly to position our business for long-term market leadership. And finally, we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow, $1.4 billion in free cash flow to be specific.","In terms of capital allocation, it's noteworthy that we closed 11 acquisitions in the quarter. Given us 18 acquisitions for the full year, we\u2019ve invested capital of $800 million providing us with scale and capabilities in key growth areas. So we finished the year much like we started with strong broad-based growth underpinned by very good profitability and cash flows. With those summary comments, let me now turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.8 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.1 billion reflecting a book-a-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $4.7 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3."," We're very pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter, especially considering the FX headwind which we estimate to be 13% in the quarter. The overall demand for our services remains robust, with the strongest quarterly bookings growth coming from operations, products, Europe and the growth markets. Across the board, digital-related services continued to be an important driver of our new bookings. We also had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, bringing the total for the year to 43, which again signifies the unique relationship that we have with many of the largest companies in the world.","Turning to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.9 billion, 1% increase in USD and 12% in local currency reflecting a negative 10% foreign exchange impact consistent with the assumption we provided in June. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% in USD and 14% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 1% in USD and an increase of 9% in local currency. The overriding theme in quarter four continued to be broad-based and balanced growth across our operating groups and geographic regions, more pleased with revenue performance across all of our business dimensions with the dominant drivers continuing to be strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and operations. But we were also very pleased with our growth in application services and the combined growth for strategy and consulting.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology led all operating groups with 16% growth, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, broad-based growth continued with double-digit growth across all three industries and in all three geographic areas. Financial Services delivered their strongest growth of the year at 14% fueled by double-digit growth in all three industries, and in both Europe and the growth markets. H&PS continued their trend of double-digit growth posting 13% in the quarter. The strength of our H&PS business continues to be very strong growth in both health and public service in North America. Products grew by 10%, led by consumer goods and services, life sciences and automotive, with very strong growth in Europe and the growth markets. And finally, resources continue to deliver very consistent growth of 6% in the quarter with positive growth in all three geographic regions and in all industries except energy.","Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.7% consistent with the same period last year. So the marketing expense for the quarter was 11.7% of net revenues, down 10 basis points. General and administrative expense was 6.2% of net revenues, up 10 basis points. Operating margin (sic) [income] was 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter reflecting a 13.9% operating margin consistent with quarter four last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 30.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. Net income was $788 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $760 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.15 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter of last year. This reflects a 6% year-over-year increase.","Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continued to be industry leading. There were 37 days consistent with last quarter. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.4 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.5 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $148 million. Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at August 31st was $4.4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31st last year, down roughly $500 million as we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in fiscal \u201915. Turning to some other key operational metrics, we continue to attract significant talent, hiring more than 100,000 people in fiscal '15, ending the year with a global headcount of over 358,000 people. We now have approximately 257,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter four, our utilization was 90%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition which excludes involuntary terminations was 14% compared to 15% in quarter three and in the same period last year.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.6 million shares for $664 million at an average price of $100.03 per share. For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 27.4 million shares for approximately $2.5 billion at a average price of $89.52 per share. This week, our Board of Directors approved $5 billion of additional share repurchase authority bringing the total to $7.6 billion. And as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 13 and represents an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. So before I turn it back over to Pierre, let me just briefly summarize where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September.","I'm pleased to say that we successfully managed our business and delivered on every metric in our original outlook. New bookings for the full year landed at $34.4 billion, which was just above the upper end of our guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Net revenues grew 11% for the year in local currency, above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 14.5% reflecting 20 basis points of expansion, the midpoint of our guided range. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $4.82, which was above the upper end of our original guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Free cash flow was $3.7 billion, in the middle of our original guided range even with a much higher FX headwind.","And finally, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders right at our initial objective through $1.4 billion in dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by 2%.","So, again, we had an extremely strong year by any measure. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in executing our growth strategy and especially as it relates to the accelerated rotation of our business to digital-related services. Overall, our results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders ","With that, let me turn it back to Pierre. ","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. Our excellent results for the year reflect the successful execution of our strategy across the different dimensions of our business. We are making focused investments in high growth areas including more than $2.5 billion in acquisitions over the last three years. These investments are all about building new capabilities to further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. At the same time, we have aligned our organization around five businesses; Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations, all highly competitive in their own rights and synergistic in delivering end-to-end outcomes for clients.","In particular, the new innovative services we have created in Accenture Digital and Accenture Operations have contributed significantly to our growth. In Accenture Digital, we are working with our clients to help them create competitive advantage and tap into new sources of value. In Accenture Analytics, we are using our new Accenture Insights Platform to help Thames Water in the UK embrace the Internet of Things to transform decision-making.","Our new cloud-based solution monitors and analyses data in real-time from more than 20,000 centers and with data visualization tools, managers can proactively respond to risk on the network. And we are helping one of the largest banks in the Euro zone implement a major digital transformation. We are combining our design capabilities from Fjord which we acquired two years ago with our analytics capabilities to create a new and seamless multichannel customer experience, while also driving significant operating efficiencies.","In Accenture Operations, we have strong momentum across our infrastructure, business process, security and cloud services. In procurement, we continue to lead the market building on the capabilities we acquired with Procurian. Let me share two examples. We are helping Glencore Queensland, a division of the global mining company to enhance its competitiveness. With our category management expertise and cloud-based sourcing, we expect to achieve total cost savings of more than $300 million. And we are helping TNT, the express delivery company to reduce cost and focus on its core business. Leveraging our procurement and finance and accounting capabilities, we expect to drive annual cost savings of more than $100 million.","And when you look across our own five businesses, only Accenture has the full range of capabilities to integrate and deliver end-to-end services in an industry context to drive transformation and mission-critical outcomes for our clients. A great example is the work we are doing with Mondelez, the global food and beverage company to drive growth, increase profitability and reduce costs. We started this program with Accenture Strategy and our zero-based budgeting approach and are now leveraging our business process capabilities in Accenture Operations. We expect to deliver total savings of more than $1 billion over three years.","And we continue to invest to further differentiate our capabilities taking the first-mover position and investing ahead of the curve in fast-growing areas such as cloud and security. Last week, we announced the acquisition of the Cloud Sherpas, a global leader in cloud advisory and technology services specializing in Salesforce, ServiceNow and Google. The addition of 1,100 professionals from Cloud Sherpas will further strengthen our position as the leading enterprise cloud services provider.","And last month we acquired FusionX, a leader in the emerging field of cyber security. FusionX\u2019s elite team of cyber security experts works at the C-Suite level to help clients test security and see their vulnerabilities through actual replica attacks. This acquisition brings to Accenture the critical ability to help our clients assess and respond to sophisticated cyber-attacks.","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, I am delighted that in fiscal year \u201815 we delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency in each of our three geographic regions and we achieved these results despite the global economic environment that remains sluggish and the geopolitical environment that is quite concerning.","In North America, we delivered 13% [ph] revenue growth for the year in the United States where we have now delivered double digit growth in four of the last five years. We have gained significant market share in the US and are now positioned as the market leader.","In Europe, we grow revenues 10% in local currency for the year driven primarily by Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and France and in growth markets, we delivered revenue growth of 11% in local currency for the year, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in both Japan and Brazil with high single-digit growth in Australia.","So, in closing, we created very strong momentum in our business in fiscal year \u201815 by leveraging the investments we\u2019ve made and by accelerating our rotation to new high growth areas. And I am especially pleased with our performance in digital-related services which grew approximately 35% for the year to more than $7 billion. With the relevant and differentiated capabilities we have built, along with the continued disciplined the management of our business, I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth.","With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year \u201816. David?","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. Starting with the first quarter of fiscal \u201916, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 8.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in USD will be negative 4% compared to fiscal \u201915.","For the full fiscal '16, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal \u201915. For operating margin, we expect the fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 6%$ to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal \u201915 results.","Turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal '16, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. We expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by just under 2% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders.","Finally, you may have noticed that I did not provide new bookings guidance for fiscal 2016. Each year we evaluate our guidance approach to ensure that we're providing appropriate visibility to our expected results. Starting this year we will no longer provide new bookings guidance as we believe that it is not the best indicator of future revenue performance and has created confusion in recent years. We will continue to report actual new bookings results each quarter.","With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Greg, would you provide instructions for those in the call please?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thanks. Good morning. Good revenue growth yet again, just wanted to ask I guess just in the hindsight here, probably you guys did 11% revenue growth in fiscal '15, I think your initial expectations was 4% to 7%. So what drove the upside versus initial expectations, just trying to gauge what was strong versus conservatism and sort of how that may reflect in this year's guidance?","David Rowland","Yeah, I mean I think just reflecting on \u201915 and, Pierre, I\u2019m sure we will have some reflections as well. I mean the first thing I would start off with is the fact that while we were confident that we were well-positioned for a very attractive market in the digital space, frankly, it\u2019s hard and I'm sure you are going to appreciate this Tien-Tsin. It would have been hard to bank on and predict 35% growth in our digital-related services business. So that clearly was part of the driver.","I think secondly, while we also felt very confident in our operations business, which is truly distinctive in the marketplace, no doubt about that, the growth rate was higher. We knew it would be strong, but it came in even stronger than we expected.","When I reflect on the operating groups and you may remember and I won\u2019t recount what I\u2019ve said or recap what I\u2019ve said when we started the year, but I had laid out a view of how we thought the operating groups would emerge. I mean, clearly when you look at CMT\u2019s growth for the year, as proud as we are of that growth, it frankly would have been tough to predict that level of growth, double-digit growth in all industries and in all three geographic markets. I mean, that is kind of a trifecta of stars aligning.","On the other end of the spectrum, not to go through every operating group, we were comfortable with our turn to growth in resources but yet there were still some risk as we highlighted and at the end of the day, congratulations to our resources team again that they\u2019ve reconnected with growth and sustained very solid growth. And then I think across the patch, when we talk about consulting in our traditional type of work way, which in our new way of looking at the business includes strategy, consulting and part of application services related to application development within app services, that part of our business was very strong in \u201915 and exceeded our expectations.","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah, I mean, not much to add. I think it clearly, I mean, to summarize, we\u2019re overachieving three areas mainly; CMT, digital business and operations. When it comes to operations, more -- significantly more than we accepted.","Tien-tsin Huang","Now that\u2019s helpful. I guess as my follow-up, I\u2019ll ask just on this year\u2019s guidance. Just how much is coming from acquisitions? I know, you have got Navitaire coming up as well and can you give us any sort of range on what digital growth might look like in \u201916? Thank you.","David Rowland","Yes. Just working backwards, Tien-Tsin, I\u2019ll give you a view on digital growth as well as our dimensional growth. I\u2019m going to give that view at I-Day, as we\u2019re still working through our view on that. And just to your other question, I\u2019ll start with \u201915. Our inorganic contribution I signaled last quarter was in the range of 1% to 1.5%. Our actual inorganic came in roughly at the midpoint of that range. The point being that when you look at our 11% growth for the year, the organic growth was obviously substantial. As we look forward to \u201916, we are very proud of the success that we\u2019ve had in the market with our acquisition activity in the last two quarters in particular. We also have four acquisitions, Pierre mentioned Cloud Sherpas, which had been announced, but not yet closed, but if you take what we closed and the four that have been announced, not yet closed, then we would estimate that our inorganic would be, let\u2019s say, approaching the range, in the range of about 2% and of course that can change depending on the timing of when these four deals, Cloud Sherpas, in particular, ultimately gets closed. But we would be in that range. So, would be a click up.","Tien-tsin Huang","That\u2019s great. See you at I-Day. Thanks.","David Rowland","All right. Thank you, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hi, thanks.","David Rowland","Hi, good morning, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Good morning. How are you guys? So, I guess my first question is clearly we appreciate the acquisitions that you made over the last few years. We actually wrote about it recently. But is there a flip side to it? I mean, can you talk about the growth rate that you are seeing on your traditional businesses? What sort of impact are you seeing from ERP slowdown, from the flip side of cloud, things like that? Because clearly, we have a portion of revenues growing really fast digital. You are handling that transition very well but the flip side is bringing down your overall growth rate, right. So --","David Rowland","Ashwin, let me just mention two things and then Pierre will want to round this out just in terms of kind of the factual context. Again, I want to point out that the year we just closed, our organic growth would have been about 9.5% roughly and so, the organic part of our business, that machine, was hitting on all cylinders in \u201915 and was a real testament to the power of our growth strategy and this evolution of Accenture to focusing on our five businesses that we talked about leveraging the very distinctive channel that we have through our operating groups in our largest geographic market. So, just that factual point, our organic growth machine is hitting on all cylinders.","You mentioned ERP, I\u2019ll go ahead and put this out there that the ERP business, we\u2019ve always said that ERP goes through cycles and -- but yet, at the end of the day, it\u2019s an attractive business. Our ERP business did stabilize in \u201915, it actually grew slightly. Now, as a percentage of our total revenue, it\u2019s actually gotten -- it\u2019s come down a click in terms of what it represents of Accenture\u2019s business because the non-ERP is growing significantly but nonetheless, the ERP story is not a bad story. I\u2019ll just pass it over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah, just to -- probably just only reconfirm the element of our acquisition strategy, we are doing acquisitions for three reasons. I mean, the first one is to accelerate access to capabilities in the new and what we\u2019re calling the new at Accenture is now the combination of digital services, cloud services, security services, all new technologies, if you will, such as cognitive computing, automation, or artificial intelligence.","Second is to have access to very deep industry expertise, especially in consulting that is the rational for acquisition of Axia, Javelin, companies consulting deep structure iTRAK, either deep industry expertise in upstream energy in retail. That\u2019s the reason -- that\u2019s number two. And the number three would be to scale faster to take the leadership position in the marketplace and by leadership, we mean the Number 1. I\u2019m thinking about Procurian, I\u2019m thinking about Cloud Sherpas. I would put in that category, scale to lead putting more distance between Accenture and the competition. Three reasons why we\u2019re doing acquisition and then we grew organic on top of this acquisition. Probably, one of the best case coming in my mind would be Procurian. We may yet consider Procurian, we became the Number 1 in procurement services and since we made this acquisition, we\u2019ve been scaling faster, and now we are the market leader and the organic growth of our procurement services is even higher than the business days we built [ph].","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Absolutely. Now I understand it and we\u2019re actually fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve predicting recently. The second question is just I want to ask about free cash flow growth in terms of the guidance looking at the lower end is negative, the upper end is 5% at the upper end, which is a ted slower than an EPS growth. And can you kind of go through the puts and takes with regards to free cash flow growth going forward? How you think about it? Clearly, it\u2019s at an impressive absolute level, but I just want to understand how you\u2019re thinking of sort of the cancellation from revenues to profits to cash?","David Rowland","Yeah, I mean, first of all I would encourage you and others to look at the absolute amount because the absolute amount as you referenced, I\u2019ll use my word, but your thought I hope is that it\u2019s outstanding. Our operating cash flow or free cash flow exceeds net income, which I think is a standard for any company which is indicative of outstanding cash flow and we\u2019re in the range -- across our range, we\u2019re in the range of let\u2019s say around 1.1 of free cash flow to net income. And so, the absolute number is very, very strong. As we talked about before, there are many puts and takes in our cash flow in any particular year. Changes in DSO as an example, we have allowed for the possibility not that this is our -- what we\u2019re trying to drive our teams to but we\u2019ve allowed for the possibility of slight uptick in DSOs. You also noticed that we have allowed for further CapEx spending, which is part of the increase and then beyond that, there are differences in timings, for example, tax cash payments can be very different on one year -- from one year to the next. And so, there are many swings but what I would encourage you to focus on is the absolute cash flow, which exceeds net income and is great indicator of a strong cash generating company.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. It\u2019s interesting, we heard some commentary around Brazil and some of the emerging markets growing well. I guess when we think of your guidance and obviously, there is a deceleration partly due to just tougher comps, but I imagine some conservatism as well but I guess on top of that, I mean, how much is your expectation for Brazil or China or maybe even Russia or some of the other emerging markets that we\u2019ve seen slower trends and having an impact on your model? I guess, I\u2019m not quite sure we\u2019ve heard contribution to your revenue from China or Brazil to be honest.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, so, if you look at it indeed, we had a good year in some of these markets, overall growth markets, I mean, double-digit growth if you look at all the growth markets. But again, you will see in these growth markets, some of mature market names, I\u2019m saying about Japan and Australia. Now, indeed, we had a very good performance of Brazil last year on back of some very good program in Accenture operations and our business as well in launching innovative services, especially around mortgage as a service on back of a small acquisition we made few years ago called Avere [ph] and our digital rotation as well which is happening in Brazil likewise it\u2019s happening in other places. That being said, we\u2019re looking at the market as you do. We understand that the global economic conditions in Brazil are deteriorating at some pace and it has been factored in our plan.","Darrin Peller","Okay. Have you ever given any disclosure on how much of a contribution Brazil or China might be to your business?","David Rowland","Yeah, we have given that disclosure. I guess, we showed the revenue number for Brazil.","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, Brazil is about a $1 billion. It\u2019s about a $1 billion for Accenture. So again, it\u2019s \u2013","Darrin Peller","And China? Okay. ","Pierre Nanterme","It\u2019s not something that will be always significant. And in China, we are around half a billion. ","Darrin Peller","Okay. That\u2019s helpful guys. And just last follow-up question on the digital side, again, growth of 35% obviously very impressive. ","Pierre Nanterme","Both trending to \u2013 ","David Rowland","Yeah, China, we are about \u2013 we are less \u2013 we are about in the range of $300 million in that range, so about 1% of Accenture. ","Pierre Nanterme","You know, he is always optimistic. ","Darrin Peller","Okay, very helpful. Just one quick follow-up on the digital side again. The 35% growth rate, again very impressive. It seems like there is enough demand out there, for even of a larger base that kind of trend to continue. I know you said to Tien-Tsin before that, weight for IA Day, but I mean, I think it seems like could it be fair to assume that you can have at least something similar or very, very strong double-digit growth once again this year?","David Rowland","I think that \u2013 we think in terms of continued strong double-digit growth, 35% is a big number. And for planning purposes, we considered the scale of the business, but 35% is a big number and I don\u2019t know that we would assume that for planning purposes, not that we wouldn\u2019t strive forward.","Darrin Peller","Understood. ","Pierre Nanterme","We got plan for double-digits.","David Rowland","Yeah, certainly for double-digit. ","Darrin Peller","Nice. Okay, guys thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. ","Pierre Nanterme","Good morning.","Keith Bachman","Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to ask about pricing. Recently Cognizant called out, what was normally a fairly deliberate and conservative company that pricing pressure has increased in part of their business in a while. I understand that there isn\u2019t perfect overlap in competitive areas between yourself and an Indian-based player Cognizant. I did want to hear what you\u2019re seeing in the pricing environment across the breadth of the business that\u2019s particularly in the allocation maintenance and application development world specifically?","David Rowland","Yeah, I would say that, you may remember, it was in the second \u2013 it was our second quarter\u2019s call, I mentioned that we were pleased with the progress that we have made in pricing relative to where we were in the previous year. And I would say that relative to those comments, our pricing has remained very stable and so we\u2019ve \u2013 I would characterize the environment \u2013 it\u2019s tough to paint with a broad brush, because it really is different depending on which part of our business that you look at. But certainly overall, the environment continues to be competitive. If I had to give an overall characterization, I would say stable at the levels that we indicated that in the second quarter. ","You know, if you look back, I would \u2013 you asked specifically about application services that continues to be a very competitive market, but our pricing is stable. We see other parts of our business where we see some pricing power and when I say that I think about Accenture strategy and Accenture consulting. ","Keith Bachman","Okay, fair enough. And my follow-up question if I could is, your Global Delivery Network continues to tick-up, which I think is part of the reason why you\u2019re able to move your margins, almost 72% of employment basis in the global network now. Is there a natural resistance point that will add some level? Can you \u2013 if we look out over the next couple of years, can that continue to move up where you move say over 80% of employment basis in the GDN? If you can just talk about any natural resistance point, particularly as you think about digital forming a greater percent of revenue, which I would think would be more local headcount? Would like to hear your characterization. Thanks very much. ","David Rowland","We don\u2019t think in terms of a natural resistance point. I mean, we think that we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility for how our Global Delivery Network can continue to evolve. But we certainly don\u2019t think in terms of any natural resistance point. We drive it as the market evolves and as I said, we\u2019ve got flexibility still in front of us. ","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, and when you look from a skill standpoint, I mean, you\u2019re right to mention that part of the work we are doing in digital related services could be onshore. However, we are probably the largest \u2013 one of the largest application, perhaps enterprise apps developer in the world. All these developments are being made via our Global Delivery Network and it\u2019s definitely part of digital related services. I am thinking about as significant part of our business in analytics as well being done with our resources, especially in India and other places. When I think about strong innovations in term of automation, robotics, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence, they are coming a lot from the Philippines and from India as well. So I guess, it would be a bit simplistic to see our GDN as a kind of a low-cost, low-value kind of capability. It is a right cost, very high value workforce.","Keith Bachman","Okay, great. Thank you guys. ","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Pierre Nanterme","Good morning, Ed. ","Edward Caso","Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I was curious if how much of a drag that the acquisitions have become to your margin and is it this rapid growth in the GDN that was just mentioned, is that providing adequate offset?","David Rowland","Well, first of all, Ed, I would say that if you look at the performance of our portfolio overall, we are quite pleased with the performance of our portfolio of acquisitions from revenue through profitability and cash flow, and that\u2019s something we track very carefully. We review certainly ourselves, but with our Board as well each quarter. And we believe we have some pretty half hurdles, financial hurdles for the transactions that we do. ","Having said that, as you know, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be unusual for an acquisition to be dilutive in the first year or two possibly. But we do -- one of our hurdles is the pace of which a deal becomes on par and then accretive, but certainly in the first couple of years that can be dilutive. I\u2019d also point out that whereas many other companies in our sector tend to adjust for certain types of acquisition related costs, the amortization of intangibles, things like performance retention payments at the time of closure, third party fees et cetera, we\u2019ve chosen not to do that. And we report our margin all in. To-date our margin expansion commitment has been based on our philosophy that we absorb those as part of our investments and we drive the business forward. ","And of course that\u2019s just one part of our investment. We have investments that go well beyond that. The impressive thing about our profit model to-date is that when you look at that 20 basis points of expansion underneath that, we are driving significant efficiency across our business to absorb the investments acquisition and otherwise, and that's an important story to understand, so I am glad you asked that question. ","Edward Caso","My other question is on clarification on pricing. When you talk about stable pricing, sort of what does that mean? I mean, we hear that clients are more focused on reducing total cost of ownership. So you and your competitors may be able to sustain margin, but it\u2019s your \u2013 you\u2019re giving back some volume. Help us understand better what you mean by pricing? Thanks. ","David Rowland","So to remind you and the other listeners, when we talk about price and we\u2019ve always said very clearly that we are talking about the profit or margin percentage on the work that we sell. And it\u2019s in that context -- when I say pricing is stable, it\u2019s in that context that I make that statement. And so when you look at application services as an example, when you look at our margin on work that we are contracting, that is stable. I mentioned other areas where we have sources of some pricing power, I mentioned strategy and consulting. I also say that in the context of the margin, but I will also add that if you were to look at in that part of our business, people might talk about things like average daily rates, we\u2019re also pleased with average daily rate progression in that part of our business as well. ","Edward Caso","Thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Pierre Nanterme","Good morning, Lisa.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, guys. Good morning. First I guess, I will ask directly the question I think many are wondering, which is, what is it are you seeing in the numbers that\u2019s causing the implied kind of sharp quarter-on-quarter deceleration in the guide for Q1?","David Rowland","Yeah, so if you look at our guides for quarter one, the range is 6% to 9% in local currency growth. I mean, when I look at quarter one or the full year, maybe, Lisa, if you will, I\u2019ll just \u2013 let me just expand my comments a little bit. ","I mean, when you look at our guidance, you first of all have to understand what is our assumption on market growth. And we assume that the market will continue to grow plus or minus in the 4% range. And so when you look at our guidance for the year, certainly if you look at our guidance for quarter one, the same would apply across that range, but certainly at the upper end of that range, it reflects taking significant market share, continuing to take significant market share, which is our strategic objective. ","The other thing that you have to consider goes back to some of the discussion that Pierre had I believe with Darrin on the growth markets and the risk profile. But also I think, when we look at the macro environment in general, relative to where we were 90 days ago, I would say, relative to where we were at this time last year, the volatility and risk in the macro environment has clicked up a notch or two, and so that\u2019s a factor then. ","The other thing that we think about when we look at our guidance is that it\u2019s as important if not more important to look at the absolute dollars as it is the percentage, whether it be the first quarter or the full year. And if you just look at the full year, before you adjust for the FX headwind, just taking that out, look at the underlying growth, at the upper end of our range, we will be adding about $2.5 billion of revenue, excluding the impact of FX in fiscal 2016, which is a pretty health number. ","And so we work hard to drive to the upper end of the range, although the range reflects what we think are the range of possibilities. And as it relates to the full year, we\u2019re early in the year and as we did last year, we\u2019ll adjust as we go. That was more of an answer than your question, but it gave me an opportunity to share some of those thoughts.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you. And then a little broader question, taking a step back and just reviewing FY15, how has the competitive set that you guys are competing against in deals changed?","Pierre Nanterme","We\u2019ve not seen much change in the competitive environment. I think the competition is quite well established in the different businesses we\u2019re operating in from the consulting and strategy with the usual players. Then, you have the technology with the other players and then of course operations, different part of our business. So I guess, the environment is pretty stable with some, I mean, winners and losers and we are investing and driving our business to be part of the winners. But not much to say around the competitive environment, it\u2019s still the usual suspects.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","David Rowland","Hi. Good morning, Sara. ","Sara Gubins","Do you think that your visibility is changing at all, given that a greater portion of growth is coming from digital?","David Rowland","I would say that to the extent that digital has a strong consulting concentration and if you look at the, let\u2019s say, the average duration of a consulting contract versus an outsourcing contract, it would be true to say that the duration is shorter for consulting than it is for outsourcing. So in that sense, it does give you a different backlog kind of profile going forward.","We\u2019re very pleased with how our strategy in consulting and the development of new technology that we report within application services, that has been a great story for us, but it does change the dynamic as you\u2019re alluding to.","Sara Gubins","Great. And then separately, could you talk about your hiring plans for next year and the hiring environment overall? Thanks.","David Rowland","Yeah. We will -- we are still in the midst of finalizing those and I will comment on that as appropriate at IA Day, but it\u2019s a little premature for me to give you a number at this point.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Yeah. Good morning. Just speaking of headcount growth, I think it was up 17% year-over-year, that\u2019s the highest I can remember in a long time, can you just talk about how that translates into revenue? I would have guessed it would have pushed a little bit higher guidance growth rate for the constant currency revenue growth for fiscal year \u201916?","David Rowland","Yeah. First of all, we were really pleased with our recruiting in the fourth quarter. I mean, we continue to be and even more so, a real, I would say, magnet for talent in the marketplace and so we had very successful recruiting efforts as you know. The fourth quarter is typically when we bring on our campus hires and so that\u2019s reflected in the number and so we manage the supply and demand very carefully. ","And we -- the one point is where we start the year and then of course we have to manage our headcount as we progress through the year and we will see how attrition plays out as we evolve through the first half of the year. We will see how the revenue trajectory progresses and then as always, we adjust headcount appropriately.","Bryan Keane","What\u2019s that relationship, shouldn\u2019t the relationship be closer to revenue growth for the following year?","David Rowland","Well, it\u2019s -- I\u2019m not -- as a general -- well, it depends, it just depends on so many different assumptions. It depends on how we see pricing evolving. It depends on how we see our revenue yield per head evolving. It depends on what we might expect with attrition. It depends on \u2013 perhaps, we hired a disproportionate number of people in quarter four and we expect to hire less than normal in quarter one and so, there are so many factors that go in to that. I wouldn\u2019t over read the headcount. What I\u2019d focus on is the guidance we gave and the context that I gave for the guidance.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Just last quick follow-up, what\u2019s the mix between consulting and outsourcing on the growth rate that we should expect between the 5% to 8% guidance? I saw consulting has obviously been a little bit stronger than outsourcing. Just want to see if that probably continues for next year?","David Rowland","Yes. We see -- we actually see very balanced growth, as we have looked at our business plans. We actually see very balanced growth and we would see, let\u2019s say, both consulting and outsourcing in the context of a 5 to 8 range, we would see both of those kind of be in the same zone. So in the mid to high single digits is the potential range for both of them.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Super. Thanks for the color.","David Rowland","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","KC McClure","Great. We have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Okay. Your final question today comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Brian Essex","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can talk about a little bit about -- I just noticed that the acceleration in the European or EMEA constant currency growth rate was really nice this quarter. So you had about a year and a half now of accelerating growth in Europe and I was just wondering if you can touch on the environment in Europe and what are some of the key drivers to that acceleration, so that we can get an idea of how that might be sustainable going forward?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. Sure. Thank you. And by the way, Jo Deblaere who is leading our European business is in the room and he could be more pleased with your comments on Europe. And yes, I mean, we\u2019re pleased with where we are because we\u2019ve seen the growth and of course, when you understand the overall economic environment in Europe, it\u2019s much different from the one for instance you have in the US.","So it\u2019s more about us than about the market of course. And I would call probably the same trend. It\u2019s fascinating to see that the digital rotation we\u2019ve seen in Europe is as strong, even slightly stronger than the one we could see in the US. It appears that our target clients, mainly the premium brand in the G2000 we\u2019re serving in Europe are really accelerating their investments in terms of digital rotation.","Second, we had some very significant transactions, leveraging Accenture operations with our business process services, I\u2019m thinking about, I mean the Finance and Accounting, the HR, the procurement as well and it\u2019s been a significant source of growth and overall, the consulting is back, probably driven as well with the digital related services.","So for Europe, again, the clients we\u2019re serving, more than the GUs, are reinvesting. We\u2019re always nice on rationalization, driving good growth for Accenture operations and the other eye on growth and digital, which is driving more business for Accenture Digital, Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting and of course the leadership of Jo Deblaere.","Brian Essex","Great. And maybe just for a follow-up, I know the deal hasn\u2019t closed yet, but I think Cloud Sherpas was a great pick up. We know them as a leading cloud broker and a substantial salesforce.com partner. Maybe if you could, to the extent you can, talk about the rationale behind that deal and where some of the leverage across your platform might come from and any kind of overlap with their current brokerage business?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. Sure. I mean, two main reasons. First, and you\u2019ve seen that in the terminal, which has been used by Paul Daugherty, our Chief Technology Officer, we\u2019re taking a cloud first approach. So we are strongly believers that indeed now and even more moving forward, this cloud first agenda will be quite prevalent for our clients and we want to preempt to be ahead of the curve or to embrace whatever you\u2019re going to call it, this new cloud first environment and so to be a prominent provider in the add to service, software and solution as a service environment. ","So second, when we have defined this position for Accenture, the name of the game for us was how to scale more rapidly to take the leadership position, especially around the salesforce.com solution and Cloud Sherpas was a very relevant opportunity for us to scale rapidly the good capabilities we have as we speak, we are the leader in providing services for salesforce.com. ","We are already the leader and we believe that through this acquisition, they have excellent people, a significant number of this people being certified, which is even more important, we are scaling faster and are taking the leadership in this market, which we believe is going to be promising in the coming years.","Brian Essex","Is there a geographical component as well or is it primarily just merging the two capabilities together?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, no, indeed, I mean, it\u2019s global with a very significant and good footprint in the U.S., but it\u2019s global and nicely covering two or three of our most significant markets around the world. So we should take this leading position not only in one, but certainly in few of the markets around the world. Very nice fit for us.","Brian Essex","Yes.","Pierre Nanterme","Alright. I think we stand to wrap up KC. Excellent. So thanks to all of you again for joining us on today\u2019s call. And in closing, I just want to take this opportunity to first, thank our clients for the trust they place in Accenture as their business partner. At the same time, I also want to extend my deep and sincere thanks to the men and women of Accenture around the world. ","Every minute of every day, our people demonstrate an incredible level of commitment to delivering value for our clients and for our company and finally, of course, I want to thank you, investors for your continued support and confidence in Accenture. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter and also to seeing many of you in person at our Investor and Analyst Conference in New York on October, the 7th. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC and all the best.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 Eastern time today through December 17th.

Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, KC McClure. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Greg, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings announcement. As Greg just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.","With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the News Release we issued a short time ago.","Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet for the first quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2017. We will then take your questions before Pierre provide a wrap up at the end of the call.","As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues. Some of the matters we\u2019ll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's News Release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.

We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our News Release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC, and thanks everyone for joining us today.","We are very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We grew revenues ahead of the market gaining significant market share and I\u2019m particularly pleased that our gross continues to be broad based across the dimensions of our business including very strong double-digit growth in new high growth areas such as digital, cloud and security-related services.","Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $8.3 billion. We generated revenues of $8.5 billion with 7% growth in local currency. We delivered very strong earnings per share of $1.58, a 23% increase. We expended operating margin 40 basis points to 15.6%. We generated strong free cash flow of $1 billion and we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","So, we are off to a strong start in fiscal year '17. I feel very good about our business and the speed at which we are executing our strategy to drive differentiation for Accenture and accelerate our rotation to The New.","Now let me hand over to David who will review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre, happy holidays to all of you and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call.","As you heard in Pierre's comments, we were very pleased with our results in the first quarter which came in as expected and represent a positive first step to achieving our full-year objectives. Our focused execution of our strategy continues to extend our leadership position in the marketplace and strengthen our ability to deliver significant value to our clients and our shareholders.","Once again we delivered on all three of our financial imperatives to driving shareholder value. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the continued progress we're making in expanding our operating margin while investing significantly in our business and our people. Our ongoing focus on our fit-for-purpose agenda is serving us well as we seek to optimize the economics across each of our five businesses.","So before I get into the details, let's look at our results in the context of the three imperatives. Strong local currency growth of 7% continues to support our strategic objective to grow faster than the market and take share. We delivered positive growth in the majority of our industry groups in geographic markets with five industry groups growing double digits. Strong momentum in The New continued to be the drop of our growth.","With respect to sustainable margin expansion, we exceeded operating margin - we expanded operating margin about 40 basis points while continuing to make significant investments to build scale and differentiation in strategic and high-growth areas of our business. And finally regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders.","As it relates to our capital investments, we invested roughly 600 million primarily attributed to 10 acquisitions and we are well-positioned to invest at least $1 billion to acquire critical capabilities this year especially in The New.","With that said, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.3 billion for the quarter, consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1 and outsourcing bookings were $3.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. Our new bookings came in the range we expected this quarter and represented 9% growth in local currency. This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in the first quarter which then build throughout the year.","We are very pleased with our estimated bookings in strategy and consulting services combined and of course digital cloud and security-related services continue to be an important theme in the work we're contracting with our clients. Looking forward we feel good about our pipeline and we expect to deliver strong bookings in quarter two.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 7% local currency reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1% compared to the flat impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the actual FX impact, we were at the upper end of our guided range for the quarter.","Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion up 6% in USD and 7% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 7% in USD and 7% in local currency.","Looking broadly at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions, growth was led by operations which posted double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined, as well as application services delivered mid-single-digit growth. And across those four businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in The New with all three components digital, cloud and security going double digit as well.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, products our largest operating group led with 17% growth reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in products reflects the rapid adoption of digital cloud and security-based solutions across all products industries.","Financial services grew 6% in the quarter with overall positive growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets primarily driven by very strong growth in Europe. We did see contraction in banking and capital markets in North America but expect to return to positive growth during this fiscal year.","H&PS came in as expected at 5% growth with balance growth across health and public services globally and strong double-digit growth in the growth markets. Communications, media and technology grew 4% and reflected strong overall growth in both North America and the growth markets. We saw strong double-digit growth in media and entertainment and solid growth in electronics and high-tech. We continue to see contraction in Europe driven primarily by communications.","Finally, resources revenues decreased 2% in the quarter driven by continued challenging market conditions in both energy and chemicals and natural resources, especially in North America. The bright spot continues to be utilities which again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter but not at the level required to offset the pressure in the other two industries.","We expect our resources operating group to continue to navigate a challenging environment throughout this fiscal year but remain very focused on delivering flat to slightly positive growth for the full year.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared to 32% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.4% compared with 10.9% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6% compared to 5.8% for the same period - the same quarter last year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion in the first quarter reflecting a 15.6% operating margin up 40 basis points compared with quarter one last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.3% for the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to higher benefits from adjustments to prior-year taxes, as well as our early adoption of the new accounting standard on employee share-based payments.","Net income was $1.1 billion for the first quarter compared with net income of $869 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.58 compared with EPS of $1.28 in the first quarter last year and this reflects a 23% year-over-year increase.","Day services outstanding were 44 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 41 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of 1.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $85 million.","Our cash balance as of November 30 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter we repurchased or redeemed 5 million shares for $588 million at an average price of $116.44 per share. In November 30 we had approximately $4.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","Also in November we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share for a total of $785 million. This represented an $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May. So in summary, we're very pleased with our quarter one results and we're off to a good start in fiscal '17.","Now let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David.","Our very strong first quarter results demonstrate as we continue to execute a strategy that is resonating very well with our clients and driving differentiation for Accenture in the marketplace. We continue to make significant investments to rotate our business to the new digital, cloud and security-related services which together now account for more than 40% of our total revenues and again this quarter grew at a very strong double-digit rate.","The need to go digital continues to drive strong demand from our clients around the world. We're working with NG the multi-national utility to transform its retail business model by completely rethinking the customer experience. We are leveraging the service design and innovation of Fjord, part of Accenture and [tech] [ph] team to help NG create new services to disrupt the market.","With Hess, the global energy company, we're implementing a cloud based as of service operating model. We have cloud solutions and productive analytics, hence is able to increase efficiency and improve maintenance across its asset base while benefiting from consumption based pricing and we're working with one of the Europe's largest home improvement retailers to create an impairment, a new multi channel strategy to accelerate digital transformation.","Our retail experience at Javelin, part of Accenture strategy and our designers at Fjord are helping shape and deliver a more personalized customer experience. We continue to invest across the business to accelerate our rotation to The New both organically and through acquisition and in the first quarter with the price $600 million in strategic acquisition.","In digital, we are acquiring OCTO Technology, a leading digital consulting firm based in Paris. We also acquired Karmarama, a creative agency in the U.K. and Allen International, a design consultancy that specializes in banking.","In cloud, we acquire DayNine, a leading Workday consulting and services provider and Nashco Consulting which expands our capabilities in service now. In security, we are quite different from security enhancing our cyber security capabilities for U.S. federal agencies and we completed the acquisition of Redcore in Australia.","We also further strengthened the capability of Accenture's strategy with the acquisition of Kurt Salmon which brings deep expertise in the retail industry. At the same time, we continue to leverage our unique position in the technology ecosystem. Our clients value our independence as the leading partner of both the established providers and emerging players.","With Google, we formed a new alliance to create industry specific cloud and mobile solutions to help clients advance their digital transformation agendas and improve business performance. We expanded our sales force capabilities to include new platform for financial services, consumer good and life sciences companies, and we now have significantly more people skilled in sales force than any other provider.","We are always looking ahead to anticipate what next, and our unique innovation architecture enables us to take an innovation led approach to help our clients invent the future. A key element is Accenture Ventures which includes a robust open innovation program that works with start-ups, accelerators and entrepreneurs and we recently formed a strategic relationship with Partech Ventures, a leading venture capital firm to help clients tap into the rich pool of innovation from start-ups in Europe and Silicon Valley.","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. We continue to grow ahead of the market in each of our geographic region. In North America we grew revenues 6% in local currency driven by strong double-digit growth in several key industries including consumer goods, retail and travel services, life sciences and media and entertainment.","In Europe we had another strong quarter with 7% growth in local currency driven by double-digit growth in several of our major markets including the U.K., Germany and Switzerland, as well as high single-digit growth in Spain. And in gross markets we are very pleased with our 10% growth in local currency led by strong double-digit growth in Japan and China.","In closing, our rotation to The New is clearly at the heart of our strategy to position Accenture for future growth. The strong capabilities we are building are only recognized by our clients but also by many prominent industry analysts. And I'm proud of the recognition we have received for the relevance and depths of our services ranging from the strength of our overall position in digital services towards specific strategy in analytics, cloud and digital experience to our leadership in emerging technologies like Intelligent Automation, Internet-of-Things and blockchain.","So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with our results and especially with the balance we are striking between delivering results today like continuing to invest to drive future growth.","With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide updated business outlook. David, over to you again.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre.","Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter fiscal '17 we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.15 to $8.4 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '16 and this range reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year '17 based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 2% compared to fiscal '16. For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect our net revenue to be in a range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16.","For operating margin we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9% a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. For earnings per share adjusting for the updated FX assumption, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.87 or 6% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results.","For the full fiscal '17 we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in a range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion.","Finally we continue to expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that let's open it up so we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure ","Thanks David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Greg, would you provide instructions for those in the call, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Hi, good morning. Just the - I guess, second quarter in a row here, not beating revenue guidance. Maybe where are you seeing change in business momentum? Looks like strategy, consulting in North America has slowed a little bit. Can you comment there? What, any big changes dramatically in terms of just business momentum? Thank you.","David Rowland","Well again I\u2019ll just comment on how we feel about the revenue and then Pierre will chime in with some additional colors as well. I mean let me start Tien-Tsin with the fact that when we provide guidance, we provide it because we expect we\u2019re going to land in that range and as pleased as we've been in the past where we've exceeded the range that hasn't been our intent. We don't set guidance with the expectation that we\u2019re going to beat it.","So having said that, in that context again we're very pleased with 7% growth and there's really two reasons - I would say three reasons underneath that, one is that that growth does reflect we believe significantly higher growth in the market. And when you look at what that means in dollar terms, when you look at the dollar share gains that we've taken underneath that 7% growth, it's tremendous.","The second we're pleased with the 7% growth is because when you pill underneath the five operating groups and look at it across the 13 industries and the 20 some odd geographic markets that we operate around, in around the world, the vast majority of those had positive growth and in many cases double-digit growth. So if you look at our 13 industries, five of the 13 had double-digit growth and of course the third reason, we're pleased with the growth is because of the continued very strong growth in The New.","And so we feel very good about the growth to be clear. We did signal previously that we - that we had some areas in our business that were more challenged. We talked about chemicals and natural resources and energy for some time now, and I would say that quarter one for the most part was more of the same maybe a little bit more pressure in North America in the first quarter. We signaled last quarter that we had a period of lower growth that we were going to be going through in Communications Europe and that played out as expected.","And then, I did mention banking and capital markets in North America, which is more attributed to our revenue pattern on a few large clients in the quarter with the expectation that will return to positive growth but even in banking and capital markets, if you look globally, we had very good growth and in Europe in banking and capital markets, we had double-digit growth.","So our guidance assumed that growth rates in many of our areas of our business would be lower and that's what's played out. I'm sorry for that long answer but Pierre, see if you want to add anything.","Pierre Nanterme","No, I mean not much to add on this. I get to answer - I mean very directly your question, do we see any change in the marketplace, my simple answer is no.","I think we do not see any new trends, new situations as David said, very well. We have some very specific situations but otherwise again our growth is broad based across the different countries, different industries. So the different dimension of the business and I mean for us the name of the game is to be in the guidance. So probably we set some, some sort of track record of beating the guidance.","But that's not the intent, the intent is to deliver in the guidance and to provide you with the right information on how we see the business.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Understood. No, that's helpful. You did signal those items. Maybe my quick follow-up, just the updated thinking on outsourcing versus consulting growth in fiscal 2017? And thanks for the time, guys.","David Rowland","Okay. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. If you look at the full year, our view has not changed for consulting as a type of work and outsourcing as a type of work. Last quarter, and this is true today. Our view was high-single digits for consulting and mid to high-single digits for outsourcing and that is unchanged from 90 days ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman","Hi, good morning. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. Wanted to ask a quick question about the operating margin trajectory. David, I noticed that the products OG operating margin expanded about 300 basis points to 18%. If you could share whether that's sustainable, and what some of the inputs are that are pushing that margin so high?","David Rowland","Yes, if you look at products specifically, they are doing quite well, both in terms of the topline growth and the profitability. There is no doubt about it. When you look at their expansion in margin, I think the high level, I think that's a reflection of two things, number one is I think it's a really good illustration of the power of executing the strategy. So what you're seeing in products is a high level of rotation to the new.","You see a strong component of consulting and strategy services combined, it's a very much operating kind of at the heart of the industry in the client agenda. And I think what you see in their profitability is a reflection of that, it's the power of being able to really bring to the fullest extent our business architecture around five businesses rotating into new with very, very deep industry expertise that's what the play there. As part of that, they also are more efficient just as a tactical point in sales and marketing costs.","So overall, we were pleased with our profitability. We were pleased with our contract profitability, we are pleased with our payroll cost structure overall, and as I've said before, when our payroll is efficient and our contract profitability is good and good things happen and of course in the mix we continue to invest significantly in the business at the same time.","James Friedman","Yes, and just as my follow-up, more generally, how should we contemplate the margin characteristics of the New versus the rest? We would think that the New you would have higher bill rates but would also have higher pay rates. So any inputs that you might have there would be helpful?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I would say that on its - our intent is that so let me talk about intent as opposed to be clear, I\u2019m not commenting on specifically the quarter but our intent is that our profitability profile in The New would be accretive to Accenture. And there is obvious reasons for that number one is, you're talking about - you're talking about a new and emerging high impact, high value marketplace where there is a scarcity of skilled partners who can do what we do at scale.","And so those market conditions typically lend themselves to the opportunity for good economics and so that's how we look at the new and that's our focus.","James Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Can you talk a little about the maturity of the service lines in digital, and -- because you guys probably have the best broad-based visibility into the evolution of that market? So specifically how is the mix evolving from the earlier stage, shorter duration, kind of concept and design work into full scaling and rollout, and how do you see that changing in your pipeline as you look forward?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes sure. Thanks a lot Lisa for your question. What we believe is on one hand it feel certainly early days of these digital transformation. Now as you're saying we're starting to see some more maturity in the way our clients are buying services. So we have moved from the very early days of small project to prototype proof-of-concepts testing the water with digital to try to understand what are the new business models.","I think this wave at least for the B2C, for the B2C is behind us, for the business-to-consumer is behind us and now the business-to-consumer digital related services are maturing more rapidly driving bigger transformation projects.","Now if you move to more the B2B related to Internet-of-Things or industrial Internet, we still in wave one where indeed, we're working more around prototyping the future, finding user cases for the smartglasses for the analytics and for the drones and all of that you like and so the maturity probably will come in the next 12 months.","So I still see a bit of a difference between the B2C and the B2B and accordingly if you look at Accenture, we have been scaling to leadership our services probably from a B2C standpoint I\u2019m thinking of course about the better great success of Accenture in active, where now we\u2019re in the leading position, I'm thinking as well of all what we're developing in ecommerce kind of services or analytics supporting as well as business-to-consumer.","And at the same time we are investing and scaling our services more on the B2B, especially around Internet-of-Things, the industrial Internet and other type of services artificial intelligence, as well.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, and thank you. And then, as my follow-up, can you comment on Accenture's perspective on the policy debate around H-1B visas. Clearly, you're not in the cross-hairs of that, but you are in the top five I think, H-1B visa users, so curious for your perspective on that?","David Rowland","You know I don't think that this is really the forum for us to elaborate on our view on that typically we wouldn't comment on policy matters like that. What I would say is that, you know from our perspective, we have a very strong robot workforce in the United States. We have - I think I'm correct 50,000 employees in the United States and the vast majority of those are U.S. citizens or permanent residents.","And so our model - so I can speak for Accenture our model is to build resident skills if you will in all of the major markets where we operate and again the U.S. is a reflection of that. So speculating I don't think serves the - really would make sense at this point terms of where it might go beyond and it would be tough to predict.","Lisa Ellis","Thank you. Happy holidays guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin, Cowen. Please go ahead.","Bryan Bergin","Hi. Can you make some comments around the outlook for clients' 2017 budgets, and then, how do you characterize that now versus this time last year?","David Rowland","Clients 2017 budgets versus last year\u2026","Bryan Bergin","Yes, so their outlook, and what you're seeing in their behavior to start?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, we are working carefully especially as we're getting at the back end of calendar '16 what's happening in 2017. First, we look at it from different angle, of course our experience with clients, what we see from the analyst - industry analyst and then making our judgments.","First we could confirm that indeed we see the rotation of the budget from legacy technology services to digital related services and currently it's playing in our favor. No doubt that we continue to see that shift in the budget of our clients.","Interestingly, the overall budget including digital is probably increasing more than decreasing because you have the budget coming from for instance digital advertising and digital marketing now are becoming part of the addressable market for companies like us. So our rotation to digital cloud and security has opened new opportunities for us and it's confirmed by the industry analyst who are all mentioning the shift from legacy technology to digital related services.","For the rest I guess as mentioned by David we're pleased with our pipeline. We have good prospect for the second quarter booking. So all of this is confirming to me that the demand is still there but again more and more driven by what we call The New and new services around digital in contrast to the legacy services.","Bryan Bergin","Okay, thanks. And then, just my follow-up, the operations group business performance has obviously been solid. Can you talk about, I guess, the split across the different business mix there, particularly how the BPO business is doing across verticals? Thanks.","David Rowland","The anchor of our operations business and therefore the strength is really our BPO business which is a world-class industry-leading and the drivers of - our growth have been - remain pretty consistent. When you look at F&A, when you look at procurement those are two of the primary anchors and always behind the results and operations in BPO in any given quarter, so it's BPO centric and we are very pleased with our results in the first quarter and I would say it's more - it's really more of same - of the story we've been telling now for many quarters.","Bryan Bergin","Thanks guys.","Pierre Nanterme","And as you're calling BPO, and I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Debra Polishook and all the team and management overall, who have been doing an extraordinary job for Accenture and to some extent since you have idea I would like to rename and to rebrand BPO because I think it's more of the terminology of the path and what we\u2019re doing is moving beyond what we used to call business process outsourcing because what's done by Debbie and the team is a profound of the way you're operating that business by bringing now platform-based services at scale highly efficient and highly intelligent.","Second, more and more providing that business as a service, which is of course contributing to support the agenda of our clients where they move - they want to move from fixed to variable and CapEx to OpEx.","Three, it's going beyond managing operations that is bringing analytics, cloud services, amazing richness in what they do and I truly believe tribute to the team that they have been reinventing the kind of services and that is why we're growing 10% which is much more than the BPO business and gaining significant market share.","I mean the line is always the same, the appetite from clients is for new technologies, new services, new ways of operating the business and this is all the rotation we're engaged in Accenture's last three years, we are benefiting now and hopefully in the coming years to move us away from the legacy commoditizing services.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Good morning, guys. Thank you for doing the call, I guess, a day early. So in that spirit, happy holidays. I just wanted to - I know, David, you mentioned - this is perhaps not the right forum for policy views, but with regards to a lot of the political change that we are seeing, could you potentially go into sort of the demand implications of a Trump presidency, especially as it relates to changes in regulation in healthcare and banking?","David Rowland","Yes Ashwin, I know that that is the topic of the day and everyone is interested in trying to speculate and anticipate what Trump Presidency may bring but again, I just don't - we're just not going to speculate on that. I mean time will tell. It's frankly it's impossible to tell right now and anybody tells you that they have an informed view of it is, it was probably misleading you.","So, we'll see. I think if you put Trump aside, there's a lot of good things that are underpinning the U.S. economy right now, certainly some challenges as well but when we look at it through our lends of our business, we feel good about our market in the United States and our growth prospects in the United States. And we have not identified, anything that we believe is going to materially change that for the fiscal year that, that we're in.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood.","Pierre Nanterme","I think on this - and commenting of course on the new or the coming presidency, talking about Accenture and what it is we were achieving. First we know, we are in the world, which is highly volatile, uncertain almost every day something might happen around the world that could be many elections every year, in '17 we will have elections in France my country, there is going to be election in Germany and so on and so on.","So what it is going to achieve is to build a durable business model. We add scale and relevant services which at the end of the day should be as much as we could independent of any form of short-term political effect or older effect and I think this is what we demonstrated this last, if you look 15, future of 15, future of 16. We've begun to grow double-digits, here we have a very strong 7% in Q1, despite the environment.","So the environment is the environment that not much we could do and so for us our strategy is to take our future in our hands and drive a strategy which is going to be sustainable and durable and I believe that nothing going to stop us from executing our strategy and make Accenture successful.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Right. And for the follow-up question, I know you mentioned obviously, the tax rate impact in the quarter. A part of the benefit is -- was comping standards. So just want to check, is that a one-time true-up, or should we expect from a modeling perspective, a lower level?","David Rowland","Yes, if you remember last quarter when I signaled that we were going to adopt the new accounting standard, I signaled that it had about a two point impact on our tax rate and so it was in the mix we're not quantifying the impact in quarter one, but it was in the mix this quarter. We don't have a materially - we don't have a different view from what I commented on 90 days ago.","I will say that as I said last quarter I believe, is that the ultimate impact depends on what happens to the stock price is the way the accounting works and so if the stock price appreciates between when a grant is issued and versus when it's awarded, then that creates a tax benefit if the stock price goes down between the issuance and the date that it's awarded, while the award date and the date that you get the share, then it would create a tax headwind or would have a negatively impact tax rate.","And so it to be clear, it will depend in the future on what happens to the stock price and you're looking at the difference between when it was granted and when they actually get - it\u2019s vested and they get the award.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Atkins from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Frank Atkins","Thanks for taking my question. Lisa asked a little bit about sales and marketing expense, a significant driver of margin in the quarter, where could we see that going looking forward?","David Rowland","Yes, I mean I would say sales and marketing expense - first of all it does ebb and flow by quarter. It's driven by you know - obviously it's an activity driven cost depending on opportunity pursuits closing deals et cetera. So it does vary by quarter.","Having said that, in our fit-for-purpose agenda that we're driving as a multiyear effort to optimize our economics to create capacity in our P&L both to meet our margin expansion goals, to drop our share price but to also importantly create significant headroom in our P&L to invest in our business that is all in the mix of our fit-for-purpose agenda and this is one example of the power of the focus that we have on increasingly managing each of these businesses and optimizing the economics for each business individually and that includes optimizing sales and marketing costs for each of the businesses individually recognizing that the way you approach sales and marketing in a strategy practice is fundamentally different than the way you do it in an operations practice.","And so we continue to focus on optimization across all of our business activities in our entire cost structure of which sales and marketing is a key component of that. So we'll see how it goes. It does vary by quarter but we're pleased with the efficiency of our cost overall in the first quarter certainly with the 40 basis points of expansion.","Frank Atkins","And then, for my follow-up, as we kind of step back and look at the 10 to 30 bps and target expansion over time, if we were just to take the mid-point, the 20 bps of margin improvement, how do you see that breaking down in terms of either gross margin, or efficiency gains or changes in G&A, or sales and marketing? What are the kind of buckets driving that?","David Rowland","I'm not going to break it down that way because that's really not the way we manage our business as we've said. What I would say is that the two biggest influencing factors to margin expansion are one payroll efficiency. So if we expand margins over time that almost certainly means that we are increasingly driving a better relationship between payroll cost and revenue.","And the second big contributing factor is our client or contract profitability and those are the two factors and so it would be reasonable to assume that to the extent we have an expectation or ambition to expand operating margin over time both of those things are contributors.","Frank Atkins","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Brian Essex","Good morning, thanks for taking the question and happy holidays. Wanted to ask a little bit about M&A. Unfortunately, you guys are buying all of our best software channel checks. As you build that business, and maybe you're more integrated with [Agile] [ph] processes and integrators in certain cloud segments, whether it's specific to Now Workday or salesforce.com or regionally.","Along with Pierre's comments of building a more durable business, how much more visibility are you gaining in the New, relative to your historical model, how much visibility do you have, whether it's consulting or ongoing application development, maintenance business, because of that shift in your business?","Pierre Nanterme","I mean there is a shift in the nature of the services revenue. Now the services would apply in consulting, in strategy, consulting, system integration and solution implementation, outsourcing and the like. So they are all very similar in the nature of the business of what we've been doing for many years, now it's the nature of the services which are of course different because they are in digital all software and new cloud. But the software and the cloud at the end of the day is an application that you have to implement and we know how to do that.","So I don't believe that the shift in our rotation to the newest changing the visibility on the business or changing the fundamentals of our business - fundamentally changing the nature of the services we\u2019re providing in digital marketing, in cloud, in security services and so forth. But I don't think it is changing the visibility or it has a profound impact on the business model.","Brian Essex","Is that the case, if -- as you shift the model has shifted more towards consulting than outsourcing. Is that the case from an overall mix perspective, in terms of -- as you partner with your clients for Agile development, and you have centers of excellence to work alongside them, does that give you more visibility on the consulting side?","Pierre Nanterme","I mean certainly. You've seen the result this last few quarters around our consulting business which has been the significantly moving up and are close to digital has been a driving force on these consulting roles. But when you look at it you chill out the same continuum with clients starting with strategy and here more digital strategies and corporate strategies from the past, then you need to create operating models, digital operating model for clients and you need to own this very well in the industry drivers and disruptions to all of what we're calling Accenture Consulting, then you build solution and this is the job of Accenture Digital and Accenture Technology and then you operate on behalf of the business if clients want to do that.","At the end of the day, that's why we build this business architecture from strategy to building solution to operate on behalf of clients and we are the only one in the marketplace to have this continuum of services because this is what we believe the client is going to buy moving forward and that always is going to be a road for the outsourcing because again you envision the business, you build solutions, and you operate solutions and we want to be a leading company in these three activities if you will. And if you look at digital indeed it's starting more with the strategy and the consulting fees of the business.","And there are already many activities we have from an outsourcing standpoint coming in my mind would be cloud where we're managing cloud services on behalf of clients, would be cyber security where a significant part of our cyber security services are managed services. And three, I'm thinking about analytics we are more and more as well driving on behalf of the clients including some marketing campaign. So again, you need to look at it as a continuum of services we're providing to clients. So we are there for whatever they want to execute.","Brian Essex","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Hi, good morning, David. I just wanted to start with a question on -- I guess, you get the three pressure points in the business right now, the North America banking capital markets, the North America resources, or at least parts of resources in North America, and then European com. So I was just hoping you could maybe give us a sense of in aggregate, how big are those three in terms of percentage of your revenue? And do you feel like individually that they've kind of troughed here in Q1?","David Rowland","Yes. So it's interesting you asked that question, Pierre and I were talking about this just recently, just as we analyze our business. If you look at the few areas where there are some market dynamics that are creating pressure on our business, the areas you called out that represent less than 15% of our revenue, 85% of our business, and I don't mind putting this out in traffic so to speak. The remaining 85% of our business is growing double-digit - it's growing double-digit.","So, when you look at 85% of our business, it's really very consistent pattern with what we've seen now for many quarters. We have these few concentrated areas where the market dynamics are such that it has created some challenges in the quarter that we just closed and in some cases to be fair and we called it out in pointing to some of those challenges will extend into future quarters this fiscal year.","But I think the point of that and it gets back to the statement that is to why we're so pleased with our business is that the vast majority of our business is really doing quite well and continuing to grow and expand consistent with what we've seen for many quarters.","Jason Kupferberg","Yes, and it does speak to the benefits of the diversification you obviously have. Just as a follow-up, I mean, obviously the equity markets have been pretty excited about the US election. But now as we head into January, is there a thought process that some enterprises may hesitate on new project starts and ramp-ups just at the outset of the calendar year, until there is greater clarity on the initial priorities of the new administration, and have you built anything into your guidance to sort of risk-adjust for that?","David Rowland","You might comment on your risk adjustment or things like this but\u2026","Pierre Nanterme","No, I think we have not seen a change in the U.S. in projects and for me maybe let me tell you what I see. What I think is different with the digital transformation of the industries the way we look at it is and I don't want to be too emphatic that this being disrupted and being put out of the business is clearly in the mind of all CEOs on the planet including the U.S. There is a very strong feeling and understanding that if you're not changing your business models, if you not shifting this revolution of the new, if you're not adopting fundamentally new way of operating digitally enabled, you could be put out of the business and I think this force of no, I could disappear if I not really changing now and you have all the facts behind this.","This driving force for me is the driving forces are more significant than any Presidential Election. When you fear about your future as a company, when you fear you can be put out of the business. I don't think you're going to stop your transformation because there is an election. And at least if myself leading the Company as CEO believe me, I would not change my transformation agenda because there is going to be a French Election.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks. Very helpful.","KC McClure","Greg, we have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Just want to ask about consulting. Consulting had been healthy double-digit growth last fiscal year, I think it was 14% constant currency in 3Q, and then 13% in 4Q. It dropped a little bit down to 7%. So just in particular, curious to see what's happening in consulting? And then, you also said, David, that you expect it to be high single-digits for the year. So that would suggest a little bit of a rebound going forward in consulting, so be interested in your thoughts there?","David Rowland","Yes, so let me just kind of deal little fact connect in just for a second so, Bryan, the comment earlier when I answered it that was for consulting type of work where I said high single and so when we talk about consulting type work and relate that to our five businesses, that includes Accenture strategy, Accenture consulting and the application development part of application services.","So when you look at those three areas which roll into consulting type of work, the high-single digit is the - is our view. When you look at strategy and consulting combined and now I\u2019m talking about the businesses, two of the five businesses that grew mid-single digits in the first quarter which was right in the range we'd expected. On the last quarter's call, I believe I\u2019ve stated that the growth for consulting and strategy consulting and bond for the year would be mid-to high-single digits and so, we're pretty much in that range.","Again, we are very pleased with our consulting bookings in the quarter and that goes across strategy and consulting and bond and the app development part of app services and typically bookings lead to revenue growth. So, hopefully that clarifies but the bottom-line is from business standpoint, we see a lot of demand drivers including back to digital and the newest peers alluded to a couple of times that really serve us well in our strategy and consulting business and so it's a very active marketplace at this point in time.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. And then, a lot of questions in the industry around pricing, both in consulting and outsourcing, so we'd love to get your thoughts on, are you seeing pockets of pricing pressure versus pricing power throughout the business? Thanks so much, and happy holidays.","David Rowland","Thank you. Same to you. We have been very pleased with our pricing. I would say for the most part we - we again very pleased with our pricing results. The one area where there is pricing pressure and we've talked about this is that where you have areas that are highly or rapidly commoditizing and you look at application maintenance type services as the primary example, that's where pricing is most intense and most competitive but in that area we're holding on in the context that market. Otherwise, we've been very pleased with our pricing.","Pierre Nanterme","Okay. It\u2019s time to wrap up and thanks again to all of you for joining us on today's call. Before we wrap-up, I want to mention that KC McClure, who has been our excellent Head of Investor Relations for the past six years, is moving to another role at Accenture as the Finance Director for our Communication, Media and Technology Operating. Accordingly Angie Park will become our new excellent Head of Investor Relations and Angie has tremendous experience, held many finance roles during more than 20 years at Accenture, so compared to me Angie, you are just a kid with my 37 years.","I want of course to take this opportunity to really thank KC for dedication, to deliver value to our shareholders and to our business and to have supported so well David and I as Investor Relations. Thanks a lot KC and I look forward to working now with Angie and I know she will be reaching out to many of you very soon. So we could continue being extremely close and friendly Investor Relations organization for all of you.","With that let me wish all of you, investors, analysts and our Accenture people who are listening to the call a very happy holiday season, all the best for the New Year. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.","And in the meantime, if you have any questions please feel free to call now Angie and her team.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Joshua, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2013 earnings announcement. As Joshua just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations.","With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer. David Rowland is also joining us today. As you know, David is currently our Senior Vice President of Finance and will succeed Pam as our Chief Financial Officer on July 1.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. David will then provide our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2013 and then we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap up at the end of the call.","As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues.","Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, including the business outlook. You should keep in mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and that such statements are not a guarantee of our future performance.","Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the risk factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com.","As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Overall, our third quarter results were solid. Although, revenues came in below our expectations driven by consulting. We, again, delivered solid bookings, very good profitability and we generated very strong free cash flow.","Here is some detail on the quarter. Revenues were $7.2 billion, up 3% in local currency. While outsourcing growth was 7%, consulting growth was flat, resulting in total revenues slightly below our guided range. We delivered solid new bookings of $8.3 billion, bringing us to nearly $25 billion for the first 3 quarters of the year. Earnings per share were $1.21, including a benefit of $0.07 from a reduction in reorganization liabilities. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share were $1.14, an increase of 11%. Excluding the reorganization benefit, we delivered record operating income and operating margin, with operating margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points.","We generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow and continue to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $5.9 billion. And we returned approximately $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semi-annual cash dividend. We have updated our business outlook for the full fiscal year and David will cover it later in the call.","Now let me hand over to Pam, who will review the numbers for Q3 in greater detail. Pam, over to you.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for listening today. As Pierre mentioned, our results in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 were solid overall. Although revenue growth of 3% was slightly below our March outlook range and we now expect this trend of slower revenue growth to continue, as we finish out our fiscal year.","Bookings continued to reflect strength in demand for future transformational services, particularly in outsourcing, and bookings were lighter overall than we expected in consulting. Our commitment to managing our business with rigor and discipline was reflected in our strong operating profitability, earnings per share and cash flow this quarter.","Now let's go through the numbers. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP, except the items that are not part of the financial statements or their calculations.","New bookings for the quarter were $8.3 billion, above our expectations overall, and they included a foreign exchange headwind of negative 3% compared with new bookings in the third quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $3.9 billion, with a book-to-bill level of 1.0, which was lower than the 1.1 we were targeting. Outsourcing bookings were $4.4 billion at a book-to-bill level of 1.3.","So let me give you some bookings details, starting with consulting, where we were about 10% below our expectations in each of the 3 categories. In Management Consulting, the macro environment continues to be challenging and volatile. Our clients held back on spending more than we expected, particularly in Europe and Brazil, and the environment is more competitive.","Our bookings continue to reflect projects that are larger and longer in duration, and we booked fewer short-term projects. Although our pipeline is down slightly, we do see growth in demand for transformational projects in operations, CRM and risk management. Technology consulting bookings reflected demand for infrastructure consulting projects that span data centers, networks and workplaces, as well as IT strategy projects. As mentioned on our last call, we are strengthening our leadership focus on the technology transformation agendas of our clients.","System integration bookings, on the one hand, reflected rising demand for industry-specific Software solutions, where emerging technologies such as Mobility, Analytics and cloud are part of the mix. On the other hand, the bookings also reflected lower demand and a more competitive environment for ERP systems work.","The decrease in ERP work was most pronounced in some European countries, as clients are slowing down their investments in add-on work to existing solutions and generally starting fewer large programs right now.","Turning to outsourcing. New bookings were well above our expectations. Technology outsourcing bookings were strong, as our clients continue to seek solutions for driving operational efficiencies and flexible cost-effective sourcing.","Our Global Delivery Network continues to be well-positioned to meet the increased demand for such solutions. The bookings also reflected moderating demand for add-on system enhancements, consistent with the pattern just mentioned in systems integration.","BPO bookings in Q3 were very strong, driven both by our cross-industry offerings, especially finance and accounting, and by our industry-specific solutions, particularly in Financial Services and Health.","Demand for BPO services was strong for both the Americas and EMEA and also increased in APAC, as we have now seen a sustained increase in our global market share. Notably, we had bookings of over $100 million at 12 clients, with all 5 operating groups represented and several of these were in EMEA.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the third quarter were $7.20 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency over the same period last year. Q3 revenues were below our guided range of $7.25 billion to $7.5 billion by about $50 million. They reflected a foreign exchange impact of negative 2.5% compared with the third quarter last year, which was consistent with the assumption we had provided in March.","Consulting revenues were $3.87 billion, down 2% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.33 billion, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. Our revenue growth in consulting was not at the level we expected this quarter. First, consulting bookings were almost $400 million lower than we expected in March, including a decline in smaller contracts that convert to revenue more quickly. This was the primary factor that negatively impacted our revenue growth this quarter.","A second factor relates to the continuing trend of how our bookings are converting to revenue. Our outlook for Q3 assumed a continuation of the slower conversion we had discussed in recent previous quarters. However, we saw an unexpected uptick in the average duration of our new bookings. In addition, more than we expected, our clients are slowing the pace and level of spending per the arrangements they have with us.","The lower consulting revenue reflected the most pronounced differences versus expectations in resources and products, in Brazil and some European countries and in systems integration and management consulting.","Although our outsourcing revenues and bookings were higher than we expected this quarter, we do see fewer short-term contracts and some clients slowing their spending on existing applications.","Now let me give you some details about revenue by operating group. Health & Public Service revenues increased 11% in local currency, reflecting significant growth in health again this quarter, with strength in both consulting and outsourcing and across the 3 geographic regions. Our health administration and connected health offerings continued to be the primary drivers of growth. We also continued to see growth in public service in both consulting and outsourcing in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and at the same time, we continue to reposition the public service business in EMEA.","Financial Services revenues increased 8% in local currency, with double-digit growth in insurance and capital markets. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth overall, as our industry business services offerings are putting us more and more at the core of our clients' businesses.","Consulting revenues continued their pattern of slight growth, reflecting less demand for smaller projects. While Financial Services is well-positioned going forward, particularly in outsourcing, we expect more moderate growth in Q4 compared to the unusually strong growth we had in Q4 of fiscal '12.","The Products Operating group had local currency revenue growth of 4%, it was higher than that in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by a decline in APAC. Outsourcing growth was strong across the globe and the different dimensions of products.","Despite solid growth in Life Sciences, consulting revenues decreased overall and were lower than we expected. A number of our larger ERP programs are now substantially complete right now, and we are staffing [ph] up to the growing demand for services that enable our clients to transform into more digital companies, including multi-channel customer solutions, product life cycle management and operations.","Communications, Media & Technology revenues decreased 3% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected a modest decrease, with the expected ramp down from one contract in EMEA, partially offset by very strong growth in the Americas across all industries.","Consulting revenues declined slightly overall, but I'm pleased to point out that the communications industry in EMEA and high-tech in the Americas had strong double-digit growth. While the communications industry remains dynamic, we believe our offerings around transformation are resonating with our clients. Overall, in CMT, we expect year-over-year revenue performance to improve going forward.","Resources net revenues decreased 3% in local currency, due primarily to a decline in natural resources. Outsourcing revenues were flat overall, as growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific was offset by declines in the Americas.","Consulting revenues declined and continued to be impacted by the completion of several large ERP programs and clients taking a more phased approach to consulting projects. These trends had a higher than expected drag on resources revenues during the third quarter. Overall, we expect resources revenues to continue to decline in the near term.","Let me comment briefly on our geographies. In the Americas, we continue to be pleased with the strong growth in the United States. EMEA declined very slightly again this quarter, as local currency growth is mixed, with positive growth in several countries, offset by declines in a few others. Growth was impacted by the expected ramp down of one contract in CMT, and without the impact of that contract, EMEA, overall, grew slightly.","Asia Pacific was flat in Q3, as we expected growth there to moderate. Growth in China and India was offset by expected declines in Japan and also in Australia, where we had experienced recent periods of very strong growth. We expect APAC revenues to decline slightly next quarter.","So to summarize on revenues. We had anticipated a better overall macro environment in the second half of our fiscal year, which has not come to pass. And we have experienced some changes in demand patterns as we've gone through the first 3 quarters. While we now do not see the pickup, the result is that revenue growth has been relatively consistent. It is 4% year-to-date, and we are navigating well in this dynamic environment.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 33.9% compared with 33.1% for the same period last year, up approximately 80 basis points. This result did reflect improved outsourcing contract for profitability.","Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $887 million or 12.3% of net revenues, compared with 11.9% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, reflecting higher costs this year to build our pipeline and pursue acquisitions. General and administrative expense was $459 million or 6.4% of net revenues, flat compared with the third quarter last year.","Finally, like in Q2, we had another reorganization reserve release this quarter. This $50 million benefit represented a further reduction in the reorganization liabilities established when we transitioned to a corporate structure in 2001.","Similar to last quarter, this is a noncash item, and at this point, the reorganization liabilities established 12 years ago are all but behind us.","GAAP operating income was $1.14 billion in the third quarter. Excluding the reorganization item I just mentioned, operating income for the third quarter was $1.09 billion or 15.2% of net revenue, up approximately 40 basis points compared with Q3 last year. This record result reflects our commitment to driving operating profitability expansion in our business.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% compared with 28.5% for the third quarter last year. Excluding the benefit of the reorganization item, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was 24.8%.","Net income was $874 million for the third quarter, and it was $763 million for the same quarter last year. Excluding the benefit of the reorg item, net income for the third quarter was $824 million, an increase of 8%.","Diluted earnings per share were $1.21, compared with $1.03 in the third quarter last year. Excluding the benefit of the reorganization item, EPS for the third quarter were $1.14.","Let me walk down the components of the $0.18 year-over-year increase in EPS. So first, without the reorganization item, the increase is made up of $0.03 from higher revenue and operating results; $0.02 from a lower share count; and $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate. These add to an $0.11 EPS increase, and we had an additional $0.07 from the reduction in reorg liabilities, which add to a total year-over-year increase in EPS of $0.18 in the quarter.","Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continued to be industry-leading. They were 30 days, down slightly from 31 days last quarter and in line with Q3 last fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.5 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $91 million.","Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $5.9 billion compared with $6.6 billion at August 31 last year, which reflects the cash returned to shareholders so far through share repurchases and dividends, the U.S. pension contribution we funded in Q1 and some acquisitions we have made. We have done very well in allocating a more significant level of capital for strategic and focused new acquisitions this fiscal year, which will contribute growth and revenue synergies to our business going forward.","Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 266,000 people, and we now have approximately 174,000 people in our Global Delivery Network.","In Q3, our utilization was 88%, consistent with Q2. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 12%, compared to 11% in Q2 and 13% in Q3 last fiscal year. Lastly, we expect that more than 50,000 people will join our company this fiscal year.","Let me wrap up by commenting on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 7.8 million shares for $618 million at an average price of $79.55 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 19.8 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion at an average price of $72.94 per share.","At May 31, we had approximately $3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. On May 15, 2013, we made our second semi-annual dividend payment for fiscal '13 in the amount of $0.81 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to $1.1 billion.","So, that's it from me. Thanks again for listening these past 7 years. I'd also like to thank all Accenture people, past, present and future, for driving our company to greatness.","Back to Pierre now to give you an update on some exciting things going on in our business, and then over to David for business outlook, as he is ready to take over as Accenture's CFO.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Pam. Our Q3 results demonstrate that we continue to operate in an environment that remains uncertain and volatile. Against that backdrop, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth, by increasing operational efficiency to deliver margin expansion and enhancing our competitiveness to gain market share.","At the same time, we are investing in our business to develop unique services that sharpen our differentiation and enable us to provide end-to-end services that deliver tangible business outcomes for clients. As the market continues to evolve rapidly, we clearly see the opportunity to position Accenture for future growth.","As I meet with CEOs around the world, it's striking to see how digital is now a part of every conversation. Digital is fundamentally disrupting business models and requiring companies to rethink how they operate, from how they interact with customers and employees to how they manage their supply chains and collaborate with business partners. I believe that Accenture is very well-positioned to help clients transform their businesses to compete in this new digital world.","Marketing is one of the key functions that digital is having a huge impact on. Chief Marketing Officers are increasingly looking for integrated solutions that bring together strategy, technology and analytics, add scale to get more value out of their investments.","To better serve them, we continue to make strategic investments to enhance Accenture Interactive, our Digital Marketing Services group.","These include this acquisition of Acquity Group, the second largest independent Digital Marketing company in the U.S.; Fjord, a global design firm; and earlier this year, avVenta, a digital production company. Together, these acquisitions expand our capabilities and position us as a leader in this fast-growing segment of the market. Accenture Interactive was key to a recent win at BMW, which selected us to manage the rollout of its new web platform to 100 markets around the world.","We will also manage its online marketing campaigns, including content customization and social media in local markets, helping BMW deliver the right experiences to the right consumers at the right times. We continue to see strong demand for our digital capabilities in many other areas, including Analytics and Mobility.","In Analytics, we are helping a major airline improve and personalize its customer experience. We are integrating customer data from different touch points, including mobile devices, tablets, phones and PCs, to give the airline a single comprehensive view of customer preferences.","And we recently formed a global strategic alliance with GE to leverage our combined capabilities in Cloud, Analytics, Big Data and Mobility, as well as Accenture's industry expertise to deliver on the vision of the industrial Internet.","In the aviation industry, Taleris, our joint venture with GE, is already providing intelligent operation services to airlines, to help them predict potential aircraft maintenance faults and recommend preventive action.","We are continuously innovating to differentiate our capabilities to increase our competitiveness. We continue to make good progress with our end-to-end business services, which combine management consulting technology and business process outsourcing. Through Accenture Finance and Risk Services, we are helping Santander Group transform its corporate credit risk function.","The new platform is expected to enable all 12 of Santander's country business units to improve operational efficiency, better manage risk and support Basel III regulatory compliance. And at the same time, we continue to support our clients with their large-scale transformation initiatives. We are working with a large international insurance organization to transform its global financial reporting functions using an SAP-based solution.","The new system allows the client to accelerate their financial close time and more efficiently generate financial statements across operations in 130 countries.","Turning to our geographic performance. Despite these challenges I mentioned in Brazil, our priority emerging markets as a whole continue to grow at a faster rate than Accenture in the quarter.","We delivered very strong double-digit growth in China, India, South Africa and the Middle East, reflecting the continued improvements in our market position in these important markets for the future.","And once again, I would like to recognize the performance of our business in the United States, our largest single market, which posted double-digit growth again this quarter. We continue to see a very good return on the investments we have made in banking, insurance, health and life sciences.","In summary, in this fast-changing yet volatile environment, we are focused on executing our growth strategy, with the right intervention in our existing business and targeted investment in new areas for growth. We believe that our innovation agenda, our diverse portfolio of business and our relentless focus on operational excellence will continue to drive top- and bottom-line results.","As you know, this is Pam's last earning call, and we want to thank her, again, for her many contributions over the years and wish her the very best.","David Rowland will become our CFO on Monday, and I'm going to turn the call over to him now to provide our business outlook for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year.","David P. Rowland","Thanks, Pierre. Before commenting on our guidance, on a personal note, I'd like to thank Pam for her tremendous contribution to both Accenture and our finance function. She has certainly set a high bar for the CFO role, and I'll work hard to continue in that tradition.","Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '13, we expect revenues to be in the range of $6.7 billion to $7 billion. This assumes an FX impact of approximately negative 1% compared to the fourth quarter in fiscal '12. We expect slight moderation in our outsourcing revenue growth, with consulting revenues ranging from a modest decline to a slight increase.","For the full fiscal year '13, based upon how rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX to be negative 1.7% compared to fiscal '12, a change from the negative 1% we provided last quarter. We now expect our fiscal '13 revenue to be in the range of 3% to 4% growth in local currency.","On new bookings, we continue to expect to be in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion for the full fiscal year '13, and anticipate that they will be in the upper half of that range. We expect quarter 4 will reflect continued strong outsourcing bookings and consulting bookings similar to Q3.","GAAP operating margin is now expected to be in the range of 15.2% to 15.3% for fiscal '13. Excluding the impact of the reorganization benefit year-to-date, we now expect the adjusted range to be 14.2% to 14.3%, a 30- to 40-basis-point expansion over fiscal '12.","We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 18.5% to 19.5%, or 25.5% to 26.5% on an adjusted basis. We now expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $4.94, or $4.18 to $4.22 on an adjusted basis. This adjusted EPS range reflects 9% to 10% growth for fiscal year '13 and includes a $0.03 reduction due to the updated FX assumption of negative 1.7%.","For the full fiscal year, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, property and equipment additions to continue to be approximately $400 million and free cash flow to now be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Finally, we remain committed to return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders.","In fiscal '13, we continue to expect to return at least $3.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases and to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2%.","Looking ahead to fiscal '14, we're now in the middle of our business planning and as part of that planning, we're analyzing how the different elements for our business are evolving. As we have in the past, we'll provide you with our fiscal '14 outlook at the Q4 earnings call in September.","In closing, it's clear we are now in the midst of a changing demand pattern, particularly as it relates to our consulting business. Having said that, I'm pleased with our positive growth in fiscal '13, which we believe is ahead of market growth and reflects our strong positioning with our clients and the broader market.","As always, we remain committed to managing our business with a high degree of discipline, focusing on profitable revenue growth, expanding margins, driving EPS, delivering strong cash flow and returning a significant portion of that cash to our shareholders.","With that, we're ready to take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, David. [Operator Instructions] Joshua, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just, I guess, I'll ask about the consulting side, the small deal activity. I know, Pierre, you mentioned last quarter that there were some early signs that it might be getting a little bit better, which looks like it didn't materialize. I'm just trying to reconcile that to the shortfall in consulting this quarter. Did demand deteriorate, or did it just not improve as much as you thought?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, indeed, it definitely didn't improve the way we expected, and we see more softness in that part of the business in consulting, smaller deals. So we expected some improvement, and that, indeed, didn't materialize the way we expected.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. So can we say that demand for the most part is still generally stable then, it just didn't improve in the quarter, just to clarify?","Pierre Nanterme","I would probably say didn't improve, and in that particular segment of the business, it has been probably softening a bit.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So a little bit of softening. Fair enough. Did -- curious, my follow-up. Any -- what are you hearing from your clients as it relates to immigration reform? I guess it just passed in the Senate just a few minutes ago. What are you hearing from clients with respect to that? Is it impacting demand at all? And just generally, what are the implications for Accenture?","David P. Rowland","Tien-Tsin, this is David. I'm going to give you the answer that you're probably expecting, but we really can't comment on pending legislation. What I can say, as you know, is that we have a global workforce. Most of the people who work for us in the United States are U.S. citizens. And where we use the visa program, we use it where we have to get specialized skills not otherwise available and then also leverage our Global Delivery Network. And so, really, that's our position on this, and we really just can't speculate or comment any further on what may or may not happen with legislation.","Operator","Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Pam, best wishes to you as well. Guys, so your report emphasizes the weakness in consulting demand, but I want to focus a bit here on the outsourcing demand environment. The outsourcing revenue growth was also light versus expectations. So I guess I'm wondering, did outsourcing add-on revenues struggle or did you see new deal ramps struggle or some combination of the 2?","Pamela J. Craig","Rod, it's Pam. We did see a combination. I mean -- first of all, I mean, versus our expectations, outsourcing revenues came in well. And we did, as I mentioned, see -- we do see some of the sort of smaller add-on work to existing applications that is slowing a bit, but at the same time, we have this real strength in BPO. So it's a real mix of things. And some of these bigger deals, as we mentioned, with the durations, those are continuing to ramp up slower.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And so given the ongoing strength in outsourcing bookings, should outsourcing revenue growth reaccelerate sometime soon? I know you're expecting some moderation in growth in Q4, but the bookings would imply that you at least have ingredients in place for that revenue growth to potentially accelerate. So can you give us some insight on how you're expecting the revenue growth progression in the outsourcing segment after Q4?","David P. Rowland","Rod, this is David. And I'm not going to comment in specific terms, as we're really in the middle of planning FY '14, and we'll come back in September and give you more specific insight on your question. What I can tell you is that we feel very good about our outsourcing pipeline. We feel very good about the bookings that we've generated, not only this quarter, but for the last 2 or 3 quarters. We've had a large number -- if you reflect on what Pam said about the number of deals we had over $100 million this quarter and -- as well as what we've said the last 2 quarters, we've had a lot of large, very good contracts that we've closed so far. And we feel very good about the larger contracts that we have in our pipeline. And so on the back of that, we are building a very good base of contracted revenue, and that ultimately gives us confidence going forward in the strength of our outsourcing business. In terms of specifics, relative to growth beyond quarter 4, we're just not in a position to comment on that, specifically.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. Just a little bit of pushback on that. I mean, I understand you don't want to get into fiscal -- the next fiscal year, but with the outsourcing booking strength and the deceleration that's happening in outsourcing, is there something happening where duration has ramped up in such a significant way that it's making the bookings look stronger than the amount of revenue that can be supported by those bookings, or are you actually maybe seeing some things that are getting booked and then they actually fall out of the business, and so you're seeing some fallout in work that you've previously booked? I mean, is there something happening along those lines?","David P. Rowland","Yes. Just a couple of thoughts to your question. I mean, first of all, and I'll just work backwards, we have not seen any change in cancellations. So cancellations are not evident in anything we've seen to date. There's not any abnormal pattern in that regard. So we really don't have a situation where we're contracting work and then it is being canceled. The other thing I would say is that nothing's changed in our business in terms of our criteria for reporting bookings. It's based on having a signed legally binding agreement with our clients that stipulates our services and what the services and the fees will be that we'll earn over that contract. And so our contracted revenue is solid as it's been as well. Now we have had some -- over the last 2 or 3 quarters at different periods, our new bookings have had the characteristic of longer duration. And that is impacting the conversion of outsourcing bookings to revenue similar to what we have seen in consulting, but yet the contracted revenue that we have, resulting from the bookings that we've had, we feel very good about.","Pamela J. Craig","Rod, this is Pam. I'll just add one comment, and that is, for smaller outsourcing bookings, there's a certain amount of that, that ends up getting filled in, in a quarter, right? They're not these big -- bigger transformational kinds of deals, but more smaller, sometimes add-on kinds of things. And that's the bucket of things that we've seen be a little softer.","Operator","Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask also, and follow-up on the outsourcing side. I guess our surprise was it had been almost 10 quarters, I think, of double-digit growth in outsourcing, and yet coming in at 7% constant currency, you guys seem to be happy with that or at least better than expectations. So maybe our expectations are off on what the long-term outlook should be in outsourcing, and maybe the double-digit growth that we've had in the past was never going to be sustainable. So maybe you can just talk about that.","David P. Rowland","Well, part of it is, we have mentioned for several quarters now that we had a large contract in Europe. And that contract throughout this year has impacted our revenue growth in total, but also in outsourcing, and the peak level of impact, if you will, was in the third quarter. So that is reflected in the growth percentage that we're reporting. And, of course, it will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter as well to a lesser extent, but then over time, that will drop out of our compare and we'll have more of an apples-to-apples comparison.","Pamela J. Craig","I mean, even when we planned the year, Brian, I mean, we were expecting this moderation in outsourcing. What didn't materialize as we expected was the pickup in consulting in the latter part of the second half of the year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And also, there might have been a few acquisitions that rolled off in the outsourcing side, just clarification on that. And then renewals, is renewals also in the bookings, so that could be inflating the bookings number and why it's not translating into revenue?","David P. Rowland","Renewals are reflected in our bookings, but again, there's not anything abnormal about the renewals that we've had in our portfolio relative to outsourcing new bookings we've reported in the past.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally for me. Contracted revenue over the next 4 quarters, I know it was 80% in the first quarter. I don't think we got it in the second quarter, and then it'd be great to have it this quarter as well.","David P. Rowland","Yes. In fact, it was not -- that question was not asked last quarter, so your memory is very good. But the contracted revenues that we have, and we give you this number as -- over the next 4 quarters, but we have about 10% growth -- or 10% more contracted revenues over the next 4 quarters.","Pamela J. Craig","And for what it's worth, it was 8% last quarter.","David P. Rowland","Yes.","Operator","Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just coming back to the other points that you guys made on the rate of competition changing. Can you just go back through that in terms of where the competitive dynamics are changing? Is this a function that is translating into pricing pressure for you guys? How do you -- if you guys could just maybe elaborate a little bit on the competitive dynamics, that would be helpful.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I will take that one. Thanks a lot, Julio. I mean, the competition I would characterize as pretty stable across the patch. I mean, as you know, we're competing against the same range of competitors. Now, it is true that in some parts of the world, and I'm thinking about, again, consulting Europe, Brazil, as it has been mentioned before, resources and more natural resources, when the market is softening a bit, then the level of competition is naturally increasing and putting more pressure on pricing and on competition there. But I would characterize that piece as quite concentrated on a few areas of the business, the one I just mentioned before, specifically those 3. For the rest of the business, I believe that the competition is pretty stable. I would not noticed anything specific in that quarter.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up. What were the fiscal fourth quarter consulting local currency growth expectations in outsourcing again?","Pamela J. Craig","He's got it.","David P. Rowland","Yes, we just said that -- my comment was that it would moderate a little from the 7% that we just reported in the third quarter.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For outsourcing?","David P. Rowland","Yes, for outsourcing.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And what about consulting?","David P. Rowland","Consulting will be kind of low single-digits, negative to slightly low single-digit positive.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So some hope for growth. Okay.","David P. Rowland","Yes.","Operator","Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Maybe just wanted to start with a question for David. I mean, as you prepare 3 months from now to give us your initial fiscal '14 guidance, are you rethinking any of the internal budgeting or forecasting processes, just given what seems to be like a little bit of some loss of visibility reflected over the last few quarters that was more exacerbated this quarter, I would say, relative to expectations? I mean, I'm just sort of building on the comment you guys had made that the consulting bookings, I think you had said, were about $400 million light in the month of March, but I know you guys had spoken to us at the very end of March and things actually sounded pretty good then. So just wanted to get your take on the overall internal budgeting and forecasting processes and systems and if you think any adjustments are needed there.","David P. Rowland","Yes. Jason, that is a very fair question to ask. And I'll start off by telling you that we're not in the business of missing guidance, and we don't find that to be acceptable. So that would not be our expectation going forward. Now having said that, we do have a very robust planning forecasting function in Accenture. And I think that as much as anything else, we have found ourselves in this period of change and evolution, in particular, in the consulting business. We've had some areas of our business where the activity is much different than we would have expected, some of which would have been tough to predict, like the depth of the economic challenges in Brazil, some of the growth challenges in Japan. And frankly, for anyone, I think it's tough to predict even today what's happening in Europe with the macro environment. And so we have a large complex business and a large complex world and even the best forecasting processes when you're going through a period of change. You can have, in our case, a quarter where the lens was not as clear as we would have hoped it would have been. And so we are always trying to get better in everything we do, forecasting included. We've certainly learned a lot over the last 2 or 3 quarters, and we're putting those insights that we've learned this quarter, in particular, to good use in terms of being better predictors of our business going forward.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And just as a follow-up, can you talk about -- you mentioned clients are holding back on spending, and you were pretty clear that you're not seeing cancellations. Obviously, that's good news, but maybe if we can just parse this a little bit more. Is this clients holding back on decisions regarding new bookings or is it more that they're slowing down the ramp of existing projects? Or is it really just kind of an even mix of both of those?","Pierre Nanterme","I would probably take a little bit of both. I mean, the -- I mean, definitely, the overall environment has not been progressing probably the way we all expected, including our clients, when you look at our Q3. The situation in Europe is not even slightly better. It's probably slightly worse. Even if we do not have a Greece event, if you will, the environment is moving from an economic standpoint to recession. And so the mood with our clients over there is still to be thoughtful and to be very mindful about the way they invest. And when clients are thoughtful and mindful, they tend to wait a little bit more and to think further on when and how much they're going to invest. It's particularly true when it's about smaller projects, as we mentioned, but indeed, this is what I would characterize as the softness, particularly true in Europe and in Europe, in South Europe, to be even more specific. And it's definitely true that -- to be honest, not something we anticipated at that level in Brazil, situation has changed recently. And clearly, we have good discussions with clients over there, but we see more discussion and the clients postponing or delaying their decisions. So that's the kind of environment, again, I would characterize, especially in Brazil, Southern Europe and the natural resources, given the cyclical nature of that business, especially the mining business.","Operator","Keith Bachman from the Bank of Montreal.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I had 2 also. And the first one is, what are the conditions to enable the consulting business to grow? When you started the year, there was expectation, particularly exiting the year, that would be mid- to high-single digits, and now you're kind of tracking at 0% growth. Is it purely economic or is there other practice areas or competitive landscape as you think about FY '14? But more broadly, what are the conditions that would enable consulting to grow?","Pierre Nanterme","I think first -- and thanks a lot for the question, Keith. I think consulting, it's all about launching projects, programs, if you will. So it's slightly different from the mindset on outsourcing, which most of the time is more driven through cost optimization. Consulting is more about building for the future, if you will, for clients. And building for the future is requiring confidence, confidence in the economic outlook, confidence in the business. And, again, there are parts of the world where that confidence is not at the level we expected. And so what we can guess is, indeed, the economic condition in Europe would progress. If the situation in Brazil as well is moving to a more positive outcome, then confidence will be rebuilt with our clients and investors and we might see more consulting pickup. But that is probably what that is. The level of confidence is not at the level we expected. And there is an eroding economic conditions in some parts of the world.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. But presumably, within that context, you feel like you have the risk of a downside appropriately captured at this point, at least for the next quarter or so on consulting?","David P. Rowland","Yes, we think we do. We've -- we feel like we've got a reasonable range reflected in our guidance. Again, it reflects the learnings from the third quarter.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Well, let me ask my follow-up then. You highlighted during the call the importance of acquisitions, and I certainly think that's a sound strategy, a great strategy. Is there a way that you could highlight, a, what was the level of acquisition-driven revenue this quarter? Did it contribute any amount of points of growth, 1 point or so? And then, b, how do you think about it going forward? Is there a way that you could provide some dimensions as we think longer term of either a percent of cash flow or a percent of revenue grow that you're targeting as you think more broadly about acquisitions? And that's it for me.","Pamela J. Craig","So Keith, I'll just quickly give you the answer on the quarter, which was it was less than 1%. And then let me turn it over to Pierre to give you the future look here.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. In the current context -- well, yes, it's not new. I mean, that's a strategy we discussed with all of you during the IA day. And recently, we will use acquisition as a way for us to invest in fast-growing areas. And to execute our growth strategy, and this is exactly what we do, indeed, we set as an objective to deploy something like 15% of our free cash flow in acquisition, and this is what we are doing. I think we are doing that this year in a very efficient way around our clear strategic initiatives, clear priorities in term of industry, clear priorities in term of technologies. I mentioned the Digital Marketing as a fast-growing area is where we have been deploying our capital into acquisitions. And we will continue to do so to make sure that through acquisition, we are capturing new waves of growth. And we're pleased with -- and I'm particularly pleased with what we've been doing this year in that front. And this is what we see. You remember the acquisition we made, I think, a year ago or 18 months ago to build Accenture mortgage services on back of the acquisition of avVenta. And we're very pleased, for instance, with the return we're getting from that acquisition. But it's true across the board.","Pamela J. Craig","And just another little data point for you, Keith, that we do expect it will be higher than the 15% of operating cash flow this year.","Operator","Sara Gubins from Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You haven't made any change to your headcount plans in spite of the weaker trends. So I'm wondering if there's any shift in the capabilities that you've been adding or you will be adding, or if it suggests that headcount should ramp -- the addition should ramp down into the next year?","David P. Rowland","Yes. I think on the headcount -- I mean, the first thing I would say, Sara, is that our headcount in the third quarter was very well-utilized. Our utilization rates were very high, as Pam indicated. And if you think about the upper end of our range in the fourth quarter, it was -- it's right at about what we just did in the third quarter. And so underneath our headcount, you can see a little more increase in GDN, I think, in the quarter we just completed as opposed to our on-shore resources. But we are very, very good, and I think that's one of our -- one of the areas that, operationally, we've really proven over the quarters and years to be very strong is managing our supply and demand. So we'll continue to move our headcount, both the mix by location, total headcount, as our revenue forecast evolves.","Pamela J. Craig","We were up 5,000 and 4,000 in the GDN.","David P. Rowland","Yes. It was all GDN, almost all GDN.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, given the slower demand environment, I'm wondering if you're seeing any pressure in pricing, either from a competitive dynamic or from your clients as you renegotiate?","Pamela J. Craig","We're not seeing that overall, but on an isolated basis in these concentrated areas, where we have seen softening and thus, more competition, it has been more price competitive.","Operator","Edward Caso from Wells Fargo Securities.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned business process outsourcing, BPO, several times in a positive way, and I was curious maybe if you could flesh it out a little bit more, particularly along the lines of, say, strength in generic kind of F&A work versus more industry-specific, and what Accenture is doing to win and sustain and expand work.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Ed, for the question. And, indeed, very pleased you're asking the question. I'm a big fan of our BPO business. I'm very pleased with our results. That's an area where we've been very specific about the strategy we want to execute, which is all around being extraordinarily focused. And you mentioned finance and accounting as one of this area, I could mention as well procurement and administration, where we are taking some leading position and we are shooting for scale, with good results, I mentioned one in my presentation today. We are as well investing in more [indiscernible]. I mentioned Accenture Credit Services, where we're providing mortgage processing capabilities, regulatory disclosure with life sciences. And, indeed, again, in addition to the add-scale horizontal we've developed, we are executing exactly the same strategy in some priority industries with vertical, insurance, banking, life sciences, I could mention as well health. I am not surprised that you've seen that these 4 industries posting good growth. And finally, BPO is a business where we always aim at differentiating ourselves, adding more capabilities and more insights in what we do, especially around bringing Analytics across the board to make our BPO more relevant and cutting-edge.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My other question is sort of on the contract terms. We talked about pricing a little bit, but are you seeing tightening up on the contract terms, maybe where the risk profile of the contract may be getting a little higher now in the current environment?","Pamela J. Craig","I don't think there's anything major to speak of there, but certainly, on the margin here and there, we do have those challenges.","Operator","Steve Milunovich from UBS.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You mentioned some slowing in ERP. Do you view that as just a macro issue in terms of less add-on business, or perhaps also reflective of a more secular shift to cloud-based work?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, it's the former. I think it's -- there's just a little less of the add-on work going on right now. There's fewer of the big ERP things starting. I've been -- I used to do this work myself. I mean, these things just go through those kinds of periods, and it will certainly pick up again. But we do see that trend right now.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned Analytics and so forth. As you know, some people talk about the new technologies, this SMAC, or whatever acronym you want to use. Is there any aggregation that you can provide in terms of how much of that kind of business you do, how fast it's growing?","Pierre Nanterme","We're very pleased with where we are. And, indeed, it's an area of high growth for us. So what we would put in this SMAC, for us that would be Digital Marketing, Analytics, Mobility, Cloud. Clearly, our areas where we have something I would characterize as very strong growth.","Pamela J. Craig","Very strong growth. Yes.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is that pretty much across the board, or is it in particular industries?","Pierre Nanterme","It's pretty much across the board. Now you have some industries that are more early adopters. And especially the consumer-based industries are more Analytics, Mobile, SMAC-driven, if you will. So communication, banking, insurance, consumer packaged goods, retail, this is where they are investing in the SMAC world.","Pamela J. Craig","Imagine that, Pierre talking SMAC.","Operator","Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Curious -- understanding there are several areas of weakness in international markets. Curious if you're seeing a positive inflection in customer mentality in the U.S. We're beginning to hear that customers here are shifting from cost-cutting to more of a revenue growth focus.","Pierre Nanterme","I love the U.S. I love that market, and I love the U.S. for Accenture for many reasons. First, it's a very large market for Accenture, as you know. Second, it's a market where we, again, posted double-digit growth this quarter and probably for some very good reason. I mean, first, the overall economic environment in the U.S. is better than in the rest of the world. That's a fact. Second is, U.S. companies are more than any other companies in the world early adopters of new technologies. So when you look at this famous SMAC, the early adopters -- the creators of this SMAC are in the U.S. And the early adopters of these new technologies are more in the U.S. So this is what's making the U.S. today a more vibrant practice for Accenture.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, going back to the discussion of headcount. Given the weakness in a number of countries, why remain committed to the more than 50,000 adds this year given the mantra of profitable growth and revenues coming in below plan as you exit the year?","David P. Rowland","Well, part of our model is -- well, first of all, part of that 50,000 is bringing in skills in targeted areas, SMAC, as an example, where we're bringing in skills in high-growth areas. The other thing about our business is that we always have -- true of our business, you always have some churn of resources, and that's healthy for our business. And so we're always going to have hiring. Even if our headcount is relatively stable, we're always going to bring in people, both for skill reasons and also just part of our ongoing pyramid refresh, which, by the way, is part of our profitability agenda as well, how we manage that headcount in the pyramids.","Pierre Nanterme","Okay. Thank you, Katy, and thanks, all, of you for joining us today.","In closing, let me share with you a couple of thoughts. Needless to say, we are operating in a fast-changing environment, where disruptive technologies and new business models are accelerating meaningful [ph] clients to transform their businesses. And this is driving demand for our services. Yet, we've been challenged in few concentrated areas, such as consulting in Europe, Brazil and resources. But we are running Accenture as a portfolio of business. And as I look at the year-to-date, there are many key areas where we are performing extremely well, with double-digit growth, including BPO, the United States, China, Mobility, Cloud, Analytics, Insurance, Capital Market, Health and Life Sciences. This is giving me the confidence that we are executing the right strategy, building off a very strong platform, including our Diamond Client relationships, our brand, our industry expertise and our global delivery capabilities, as well as our unique position in the technology ecosystem. The Accenture leadership team, supported by our 266,000 people, remains fully committed to driving profitable growth and delivering value to our clients and shareholders.","We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, KC McClure. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Ryan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our Second Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Announcement. As Ryan just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relation. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call.  Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on market positioning and progress against our growth strategy. Pam will then provide our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2012, and then we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.","As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues.

We include reconciliations of those measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our excellent results for the second quarter, including strong top and bottom line growth, demonstrate that our strategy continues to resonate with our clients and that we are running our business with rigor and discipline.","Here are a few highlights. We generated new bookings of nearly $8 billion. Revenues were $6.8 billion, up 13% in local currency, with all 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions delivering double-digit local currency growth. We delivered very strong earnings per share of $0.97, an increase of 29%. Operating income was $889 million, an increase of 15% over last year. And we continued to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $5.6 billion. ","In addition, I'm very pleased that we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $0.675 per share, which brings the total dividend payments for the year to $1.35 per share. And given our very strong results for the first half of fiscal year 2012, we are raising our outlook for revenue growth and EPS for the full year.","Now let me hand over to Pam, who will review the numbers in greater details. Pam, over to you.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for listening today. I am pleased to share more about Accenture's excellent second quarter financial results for our fiscal '12. New bookings were again strong, just shy of $8 billion. Revenue came in at the top end of the range we guided to last quarter, and EPS for Q2 were very strong.","Revenue growth was broad-based across our operating groups and geographic regions, with outsourcing growth higher than consulting for most of those dimensions. Our performance through the first half of the year and into calendar 2012 positions us well to achieve our targets for the full fiscal year.","Now let's get to the numbers. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP, except the items that are not part of the financial statements or that are calculations.","New bookings for the quarter were $7.94 billion and reflect a negative 1% foreign exchange impact compared with new bookings in the second quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $4.05 billion, and outsourcing bookings were $3.89 billion.","Let me give you some color on new bookings in the quarter. In management consulting we continued to see strong bookings, reflecting an ongoing client demand for projects that deliver near-term and structural cost takeout, especially in the supply chain. We saw increased demand from clients seeking to drive new revenue through improved sales and marketing effectiveness, and demand also continued for services on large-scale business transformation programs.","Turning to technology consulting, our bookings reflect the demand for network transformation, data center consolidation and IT rationalization for both driving cost savings and pushing up the business value from IT.","Since its integration, bookings continued to reflect client demand to update and implement enterprise-wide ERP systems. We see growing demand for cloud, which is leading to requests for application re-platforming and for Software-as-a-Service solutions from the leading SaaS technology providers. We are also seeing more demand to leverage data management and analytics, mobility, social and digital technologies. We are expanding our capabilities to meet these growing demands.","Turning to outsourcing. In technology outsourcing, we see increasing demand across all geographies, including continued strength in Europe, as clients continue to reduce and make variable their IT operating costs so they can channel more IT investments toward the adoption of emerging technologies. We also see healthy demand to help clients transform and manage their networks and infrastructure operations, as well as virtualize and consolidate their data centers to lower operating costs.","BPO bookings in Q2 showed particular strength in the Americas. They reflected good demand both for our horizontal offerings, especially finance and accounting and marketing, and for our industry-specific ones, notably Accenture Credit Services and in health through care management services. ","Finally, we had bookings of over $100 million at 5 clients. ","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the second quarter were $6.8 billion, an increase of 12% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency from the same period last year. As we expected, these revenues reflect the foreign exchange impact of negative 1% compared with Q2 last year. These revenues were at the top end of our guided range of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion, driven by strong growth in outsourcing.","Consulting revenues were $3.8 billion, an increase of 8% in both U.S. dollars and local currency. Consulting revenue growth was strong in the Americas, very strong in Asia-Pacific and slight in EMEA.","Outsourcing revenues were $3 billion, an increase of 19% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currency and were very strong in each of the 3 geographic regions.","Now let me give you some highlights of revenue growth in our operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 17% in local currency, with growth that was strong across the CMT industries and geographically. Outsourcing growth was very strong, driven by communications clients' continued focus on improving their operations and also by an increase, part of which is short term related to a contract in Europe. CMT had modest consulting revenue growth overall. The growth was strong in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, reflecting our clients' continued focus on improving operational effectiveness and customer service and on launching new products and services.","The Products operating group, our largest, had local currency revenue growth of 16%, driven by strong broad-based growth across most of the products industries around the world. Outsourcing revenue was very strong, driven by notably higher technology outsourcing work versus last year. Led by our retail industry, consulting revenue growth was also strong overall, with the exception of some parts of consulting in EMEA.","Resources revenues grew 12% in local currency, with strong growth in our energy and natural resources industries around the world, including some of our priority emerging markets. Strong growth in outsourcing reflected demand for flexible, cost-effective sourcing to meet increased demand in ongoing operations. Consulting growth continued to be driven by programs supporting global operating models and the focus on driving short-term efficiencies.","In Financial Services, revenues grew 10% in local currency, reflecting very strong growth in outsourcing across the FS industries. This growth reflects clients' focus on cost takeout and operational effectiveness, and we expect this to remain an even stronger imperative across these industries globally. We did see modest consulting growth overall in Financial Services. This is driven by strong growth in insurance; slight growth in banking led by Asia-Pacific; and partially offset by a decline in capital markets.","Health & Public Service revenues also increased 10% in local currency, reflecting very significant growth in health again this quarter, led by consulting in North America and Asia-Pacific. This reflects a strong focus on our health offerings, which Pierre will give you more color on shortly. Our repositioning of our public service business continues to go well. The PS business grew modestly this quarter, including strong growth in Asia-Pacific and was led by demand for our offerings in human services.","In summary, our bookings and revenue results reflect continuing strong and more focused demand across the industries we serve.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 31.1%, down from 31.7% in Q2 last year, a 60 basis point decrease reflecting lower contract profitability in 2 operating groups, Financial Services and Health & Public Service, partially offset by higher contract profitability in the other 3, Products, CMT and Resources.","Sales and marketing costs were $772 million or 11.4% of net revenues compared with $710 million or 11.7% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, a 30 basis point decrease in these costs in relation to revenue. Selling costs were down more than that, which has created some room to invest more in our offerings.","General and administrative costs were $454 million or 6.7% of net revenues compared with $435 million or 7.2% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, a 50 basis point decrease in these costs in relation to revenue.","Operating income for the quarter increased 15% to $889 million, resulting in a 13.08% operating margin, compared with $772 million or a 12.74% operating margin for the same period last year, a 34 basis point expansion year-over-year in the quarter.","We were pleased with these results this quarter as we continue to be focused on managing the business to deliver operating income and modest operating margin expansion in conjunction with revenue growth.","Now on operating income and margin for the operating groups. First, on Products, we are pleased with the trajectory of improved products profitability. Second, on Resources, the very strong operating margin results this quarter were driven by more efficient selling costs and improved contract profitability and also reflected a minor onetime upward adjustment. Third, the drop in operating margin in Financial Services reflected impacts from costs related to recent acquisitions, delivery and efficiencies on a few contracts and higher selling costs in relation to revenue.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared with 26.9% in the second quarter last year. This lower rate in the quarter was due to higher benefits related to final determinations of tax liabilities for prior years, partially offset by increases in tax reserves.","Net income was $714 million for the second quarter compared with $566 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 26%.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.97 compared with $0.75 in the second quarter last year, an increase of 29%. This $0.22 increase reflects $0.11 from higher revenue and operating results, $0.08 from a lower effective income tax rate, $0.02 from the lower share count and $0.01 from higher nonoperating income.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $772 million rounded, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $858 million, net of property and equipment additions of $85 million.","Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with global headcount of more than 246,000 people, and we now have more than 151,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In Q2, our utilization was 87%, flat with Q1. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations was 12%, also flat with Q1 and down from 14% in Q2 last fiscal year. We continue to expect to hire more than 60,000 people around the world this year.","Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 29 days, down from 32 days last quarter as well as Q2 last year. Across all of these operations mentioned, utilization, attrition, DSOs, our business is performing very well.","Finally, I'll comment on our cash and our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our total cash balance at February 29 was $5.6 billion and compared with $5.7 billion at the end of August. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 8.6 million shares for $465 million at an average price of $54.03 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 13.9 million shares for $750 million. At February 29, we had $5.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared our semiannual cash dividend in the amount of $0.675 per share. This dividend will be paid on May 15, 2012. This is in line with the semiannual dividend of $0.675 we paid in November and represents a $0.225 or 50% increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year.","Lastly, we were extremely pleased to learn that Accenture was 1 of 6 companies added last Friday to the S&P 100 index.","In summary, our financial results were strong from the top line through the bottom line in the first half of fiscal '12. Our results demonstrate that we are tuned in to the needs of our clients, that we have skills and offerings for services that are in demand and that we are executing with rigor and discipline to meet our financial targets.","Now let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you his thoughts on how we are executing on our growth strategy.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Pam.","Our strong results again this quarter demonstrate that our growth strategy is well aligned with the needs of our clients and that we are leveraging marketplace opportunities to drive growth and gain market share across all the key dimensions of our business.","Of course, we are watching macroeconomic trends very closely. And despite the slowdown in the forecast for global economic growth, especially in Europe, there are some positive developments such as early signs of improvement in the U.S. economy as well as progress to stabilize the eurozone sovereign debt situation. In my recent conversations with the CEOs of our clients, it is clear that the marketplace foresees driving the need for large-scale transformation are still here. And in this context, our growth strategy continues to be extremely relevant to our clients.","Talking about clients. Over the last 6 months, we have increased the number of Diamond Clients, which are our largest client relationships, across all 5 operating groups. We continue to operate at the heart of our clients' businesses and to increase not only the number of clients we serve, but also the kinds of services we are providing to them.","Operational efficiency continues to be a key area of focus for our clients and is driving significant demand for our services. Let me give you 2 examples. We are helping one of the world's leading insurance companies reduce cost through implementation of a large multiyear network transformation program, which includes a cloud-based Voice-over-IP solution. Our services span 25 countries and include infrastructure expense management, service delivery and security services.","In health, which is one of our priority industries, we are using our care management BPO services to help one of the largest U.S. health insurers manage their review and authorization of medical services for patients. We are using analytics to help this client drive down the costs of care management and improve the quality of services provided to patients.","Technology innovation is another key lever clients are using to capture new growth opportunities and improve the customer experience. Through Accenture mobility services, we are helping one of the world's leading car manufacturers leverage machine-to-machine computing to integrate in-vehicle and mobility technologies. This solution gives drivers access to navigation and other connected services on a pay-per-use basis, generating new revenue opportunities for the manufacturer.","We are working with the governments of Australia and Singapore to implement health information exchanges, which are designed to improve the cost, quality and access to health care for citizens. Health Information Exchanges provide medical professionals with access to real-time information that can be used to make more informed decision and provide better services to patients.","And through Accenture Analytics and marketing services, we helped a U.S.-based retailer deliver more than $300 million of incremental annual revenue by using predictive analytics to reallocate marketing spend to our impact channels.","As you know, geographic expansion is a key element of our growth strategy. And we are taking steps to significantly increase our leadership presence in Asia-Pacific. David Thomlinson, a member of our Global Management Committee, who leads our geographic strategy and operations, has relocated to Shanghai to work with our local leadership to accelerate the execution of our growth strategy in Asia, particularly China. In addition, last month, we opened a new Accenture Technology Lab in Beijing. One of the key areas of focus for the Beijing lab is how to apply Smart Grid technologies to help with those China's growing energy demands, which is a critical priority for China.","And of course, we remain focused on our own operational efficiency. It is all about continuing to run Accenture's business with rigor and discipline in order to increase the competitiveness of everything we do and maximize our return to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call back to Pam, who will provide our business outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal year.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre.","As we head into the second half of our fiscal '12, we are positioned very well. We are pleased with how we have navigated the macro environment, which, as Pierre mentioned, continues to have significant challenges as well as some brighter spots. We continue to be very focused on overall profitable growth in our broad-based global business and on building market share in the markets we are focused on.","I'll now provide our outlook for the next quarter's revenue and an update to our annual outlook for the full fiscal year.","So here's how we see it shaping up. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.05 billion to $7.25 billion, which assumes a foreign exchange impact of negative 3% for the quarter.","For the full fiscal year, we continue to assume a foreign exchange impact of negative 1%. This reflects the rates we've experienced over the past couple of weeks, which have remained consistent with the assumption we provided last quarter.","Turning to revenues. Based on the strong delivery and our year-to-date results of almost 14% growth in local currency and how we see the year as a whole, we now expect our fiscal year 2012 revenue to be in the range of 10% to 12% growth in local currency. We expect continued strong growth in outsourcing and continued moderation in consulting growth.","We continue to expect bookings to fall within our annual new bookings range of $28 billion to $31 billion for the fiscal year, although we now expect to be in the top half of that range. We continue to expect operating margin to be in the range of 13.7% to 13.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over last fiscal year. You should expect some fluctuations quarter to quarter, as we've seen in the past.","Although the effective tax rate for Q2 and year-to-date was lower, we continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal '12 and for the tax rate for Q3 and Q4 to be above the annual range.","We now expect earnings per share for the full fiscal year to be in the range of $3.82 to $3.90, up $0.06, primarily reflecting our updated assumption for revenue growth.","Finally, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion, with property and equipment additions of $450 million, and free cash flow in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion.","We remain committed to return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders. In fiscal '12, we continue to expect to return at least $3 billion through dividends and share repurchases and to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 2%.","We're very pleased with how our people have delivered for our clients and for Accenture in this time of continued uncertainty in the global economy throughout the first half of our fiscal year. We are working hard to continue to drive profitable growth as we help our clients drive critical value in their businesses while at the same time driving value in ours and for our shareholders.","Now, Pierre and I are ready to take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, Pam. [Operator Instructions] Ryan, would you provide instructions for those in the call, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang for JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess I'll ask something on the outsourcing front. You mentioned, I guess last quarter to us that you're not seeing a shift from consulting to outsourcing and that outsourcing is not growing at the expense of consulting. Is that still the case? I'm just trying to get a better sense of how long this interplay between the 2 might persist. Do you follow my question, Pam and Pierre?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I think. Just, you do the math, right? The outsourcing is marginally a little bit greater proportion of our business right now, and we see that particularly happening in Financial Services and Communications, Media & Technology. It's been a trend and we expect it to continue to be a trend.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, okay. The -- now that makes sense. And the -- I guess, just on the outsourcing growth, as my follow-up: Is it pretty broad-based or driven by certain large deals? And how would you characterize the risk profile, I would ask, on the outsourcing side versus maybe 2, 3 years ago?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, it's quite broad-based. We see strong outsourcing growth virtually around the world and pretty much across the operating groups, so this is clearly very good growth. I think in terms of the risk profile, I'll just comment a little bit on our capital committee, it is something that we take very, very seriously in all these deals. I think it's fair to say we're getting better and better at it, and I do not see an increase in the risk profile of our outsourcing work.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, just to add a word on this. I mean definitely, outsourcing is a very relevant response to the clients who have challenges in improving their operational efficiency and their overall performance. And this is true across the patch for all our industries. That's why you can see the kind of acceleration of the demand in outsourcing across the board.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First question on demand and then a quick question on the margin front. On the demand front, Pam, you mentioned in your guidance commentary that your outlook assumes moderation in consulting. Is that moderation in the year-over-year growth rate as comparisons get tougher? Or is that moderation in the actual demand environment and seeing some incremental softening there? Can you kind of clarify whether that's a year-over-year growth rate commentary or a demand trend commentary?","Pamela J. Craig","It's a year-over-year growth rate commentary. We are expecting that the consulting year-over-year growth rate will be more in the mid-single-digits kind of range next quarter, and so it is very much that. We continue to see very good demand, as you can see in the bookings, being over $4 billion. And the demand environment is -- continues to be robust in most parts of the world.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great, that's very helpful. And then on the margin front, I want to focus on the Financial Services vertical there. And I guess there's 2 parts to my question here. Are you seeing any meaningful pricing issues contributing to the margin decline in Financial Services? And did you have any write-off on troubled contracts during the quarter that caused the meaningful drop in the Financial Services margin?","Pamela J. Craig","I would say, Rod, that it is more due to the things that I mentioned a few minutes ago in the sense that we did have a couple of nice-sized acquisitions that came online, and so we planned to have some impact from those. We also did have higher selling costs in Financial Services, and I think that's, in large part, due to there is significant transformation going on in that industry, as you know, and so some of that was planned. And we did have, lastly, some delivery inefficiencies, which would probably go into the category of \"we need to work on that a bit more\" that also contributed. But the first 2 were more of a planned nature.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Does that mean, looking forward, that the margin should recover after you get past the acquisition cost and then some upfront selling costs on some transformational work?","Pamela J. Craig","We do expect that the Financial Services profitability will tick back up.","Pierre Nanterme","We will be jumping on this, Rod, because I'm historically Mr. FX, so I still have some personal stake on this. And indeed, as you know and as we communicated, banking, insurance and health are industries where we decided to invest because we see the potential on those industries. So it's not a surprise that you can see the impact of our investments in some of the margin. And so far, we are very pleased with the results of those investments in the term of the acquisitions we made and we announced recently with Duck Creek and with Zenta to form Accenture Credit Services. And of course, the other data point is we're pleased to announce that this quarter, in Q2, Financial Services bookings were $2.1 billion, the highest booking ever in the Financial Services history.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to pick up on Rod's question there but maybe from a different perspective on the contribution. Because you guys are calling out the acquired impact to the margins, is there a way to think about how much is actually helping on the revenue growth side as well?","Pamela J. Craig","It did have a good contribution to the revenue growth in Financial Services. I'm not going to give you the exact number, but it was meaningful to that growth.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And just have a quick follow-up. When we look at the results, hard to argue with 13% to 14% first half growth and mid-teens trailing 12-month bookings at this point in time. But when you look at the implied growth into the back half of the year at their midpoint of the range, it looks like you guys are implying 8.5%. What would -- I mean, at this point, just given where the growth is right now, especially with bookings as strong as they are, why would you guys expect to decelerate in the back half of the year?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, it's just more how we see the -- how it's shaping up. And when you think about it, it's more like a 7% to 10%, which is, I think, how we saw the business when we started the year and then consulting was running hotter. And now we see it coming back closer to that level, which is a very, very good level. So the moderation is primarily in consulting, and outsourcing continues to be strong.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to drill down on the consulting business, maybe your outlook by region. It sounded like Americas and Asia might have been accelerating, but maybe a little bit of a decel in Europe is expected? Maybe you can just break it down further.","Pamela J. Craig","Well, I'm probably -- I'm not going to break it down in terms of numbers, but I think your characterization is fair. Although, we expect moderation to be in the Americas and Asia-Pacific as well as we go forward. But Europe is the one that's lowest in terms of a growth rate right now.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And did Europe deteriorate during the quarter, or it's just -- it's kind of happening to plan? And then just lastly on headcount growth, I noticed sequentially headcount growth didn't grow as much, but you've kept your guidance for at least 60,000 heads for gross hires. So just curious on, is there a timing issue for headcount with this quarter and we should expect it to pick up in the next 2?","Pamela J. Craig","All right, so the first question, okay, the headcount was the -- that's the question I've got here. So there's nothing unusual going on with headcount, Bryan. I mean, it's pretty much -- as you know, we manage supply and demand around the world and that's really all that's going on. So the utilization was at 87%. I think we're being tight and rigorous about that, as we always are, and there's nothing unusual there.","Pierre Nanterme","Then from a consulting standpoint, I am going to jump on that one. I don't think there is anything in Q2 that was not expected or took us by surprise from a consulting standpoint. I think Pam mentioned in prior quarters that indeed, if you're looking at the world macroeconomic environment, it's public knowledge that Europe is more softer from an economic standpoint compared to the rest of the world. We're watching carefully what's happening especially in the Financial Services sector in some part of Europe. It's not the same story if you are looking at the different countries in Europe. And so what's happening there is more happening as planned, and I don't think there is anything that was unexpected.","Pamela J. Craig","Right. And just what's interesting, though, is that the outsourcing demand is quite strong in Europe. So as you can imagine, we're responding to that.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Nate Rozof, Morgan Stanley.","Nathan A. Rozof - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question for you is related to the pipeline. I think, after 2 very strong bookings quarter -- last quarter, Pam, you made the comment that there was going to be some work needed to be done in terms of replenishing the pipeline. And now, here we are again with another strong bookings quarter. So I wanted to get your sense on, had you been able to replenish the pipeline? And what was the philosophy of deals moving to the pipeline relative to maybe a quarter ago?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I -- it's a great question and, as you can imagine, something we are very focused on. And I think we have made some good progress in building the pipeline. We do have some more work to do. And again, with the strong bookings, it was, I think, overall very good. One thing I'll just mention because sometimes this relates a little bit to disability, and I've given you this in the past, is that when we look at revenue under contract, we do have 13% more than we did at this time last year both for the next 2 quarters of the fiscal year, but also for the next 4 quarters. So I think that shows you that we're -- that that's building as well.","Nathan A. Rozof - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's terrific. It's good to hear about the visibility. Can you provide any insight in terms of just breaking down into the bookings number a little bit more? Any insight in terms of new wins in that strong bookings number versus renewals and\/or any change relative to what's kind of normal at this time of the year?","Pamela J. Craig","I don't think there's anything major to point out there, Nate. I mean, I think one of the things that we were of course looking at last year -- sorry, last quarter, was how the calendar year turn was going to go. And we haven't seen anything notably changed that much in terms of clients' budgets and sort of all of that. So I don't think there's really anything big to point out with respect to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller, Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Pierre, I think you mentioned earlier that, in Europe, you were seeing more outsourcing and I think it's well received, especially just given the historical trends there. So do you think now clients continue to focus on cost takeout? Those historical barriers around cultural factors and labor laws and language are actually really becoming less of a hurdle and you're actually seeing it hit the numbers now, first of all?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I mean, if you look at this, at the demand, I mean, clearly, operational efficiency is extremely important for all the reasons we know. And again, we feel we are extremely well positioned to provide the right answer to that particular agenda. From a consulting standpoint, from an outsourcing standpoint, we have, I think, all the tools, techniques and offerings to tackle that agenda. But at the same time, we see a growing demand for more innovation and using more the technology innovation to drive either more efficiency but, as well, more the revenue agenda of our clients. And what's interesting to see in the marketplace is, indeed, those 2 activities, and it's not a surprise, are picking up at the same time, and clients are investing to be more efficient as well as they're investing to capture more growth opportunities. And we're very pleased, if you will, with those 2 engines for growth.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just one follow-up to that. Is it market share also, are you seeing your win rates increase?","Pamela J. Craig","I don't think -- I mean, our win rates have been up, as I think back over the last year. And I don't think we saw a significant change this quarter in that.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, but it's been -- it's pretty stable, Pam?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg, Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to ask a question regarding SG&A. I mean, you guys have done such a great job over a long period of time there managing the SG&A cost base. And I wanted to get an idea of how much more upside, if you will, remains there to the extent you see opportunity for further cost takeout, what specific areas that might be in. And part of the reason I ask the question is, the gross margins continue to go down year-over-year, I think it's been about 6 straight quarters. But obviously, you managed the business to operating margins and you've been hitting your goals there, but the SG&A piece of the equation obviously becomes even more important if the gross margins continue to slide. So any color you can give us there would be great.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes. I mean, I think you're right, right. I mean, I think philosophically, we are looking to manage SG&A to grow slower than revenue, right? And so that's sort of part of our culture that we're really careful with our cost and really manage all that, manage our cost structure with a lot of rigor and discipline. And so I was pleased to see the improvement in the selling cost. You do know that when we invest in the business, that's typically on the sales and marketing line as well. That's where we have our offerings and our initiatives, so we want to make sure that we can do some things there as well and look to do as much as we can but all within this overall framework of, in the end, delivering modest margin expansion.","Pierre Nanterme","And all of this is -- I'm going to jump on this one because it's a kind of mindset, if you will. And probably, you've been hearing me and Pam using a lot \"rigor and discipline,\" which is coming back and coming back. But if we are mentioning that sort, it's only because we mean it. And at the end of the day, rigor and discipline is what you need as a mindset for proper execution. And I think, in that organization, there is a relentless focus on improving productivity and efficiency in everything we do. And there is no reason that will not apply to SG&A as to the rest of our business.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And let me just ask a follow-up on your latest thoughts regarding non-linear growth opportunities at Accenture. You guys now have about 0.25 million employees. And are there some goals you can share with us just in terms of size for your non-linear businesses such as on the Accenture Software side or BPO or other types of IP-based solutions you have in your portfolio? I know you'd talked a bit about this at a past analyst meetings. I wanted to see if there was any update there you could share.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. I mean, at the high level, we are a people-based organization. We will grow our headcount and we love that. We love our people, we love growing base, we're used to that. We know how to hire, train, develop, deploy, and that's part of something we will do and we will continue to do. That being said, it is part of our plan to bring more IPs in our system, if you will, to be more differentiated. That we will continue to be a people-based business and grow that way. From an IP standpoint, indeed, we are pleased with the progress we are making either by leveraging the good technologies from our alliance partners. And we are doing that every day to bring our unit industry expertise or by making some focused investments and strategic investments. I mentioned a few we are doing in each and every industry. So we will continue to be more IP-based and to grow indeed that part of our business as well. But the people-based part will remain important.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is related to the bookings. In the next few quarters, you have obviously very significant ramps related to the contracts that you're signing. You also have a lot of increased headcount coming up, given the relatively flattish headcount this quarter. Are there marginal cash implications in the back half of the year or even slightly beyond that as we look at those ramps?","Pamela J. Craig","What do you mean by marginal cash applications?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is it going to -- because you're obviously ramping your -- ramping large contracts, there is an initial cost involved. Does it have a negative implication for your gross margins...","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I mean, I guess sort of this giant portfolio, thousands of contracts, right. We always have some in their early stages. And that's part of what each operating group manages as they look to deliver each year. So there's nothing unusual there, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, so nothing out of the ordinary, okay. The second question is on Nokia. I guess it's sort of client-specific, and let me take a shot at it even though I know you historically don't answer client-specific questions. You're making buyout offers to the Belgian employees. Is that sort of too early in the process? Is that consistent with your expectations? How's the project growing? I mean, it is Symbian support and we kind of know how Symbian is doing in the market, so a little bit concerned there.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I mean, as you expected, I think when you asked the question, we're not going to comment specifically on a client contract.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with UBS.","Arvind A. Ramnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. You're continuing to see strength in some of your end markets that are having pressures, specifically Financial Services and Europe. So do you feel like the ongoing pressure that your clients are seeing will continue to drive business your way? Or do you think at some point it will catch up with your overall revenue growth?","Pamela J. Craig","I think the thing that we see is continued robust demand for outsourcing and Financial Services. And we don't see that letting up.","Arvind A. Ramnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, great. And you also attributed your gross margin pressure to contract profitability. Can you expand on that? Is that driven due to higher contractor costs or due to pressure on bill rates for the contract work?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, I mean I think, as I mentioned, it's in Financial Services and in Health & Public Service. And in those cases where there's things that we wish we do better is what we thought -- we referred to as delivery and efficiencies, and that's more where it takes more cost to deliver something than we thought it would.","Arvind A. Ramnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just one other quick one. Are you still planning on having your Analyst Day at the -- in April, or is it moved to the fall?","Pamela J. Craig","We are not planning to have it in April. And we, at this point, are looking to do it in the fall. And stay tuned, we'll have an update on that.","Pierre Nanterme","With results reflecting the cycle of our business, so that's why it's moving to the fall.","Arvind A. Ramnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, we think it's better, from the standpoint of our fiscal year.","Arvind A. Ramnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, great. And I mean, I guess -- would that mean you'll provide guidance only when you hold the Analyst Day for the following fiscal year?","Pamela J. Craig","Stay tuned on that.","Operator","And the final question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess my -- I'm going to try and squeeze 2 even though it's the last 1. But any changes in the spending patterns by clients? Are wallets opening up a little bit here as there's been some macro stability? And what could cause those wallets to shut up?","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, as we said, we're looking carefully at the macroeconomic environment. We're talking to our clients every day. We're looking at the analysts' reports no later than this morning, and really, I'm reading all the reports from the economy coming from all around the world. And we are not seeing any significant changing in the current client environment. And we do not see much reason that why things would change, at least things we know.","Pamela J. Craig","Right.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, I just want to go back to the first question because it looks like outsourcing is kind of outpacing consulting. Is this -- I mean, is there any linkage at all to the business cycle or [indiscernible] center a part of the cycle where maybe consulting moderates and outsourcing picks up? Or have you been converting those consulting engagements into outsourcing? I'm just trying to get a final feel for that.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I think there is some, what I would call catalyst effect of some of the consulting going into outsourcing, but we haven't really quantified that. But there's a lot of activity under what we've termed framework agreements in outsourcing. And I think that as we mentioned in the comments, right, this relentless focus on cost takeout and getting more operationally efficient, it just really lends itself to doing that kind of work and really helping clients get more fit. And of course, with the -- what's going on with technology, that's really supporting that, too, because there's opportunities through new -- through these new technologies to make some of these IT costs more variable, and that's, of course, very attractive to clients. I think that's it.","Pierre Nanterme","And again, I've seen -- I mean, a lot of your question concerning consulting and outsourcing, and they're all very valid. Again, just a reminder that we've been booking in the range of $4 billion this past 4 quarters in consulting. So we'd like to make sure everybody get, if you're on that call, that we're pleased with where we are with outsourcing, with consulting and we are extremely pleased with where we are in outsourcing.","Okay, I think it's time to wrap up the call. Thanks again for joining us today. As you heard, we are very pleased with our strong results in the second quarter and the first half of the fiscal year. We are confident that we will continue to deliver profitable growth, and we are remaining focused on accelerating the execution of our growth strategy. We believe we are well positioned to see the opportunities we see in the marketplace and have raised our business outlook for revenue growth and EPS for the full year.","And of course, our strong performance would not be possible without the incredibly talented team of Accenture women and men around the world. I would also like to thank our investors for your continued support. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, feel free to call KC to make arrangements for a follow-up. Thank you for participating, and all the best.","Operator","Okay, ladies and gentlemen, today's conference was recorded for replay.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Angie Park. Please go ahead.","Angie Park","Thank you, Ryan and thanks everyone for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings announcement. As Ryan just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.

Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you Angie and thanks everyone for joining us today. This was not a strong quarter for Accenture. We delivered revenue growth in the upper end of our guided range and again gained significant market share. I am particularly pleased with our very strong new bookings for the quarter and year-to-date which demonstrates that our services and capabilities continue to be both highly relevant to our clients and very differentiated in the marketplace. We generated very strong cash flow for the quarter and returned substantial cash to shareholders all the while continuing to make significant investments to drive future growth. ","Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered excellent new bookings of $9.8 billion. We grew revenues of 7% in local currency to $8.9 billion with broad based growth once again across the different dimensions of our business. We delivered earnings per share of $1.52 on an adjusted basis, an 8% increase. Operating margin was 15.5% on an adjusted basis, consistent with the third quarter last year. We generated strong free cash flow $1.7 billion, and we returned approximately $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend. ","So we had another good quarter, and as we enter the fourth quarter I feel very confident that we are well positioned to deliver our business outlook for the year. Now let me hand over to David who will review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you. ","David P. Rowland","Thanks Pierre and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As Pierre mentioned, we were pleased with our third quarter results which were in the range we expected and position us very well to achieve our full year financial guidance. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I thought it would be useful to highlight how we're delivering on an essential aspect of our growth strategy and our model for driving superior shareholder value. You have heard me saying many times previously that our growth strategy was conceived with an important objective in mind, which is to create durability in our revenue growth at a level which is consistently above market thereby taking share and strengthening our position as a market leader. And against that objective, we've created a diverse business that spans 13 industry groups, 15 geographic markets, 5 businesses which has created a powerful growth model in both scale and durability. ","Our third quarter and year-to-date results are good illustration of our growth model in action where being a market leader across many dimensions of the market has resulted in consistent growth levels that we estimate are more than two times the rate of growth of the basket of publicly traded companies. And importantly, we delivered these results in a highly dynamic environment which is exactly the way our growth strategy is intended to work. With that said, we will also comment on a few of the highlights and the context of our three financial imperatives for driving shareholder value.","Net revenue growth of 7% in local currency in the third quarter continued to be highlighted by strong double-digit growth in all three areas of The New including digital cloud and security related services. We continued to see positive growth in most geographic markets and industries and while we saw encouraging signs in several areas of pressure previously noted we did experience lower than expected revenues in health and public service in North America. At the same time, we continue to be very pleased with momentum in Europe in the growth markets which combined delivered 10% growth in the quarter. ","Operating margin on an adjusted basis of 15.5% in the third quarter was consistent with last year and resulted in 20 basis points of expansion on a year-to-date basis. This level of margin expansion continues to include significant investments in our business and our people, and on a year-to-date basis we have delivered very strong earnings per share growth of 10% over FY2016 adjusted EPS, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter and $2.7 billion year-to-date keeps us on a trajectory to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year while returning at least 4.2 billion cash to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continued to invest significantly to acquire skill and capability in key growth areas with a year-to-date capital investment of $1.2 billion across seven [ph] transactions.","So we're pleased with our overall results in the third quarter which continued to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability, and cash flow. With that said let's get into the details of the quarter starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.8 billion for the quarter, consulting bookings were $5.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1, outsourcing bookings were $4.6 billion also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were very pleased with our new bookings, which represent 8% growth in local currency reflecting the second highest level of new bookings in our history with a record high in consulting bookings.","Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $8.87 billion, a 5% increase in USD and 7% in local currency reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2% compared with a 2.5% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Our consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $4 billion, up 6% in USD and 7% in local currency. ","Looking at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions, growth was led by operations which posted double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter and application services, which delivered high-single-digit growth. Both operations and application services growth was fueled by significant rotation to The New. Strategy and consulting services combined continued to grow low-single digits. Across those businesses, the dominant driver continues to be strong double-digit growth in The New with all three components digital, cloud, and security growing double-digits as well.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, product flow at all operating groups was 15% growth driven by strong growth across all industries and geographies led by consumer goods, retail, and travel services. Financial services grew 6% in the quarter driven by strong growth in banking and capital markets globally and overall strong growth in both Europe and the growth markets. Resources grew 4% and returned to positive growth this quarter as expected reflecting growth across all geographies. ","Globally we saw very strong growth in chemicals and natural resources and good growth in utilities while the challenges in energy continued. Communications media and technology also grew 4% reflecting strong double-digit growth in software and platforms which more than offset roughly flat growth in the other two industries. We saw solid overall growth in North America and very strong growth in the growth markets, partially offset by continued contraction in Europe. ","Finally H&PS came in lower than expected at 2% growth as we did not see the uptick that we anticipated in both public service and health in North America. Our North America business was negatively impacted by a slower than expected decision making and initiation of new projects due to continued uncertainty on healthcare legislation and state and federal budgets. We now expect these factors to continue to impact our business at least through the fourth quarter.","Moving down the income statement gross margin for the quarter was 32.8% compared to 31.9% the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% consistent with the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.2% compared to 5.3% for the same period last year. This quarter we recorded a settlement charge related to the terminations of our U.S. pension plan consistent with my comments in March. This $510 million charge decreased quarter three operating margin by 570 basis points, lowered our quarter three tax rate by 7.2% and decreased net income by $312 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.47. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. ","Operating income was $1.4 billion in the third quarter reflecting a 15.5% adjusted operating margin consistent with quarter three last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.52 compared with EPS of a $1.41 in the third quarter last year. Our days services outstanding were 41one days compared to 42 days last quarter and 41 days in the third quarter last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.8 billion net of property and equipment additions of 136 million. Our cash balance at May 31st was $3.4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31st. ","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders in the third quarter we repurchased to redeem 4.9 million shares for $589 million at an average price of $120.50 per share. At May 31st we had 3.7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Finally as Pierre mentioned on May 15, 2017 we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal 2017 in the amount of a $1.21 per share bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.6 billion. ","So with three quarters in the books we feel good about our results today and we're working hard to deliver quarter four and another successful year. Now let me turn it back to Pierre. ","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. Our strong results for the quarter and year-to-date demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We are successfully driving the business transformation at Accenture while at the same time consistently delivering above market performance. Today the breadth of capabilities we provide end to end is truly unique in the marketplace and we are well positioned to compete at scale in each of our five businesses driving synergies across them to deliver value and business outcomes for our clients. We continue to rotate our business to The New, digital, cloud, and security related services which again grew at a very strong double-digit rate in the quarter and now accounts for 50% of total revenue. I am absolutely delighted that we have achieved this significant milestone for our business so rapidly. ","Our ascension to these new high growth areas, the differentiation of our capabilities in the market, and the diversity of our business have enabled us to continue to gain significant market share. The need to go digital remains a top priority for clients and we are investing aggressively to drive innovation and deliver digital transformation. A great example is the capability we have [indiscernible] Accenture Interactive and I am again delighted that for the second year in a row Advertising Age has named Accenture Interactive the largest provider of digital marketing services both globally and in the U.S. ","Accenture Interactive is working with many of the world's leading brands to transform the customer experience. As an illustration with Carnival, the cruise operator we are helping develop a new platform using wearable technology, the Internet of Things and analytics to transform the guest experience with intelligent customerization. Carnival will be able to anticipate every passengers preferences, likes, and needs. And we continue to broaden the services we provide through Accenture Interactive. In the third quarter we acquired two creative and design agencies in Australia, the Monkeys and Maud and we acquired Kunstmann in Belgium to expand our digital and user experience capabilities.","In today's digital and highly connected world security is essential and we're building a market leading security capability to help clients become more resilient. I am pleased that in the third quarter we saw very strong double-digit growth in our security business and we are bringing deep and differentiated expertise to our clients. We are working with a California based facility to protect its critical assets including nuclear power plants through expertise inside their security as well as identity and access management.","Increasingly the work we do is enabled more and more by new IT including automation, robotics, and intelligent platforms. We are helping a global healthcare company embrace digital across its entire enterprise. Ultimately using Accenture myWizard, our intelligence automation platform to improve application quality and productivity. We are working with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to modernize the enterprise applications using Agile and DevOps software development. And during the quarter we expanded our capabilities in intelligent automation with the acquisition of Genfour in the UK and earlier this month we acquired SolutionsIQ, a leading provider of Agile services adding some of the most experienced Agile coaches in the industry to our team.","We continued to hold a unique position in the technology echo system as the leading partner of both the established providers and emerging players. Just last week Microsoft named Accenture it's SI partner of the year for the tenth year in a row. In May we received three SAP pinnacle awards more than any other company for our work helping clients design, deploy, and manage SAP enterprise systems. And we have expanded our collaboration with SAP to co-innovate, co-develop, and jointly go-to-market with new solutions that combine our industry expertise and analytics capabilities with SAP Leonardo, the new system that integrates digital technologies including match and learning, analytics, and Internet of Things.","Turning out to the geographic dimensions of our business and our results for the quarter, in North America we delivered revenue growth of 3% in local currency driven by United States. As David mentioned this was below our expectations given the increased uncertainty in the marketplace in health and public service related to healthcare legislation and State and Federal projects. In Europe I am very pleased that we had another strong performance growing revenue 9% in local currency driven primarily by double-digit growth in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. And in gross markets we delivered another excellent quarter with 13% growth in local currency led by very strong double-digit growth in Japan [ph] as well as double-digit growth in Australia as well as in Singapore.","Before I hand it back to David, I want to take a moment to acknowledge some of the external recognition we have received for our brand and differentiated strategy. And again we never take this for granted. I am delighted that for the 12th year in a row we were recognized on BrandZ's list of the top 100 most valuable global brand. As well for the sixth consecutive year we were included in Forbes ranking of the top global brands. We improved our rankings and drove significant increases in brand value on both lists. And for the second year in a row we were among the top 25 companies on the Barron's 500 and we were also included on Barron's list of most respected companies.","I strongly really believe that over the years we have built a durable business model for Accenture based on two major building blocks. First, our accelerated rotation to The New which enhances our relevance to clients. And second, our highly diverse portfolio of business which enables us to drive durable performance of a cycle of uncertainty and volatility. And that is why looking ahead I remain very confident in our business strategy and our market position. With that I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David. ","David P. Rowland","Thank you Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.85 billion to $9.10 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2017 based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 1% compared to fiscal 2016. For the full fiscal 2017 we now expect our net revenues to be in the range of 6% to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal 2016. For operating margin on an adjusted basis we now expect fiscal year 2017 to be 14.8%, a 20 basis point expansion over fiscal 2016 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. ","Our earnings per share on an adjusted basis we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $5.84 to $5.91 or 9% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal 2016 results. For the full fiscal 2017 we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be in the range of 600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. We continue to expect to return at least 4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning substantial portion of the cash to shareholders. And finally for the full year we now expect to invest in the range of $1.8 billion in acquisitions. With that let's open it up so we can take your questions. Angie.","Angie Park","Thanks David. I would ask that you each stick to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Ryan would you provide instructions for those on the call. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Hey, good morning, thanks. Just let me start by asking about bookings. Bookings were good and in line with where we were at, you said it would improve in the second half, it did in the third quarter, do you expect that momentum to carry into the fourth quarter, have you replenished the pipeline, etc. going into 4Q? ","David P. Rowland","Yeah we still hate tension by the way. We feel good about our bookings position in the fourth quarter and we expect to have another very good quarter of bookings. So we think that momentum does continue. ","Tien-Tsin Huang","Okay and then on just The New revenue here versus the, I guess you want to call it legacy or The Not New, any surprise in the trend there, just thinking about the math and if there's been any change in momentum in either? ","David P. Rowland","Well, I would say on that front it's really been more of the same. Our growth in The New continues to go at very, very high levels, well above 30% growth in the quarter which is what we've seen pretty consistently this year. The market demand is tremendous and it plays extremely well to the investments that we've made over the last several years now and building capabilities to be the leader in that part of the marketplace. So we're extremely pleased it is broad based literally across our operating groups, our 15 geographic units. And if you look at the three components of digital, cloud, and security again, very strong double-digit growth really across the board. So we couldn't be more pleased with what we see in that part of our business.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Edward Caso","Hi, good morning. I was curious about your efforts on the acquisition front. Obviously you're providing all your cash flow back to investors and therefore using the cash on your balance sheet to fund your fairly aggressive acquisition program. At what point do you hit a level where you desire to have your cash?","David P. Rowland","Well I think -- and we've talked about this before and we are fortunate in that with the strength of our overall financials including our balance sheet we have a lot of levers at our disposal as we manage our business really for many years to come. When we look out our need to acquire critical skills and capabilities in important growth areas in the market, we don't see that changing certainly over the next three years. And so we think that's going to continue to be an important part of our investment strategy. We think it will be an important part of an engine for growth overall and ultimately for us. As you know, this is all about quickly assimilating these capabilities and driving organic growth over time. So we really see more of the same with our acquisition strategy going forward, and we think we have the financial flexibility to accommodate that while also returning cash to shareholders. ","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah, not much to add, I think we have an extremely clear strategy at Accenture, which is all about rotating to The New, and in order to enable this strategy, we have set very clear financial context we shared with all of you on how we are going to locate our cash and our free cash flow with this rate, at the same time investing more than ever to the transformation of Accenture to give the relevant services of the future and create durable performance over the next cycle of change and at the same time continuing with very, I guess very good return to shareholder approach, both in term of share buyback and in terms of dividends. So we believe that this strategy is playing very well, and as David mentioned we still have opportunities to invest even more should that be required leveraging more our balance sheets one way or the other. So I feel extremely good with where we are from an investment standpoint, from a financial standpoint, and from our strategic allocation of cash. ","Edward Caso","My other related question is around the assimilation of these employees, these are generally smaller, more entrepreneurial firms that generally have a different character of employee than a traditional Accenture trained and developed person. Can you give us any sense for the attrition at these acquired companies that are relative to the base and how you're managing that? Thank you. ","Pierre Nanterme","Thanks for the question because it was -- when we decided our new strategy of rotating to The New that was clearly a big question we had in front of us. We benefit from Accenture from a very strong culture, you know, very well based on what we've been doing for multiple decades. And when you are rotating to The New and The New is still different in terms of you mentioned digital, we are talking about the millennium, but again in terms of disciplines such as design-led thinking such as experience driven projects such as prototyping, such as being more Agile, DevOps, no doubt you need to attract people who are going to be different from where you are. And simply said, we make what I think is a very profound and important evolution in our industry which is creating this concept of Accenture, we have a culture of cultures. So we celebrate the diversity of the cultures, so we are extremely respectful of the cultural field which is our design, digital marketing organization with now thousand people. We have the largest digital design studio in the world.","We are extremely respectful of the people we are hiring from security. As you know that well and I would not elaborate these people are different in the security specs and they're walking like a tribe around their own discipline and we are extremely respectful to keep that culture. That's why we created end-to-end Accenture Security under the leadership of Kelly Bissell, an incredibly strong security leader on the side by Omar Abbosh our Chief Strategy Officer. So we developed this culture, this concept of culture of cultures, very different from this old and I think outdated concept of one culture. ","On the other end we are extremely stringent on our values and we are making a big difference around cultures. They have to be different which is what is bringing richness in our company and innovation but the values shouldn\u2019t be compromised and are not for negotiation. And the values at Accenture we will never negotiate with respect for individual inclusion and diversity, ethics, compliance, client first, stewardship, and all of this has nothing to do with culture. It's just the appropriate business and personnel behavior you and I and everybody on the planet should develop. And I think we have been very good in creating and developing this culture of cultures concept and right David, all the integration we made, all but I am not saying that's likely been successful. ","David P. Rowland","Yeah, are we carefully manage the retention of the people in these companies that we acquire and our performance have really over the last three years in terms of retaining talent has been very good.","Edward Caso","Thank you. ","David P. Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead. ","David P. Rowland","Good morning Bryan. ","Bryan Bergin","Thank you. As the number comes from majority share of your business how should we think about potential changes and corporate revenue trajectory or particularly margin expansion, do you foresee any inflection in item over the medium-term?","Pierre Nanterme","You know, again I will stop short of saying anything that would imply guidance for next year or beyond. But I would say that broadly speaking if you look at two of our three overriding financial objectives the first one being to drop durable growth which is consistently above the market, as I said taking share and extending our position as a market leader. And in the second overriding objective which is consistent, modest margin expansion while investing in increasing scale in our business and driving EPS growth faster than revenue growth we remain committed to those as kind of multi-year objectives that we work very hard to achieve. And I think the rotation to the new creates more opportunity for achieving those as opposed to a threat. So that is -- I think it gives us better positioning and a better opportunity to continue to deliver on those overtime.","Bryan Bergin","Okay, and just a follow up then, just as far as expanding into some of our markets, interactive business I thought was a great example of getting you access into an area within the same office. Are there other areas that you're potentially looking at within client wallets that are logical extensions that you might be targeting?","Pierre Nanterme","Security is another one with the business resulting with Accenture Security. Clearly we are expanding our access to new leaders. Given the depth and breadth of all services you are absolutely right, it is our ambition to increase the coverage of the leaders we might serve with clients from the CEO, the CFO, the COO, the CIO. Now the Chief Digital Officer with the launch of Accenture Digital, you know, there are new leaders under this terminology and we want to be the top choice for the newly appointed CDOs which should be a quite a natural act. You mentioned the CMOs with what we are doing with Accenture Interactive. And we have all the business in the different parts of the business. So if I am looking at Accenture we have now settled with the five businesses. We have in this businesses you have all the activities such as analytics, interactive, mobility, cloud, security. I could mention Accenture Credit services. We are in the U.S. which is providing access in banks to credit part of the organization and I mentioned a lot. So I guess and I would claim that we are settling the organization in professional services which today broader access to any client leadership group. ","Bryan Bergin","Thank you. ","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning guys. I am good. So question just around the mix of business. So I noticed GDN mix down ticked slightly this quarter that's quite unusual. I think that's the first time in years that's happened. And at the same time you had a really strong headcount growth quarter at over 10% but then David in your comments you called out that you're seeing very strong growth in The New in areas like application and services which suggests more like build related activities which I would associate with offshore. So kind of two part question coming out of that; one, are you with the strong headcount growth and GDN mix that are stabilizing are we going to see an acceleration in revenue per head that might cause some break in the linearly in the business? And then also just secondarily can you just talk a little bit about the mix of the type of work you're seeing in The New as it gets to be over 50% of the business and if that's sort of fundamentally different in terms of mix of service lines relative to the core? ","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah maybe I get a start with our strategic direction on this. We are working extremely hard as you know at Accenture on robotic automation and bringing intelligent capabilities to significantly improve our productivity especially where we have large-scale operations so with technology and in operations. So we are working hard on what you said how we are moving forward we're going to have less direct correlation between revenue and headcount. And clearly the big game on this is to accelerate our investments in robotic automation and intelligent services which is exactly [indiscernible] for Accenture Technology and Debbie Polyshoot [ph] for Accenture Operation are working extremely hard. And we are starting to see some very encouraging results where we could drive more revenues with a bit less people in some part of Accenture Operations and in some part of our BPO. We are starting to feel the support of inflection. Certainly we need another year or 18 months to see whether this trend might accelerate and change the dynamic between revenue and headcount growth which is something of course we are pursuing systematically. ","On the second question what is the complexion of our work in term with The New. I mean the good news is we were taking everything to The New, strategy, consulting, digital of course, technology, and operations. And all our services in The New are going very well. Strategy and consulting growth in The New is double-digit. But as well it is driving significant growth in Accenture Technology and in our platforms if I am looking at the business with driving analytics through SAP Hana and tomorrow with SAP Leonardo is driving significant growth in the new SAP, in the new Microsoft, in the new Oracle. And I can mention -- and I could mention others but as well it is creating activities in operations. I am thinking about what we're doing in customer analytics leading to Accenture Analytics or to Accenture Interactive it is driving business with platform as a service in terms of analytics what we are calling Accenture Analytics insight platform. This is a service which is directly linked to the new services we are providing from an analytical standpoint. So it's really The New is driving growth in each of our five business in a very meaningful way. And we love that. ","David P. Rowland","Yeah, and Lisa I would say that you may remember that it was the third quarter of last year and then again in the fourth quarter where I had made comments that we were starting to see an improving trend and the progression of revenue per billable head. And so you asked will we start to see that, I think we have seen instances of that if you look over the last three or four quarters. The other thing just to remind you and others who are looking at the headcount numbers GDN includes our locations around the world including GDN headcount and let's say the more mature markets. And so GDN is in the United States as an example it's not just India and the Philippines.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thanks. And just one quick follow up Pierre I think on your comment there on The New. So would you characterize at this point if you just compared this year versus maybe like this time last year or two years ago that the mix of work in The New now is much more diverse across your service lines, you're fully into what I'd call more like build and run activities? ","Pierre Nanterme","Absolutely right, and I think we see and I'm pleased with that we see this new maturing. So as all services you have a kind of maturity curve where you are starting with more pioneering strategy consulting rich programs, kind of prototyping in the early phase of the maturity curve. What we see is now all these New capabilities, I'm thinking about interactivity, mobility, identity, cloud, security soon come into traffic artificial intelligent block chain and immersive reality and certainly in the near future quantum computing. All of this new capabilities are getting more mature, are driving on balance bigger programs, and as we are moving from small prototyping to bigger programs suddenly it is expanding in several service lines from strategy to consulting but as well to technology and to operations. So we -- this business is maturing very well at Accenture with a positive effect in all our five businesses if you will and indeed we see more bigger deals which is a sign of the market maturing.","David P. Rowland","Thank you Lisa. ","Operator","Our next question comes on of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys, wanted to ask about the Accenture business dimensions, the growth rates there have surprised me. I guess on one hand app services which grew mid single-digits in fiscal year 2016 has gone up to high single-digits and I know there's a lot of worries in the marketplace about a secular decline in that business so that's been a surprise on the positive end. And then on the other strategy and consulting which grew double-digits in fiscal year 2016 is kind of hovering below kind of my expectations at low single-digits. So just trying to understand the strength in app services versus the weakness in strategy and consulting? ","David P. Rowland","Yeah, I think when you -- I will make a few comments and Pierre may have some as well. But first of all when you look at app services it's important to focus on the point that our growth is coming from the higher value application engineering, systems integration type work that is driven by the adoption of new IT in this rotations of The New. And so to some extent it kind of ties back to Lisa's question and Pierre's answer is that what you're starting to see is the adoption rate of new IT and digital broadly is increasing. You're starting in our business to see more systems integration application work associated with the implementation of digital technologies, new IP, etc and I think that is really what's driving our application services. ","We've said before, Pierre has said many times that our strategy in app services is to rapidly grow and expand in the SI space. The application outsourcing is a different marketplace, it is largely commoditized, and we will continue to have an application maintenance footprint but our application services business is really all about the systems integration, application engineering, enabling the adoption of new IT and digital technologies for our clients. And that's reflected in the pickup in growth rates. ","Maybe just one more comment on the strategy and consulting combined again that can ebb and flow. Pierre also eluded earlier and it's worth noting again is that you really have to decompose the strategy consulting number to really understand what's going on. And if you look at our strategy and consulting business that is related to projects in The New that part of strategy and consulting is growing mid teens. So let's say in the 15% kind range. So it's a very, very strong growth for those services related to enabling The New with our clients. The area that is not as robust right now let's say is the more traditional strategy and consulting that is not specifically tied to this rotation to The New.","Bryan Keane","Okay, that's helpful and then just as a follow up on contributions of acquisitions. How much did acquisitions contribute to the quarterly revenue growth and I know we talked about 2.5 points for the back half of the year, I don't know since you took up the amount that you were going to spend on acquisitions I think it went up to a little bit to 1.8 billion from 1.5 billion, if that changed anything for the outlook? Thanks so much. ","David P. Rowland","You know that does have materially changed the number because obviously we're acquiring these -- let's say that increases more in the back of the last three months of the year. So that has more of an impact on 2018 than it does this year. Having said that we still think we're going to be at roughly in the ballpark of 2% for the full year. Previously I have said the back half of the year would be 2.5%. It will be just incrementally kind of above that but not materially above that. So clearly it is consistent with what I have said before, a slightly higher in the back half of the year than the 2.5%.","Bryan Keane","Okay, thanks so much. I'm just curious on the third quarter itself, was it up to 2.5 points so far or not quite yet?","David P. Rowland","Yeah, in that zone. ","Bryan Keane","Okay, thanks so much. ","David P. Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes on of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David P. Rowland","Good morning Jim. ","Jim Schneider","Hello, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the North America piece of the business, what are you hearing from clients just broadly speaking, can you maybe just kind of give us a sense about whether the North America slowdown was purely isolated to the health and public service area or what you are hearing from clients generally and what you expect that to be kind of like a one off one quarter thing or something that could continue for a couple of quarters? ","David P. Rowland","First of all as it relates to our expectations and then Pierre may add some comments as well. But let me just deal with the results relative to our expectations. So we had seen slower growth in H&PS in quarter one and quarter two. You will remember quarter two was a 2% which is where we ended up and not in quarter three. We had expected not based on hope but based on what we felt was kind of tangible evidence in the second quarter that we were going to see an uptick in growth in the third quarter in the second half of the year and that's what I called out 90 days ago. What we saw was that, that uptick if you will or that freeing up of the initiation of new projects and let's say a return to more normal decision making patterns on contracting new work, that just simply did not improve as we had expected. And so if you look at North America and the difference between where we landed and where we expected to land, the difference is the vast majority of that is in health and public service for the reasons I mentioned in the script. It's the difference between North America growth being at 3% and 5% order of magnitude. And it was the difference -- it was probably a point of growth, it was a point of growth at the expense level in total. So it was meaningful. Having said that we have a very strong health and public service practice and at some point the logjam will break and work will be initiated and we will be right there and again when that happens. And of course broadly in North America we feel that way as well. ","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, absolutely right and I understand you are asking this question on North America. For me on the positive side we continue to grow more than the market and gaining significant market share in North America despite the fact that the level of growth is lower at the level of growth of the market as we are analyzing it as well as slowing down. Secondly our rotation to The New in North America is excellent and we're going to get close to 50% as with the rest of Accenture. So we have zero issues in terms of executing our strategy. And three, we continue to invest. So we are not changing our investment profile and we believe it's the right time to invest, to be prepared for the future and to be prepared when the market will be good again. ","Now what is the situation and indeed a big difference from what we expected three months ago, these annual, you should probably know, when you are in the U.S. and French you are probably have a certainly better informed point of view on this but there is an expectation that indeed the new administration will launch critical reforms in order to boost the business and economy growth. And this economic reform probably I would say the one which are the most important, the healthcare reform, the tax reform, the trade reform and anything linked to the infrastructure investments. And all of these four were the ones supposed to indeed unleash more growth for the business so the business could invest and drive more growth. And by driving more growth and driving more investment we would have a positive impact. ","Fact of the matter of is that we don't do this to be honest, three months ago because just rating the observers and all the analytics we believe that these four reforms would happen reasonably rapidly in the U.S. And fact of the matter they are not yet being announced or executed and so we are in this zone where the business is still waiting, it's still positive but waiting for these reforms to happen, to invest and so which has a negative effect especially on H&PS which has been the vertical more impacted by this kind of wait and see mode on what could happen with the reform. And we are ready to in fact in these couple of quarters the overall profit for services market in the U.S. been slowing down. And so to some extent we are moderating with the market while continuing to do much better than the market. And so I am positive that when the market will be back because that will happen we are in better position than anyone else given the investment and the positioning we are taking. So I'm looking that with my French glasses and I would encourage the U.S. to accelerate their reforms. ","David P. Rowland","And as I said it's a perfect illustration though of the power of the diversity of our model where Europe and the growth markets combined in the third quarter and grew double-digits 10%. And so that is intentionally the way our business is constructed for this exact reason. And so it is working as designed. ","Pierre Nanterme","And it's interesting to see, sorry to elaborate, but I think it's important for all the people listening to the call because you might wonder is why things are doing so well in Europe. We have 9% growth and you know it is -- but I think in Europe you have less uncertainties now. I think we had good prospect that probably Germany might re-elect Angela Merkel so it's a poll of stability. I guess, the election of Emmanuel Macron in France has been recognized and celebrated by the market because he is pro-European which has created a very positive impact around whether Europe will disappear or not. ","I think Germany and France are being extraordinary for business is recreating a very solid coalition and the Brexit thing is moving at its pace but the place we know it is going to happen. So it's not an uncertainty. The uncertainty is what exactly, is it going to be hard, soft, gentle probably the European will figure out as a -- or we can figure it out over centuries. But it's interesting if you take China. China I guess not much uncertainty. The credibility is very clear on what it wants to achieve, it's driving these five years of reform program. So you see what I mean. It's interesting that there is one place, it is a big place in the world where you have this kind of wait for the reforms to happen it is currently in the United States. But I am personally feeling very good that these reforms will happen and the business will pick up again.","Jim Schneider","That that's helpful, thank you for the color. And just as a quick follow up going back to the M&A question for a second, if you look at the run rate of M&A that you are doing in Q4 this year, would you expect that to accelerate incrementally from here getting into fiscal 2018? And then I think Pierre you made an allusion to using the balance sheet for M&A, does that imply you're willing to put some debt on the balance sheet to finance more M&A at this point? ","David P. Rowland","I think as it relates to your last question we said consistently for as long as I can remember that we always I mean we're well aware of that being an option and given the right circumstances we would have no concern about doing that. And we would as we always do we would make very smart decisions as to when and at what level we do that. But that is certainly an option that is open to us and we have no concerns at all about using that option given the right circumstances. ","Pierre Nanterme","I mean so far we said, I mean David and I we are extremely disciplined. And our financial model is extremely clear and has been communicated to all of you. We expect 20% to 30% of our annual growth to be driven by acquisitions. Our growth is 70% to 80% organic. Let's be clear and frequent from that and 20% to 30% of annual growth my counter acquisitions depending on the opportunities. These things are lumpy so about that we expect that anything between 20% to 35% every year of free cash flow will be dedicated to acquisition and the right as we do would be a return to our shareholders in a program which I think is extremely attractive to all of you with the mix share buyback and dividend. ","So this is our ongoing thesis from a financial algorithm if you will. Now we have opportunities by leveraging more to balance it to if we have any relevant opportunities that would bring differentiation that would be more transformation, more leadership in The New. In some spaces it could be artificial intelligence, factoring immersive realities, quantum computing, would say what to make some significant steps. But so far we are with our ongoing thesis I just mentioned before and we are very pleased with where we are and I'm very pleased that we have what we need if we have for good reasons to move faster or make different transactions. ","Jim Schneider","Thank you. ","David P. Rowland","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Koning with Baird. Please go ahead. ","David Koning","Yeah, hey guys, thank you. I guess first of all just when we think of The New I think you said about 50% of revs now when we looked back a year ago was about 40% of revs. So it's growing like 25% to 30%, something like that whereas the rest the business is declining high single-digits it looks like. Is that just existing clients are just shifting their preferences rather than really some of that old stuff just going away, it's just a shift? And then I guess second, to that overall growth has decelerated a little bit, is that because of the yield on some of the new projects are a little less than some of the legacy?","David P. Rowland","You know first of all when you look at overall growth, when we provide a guidance of 5 to 8 at the beginning of the year and of course we're going to land very solidly within that range we have said that growing double-digits each and every year is just an unrealistic expectation. We worked hard to drive as much growth as we can but each and every year we're not going to drop double-digit growth. And we think that we look at our growth rate against what the market is growing and in a market that lets say generally has grown let's say anywhere in the 2.5% to 4% range, let's say if you looked over the last two to three years if we're growing 7% as we are this year we're growing two times the rate of the market growth. And so are we lower than where we were double-digit growth, the last two years, we are but we're growing two times the rate of overall market growth which is clearly the indicator of a leader in the sector. And so that's what we're all about and growth in the 5% to 8% range where we've got to 6% to 7% growth is actually quite strong growth in the market. ","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah, I mean we are just reflecting on when I'm looking at the performance of the company and we are in the right place or not I mean summarizing what we are really doing at Accenture we said our revenue would be in the range of 5% to 8%, right David, I mean so far we are at 7%, right in the zone. Then the question might be is 7 good or not. The only way to understand whether 7 is good or not is to compare with the rest of the market. And we believe that at 7% we're growing twice the market and growing twice the market for a company of our size is an incredible positive results. ","Second, part of our philosophy as well, at the same time our revenues are growing 7%, our EPS is growing 10%. We're growing the EPS more than our revenues and again I think it's a sign of good financial performance. I remember that it said we want to grow EPS at the same rate as our revenues. We are growing EPS even slightly higher than the revenue which is of course an exceptional performance from David. And then for me David is taking care of the numbers and I am taking care of the strategy that's why we have -- we are a good duo. For me if there is a highlight for this quarter and I hope that's the one you're going to take, is this 50%. ","There are all sorts of metrics, all sort of numbers there which I think are all landing in the right place. We are probably beating our guidance, we said three months ago on each and every dimension and providing extraordinary good financial. But then what's important I think for all of you and for me, are we executing this strategy which is going to create a new Accenture which could be competitive for the future. And again it is a yes, that's why I wanted to put even in the announcement for the first time outside in what according to figures we had that we hit the milestone of 50% and I would like all of us analyst, investors because you're putting a lot of confidence on Accenture to celebrate this milestone because it's a very big and important milestone for us at Accenture. We will properly celebrate in Boston with a very nice glass of Coca-Cola among other things by the way because we are still humble so no champagne yet. But it is very important jokes apart. I mean imagine what it is in 44 years we are rotating 50% of the business of the company of $35 billion to The New. ","That's what has been achieved and we're not going to stop there. We will continue accelerating because we won by 20:20 towards the vast majority of our revenues being in The New. This might turn 50% was for me at least was for me the highlight of the quarter and I hope it is as well something you will consider extremely important in the successful execution of our strategy together with the rights to very strong financial performance. ","Pierre Nanterme","So that being said thanks again for joining us on today's call. I mean needless to say and with a few words I just said before the conclusion that I and the leadership team of Accenture we feel good about where we are. We feel good about where we are because we continue to build on our strong position in the marketplace, I mean what we have said. We are rotating our business to The New which is now 50% of our revenues and again I would like to pound that because for me it's exceptional. We are gaining significant market share growing in average twice as fast as the market and I think this is very noticeable in each and every market if you look at this. ","North America, Europe, and the gross market, the minimum is twice the market. In some markets we're growing much more than twice, sometimes four times the market and we continue to gain market share. And we continue and this is where I'm delighted with what we're doing, we continue to invest in new capabilities to drive future growth and to create the future of that company while delivering value for all of you but as well for all our stakeholders including 4000 people who are working every day very hard to transform the company and make Accenture the partner of choice for many of our clients. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime if you have any questions please feel free to call Angie and the team. All the best and talk to you very soon.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations, KC McClure. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Brad and thanks everyone for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings announcement. As Brad just mentioned, I am KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015.

As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC and thanks everyone for joining us today. We are extremely pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, continuing our momentum from the first quarter. Our strong performance in the second quarter was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business and we gained significant market-share. Here are a few highlights, let me start with our new bookings of $9.4 billion, our second highest quarterly bookings ever. This brings us to 17 billion for the first half and positions us well for the year.","We delivered very strong revenue growth of 12% in local currency with double-digit growth in both consulting and outsourcing. Earnings per share were $1.08, a 5% increase. We expanded operating margin 30 basis points to 13.6%. Our balance sheet remained very strong ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion and we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today we announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share which will bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.04 per share, a 10% increase over last year. So with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our results and the momentum we\u2019re creating in our business and we\u2019ve again raised our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year, over to you David.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre and thanks all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As you heard in Pierre\u2019s comments, we delivered a very strong second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of strong and building momentum in our business as we continue to execute a growth strategy that\u2019s clearly resonating in the marketplace. During this period, we\u2019ve gained significant market share by being relevant and responsive to the needs of our clients.","Looking more specifically at the second quarter, following a strong start for the year in quarter one, we again delivered on all three imperatives for driving shareholder value. Our 12% growth which continued to be broad-based across almost every dimension of our business reflects the durability of our revenue growth model as we drive growth at scale. Our operating margin of 13.6%, 30 basis points higher than last year demonstrates the success of the actions underway to improve profitability and reflects our ability to manage our business to drive sustainable margin expansions and our free cash flow of 220 million was consistent with our expectations and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver free cash flow and excess net income for the full year while returning significant cash to shareholders.","So, we were extremely pleased with the second quarter, very strong growth, strong margin expansion and cash flow consistent with our expectations. With that said, let's now turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were 9.4 billion for the quarter as Pierre said representing the second highest quarter in our history. Consulting bookings were 4.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1, outsourcing bookings were 5.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.4. On a year-to-date basis bookings are now just over 17 billion, a very healthy level especially when considering the FX impact and puts us within our target book-to-bill range for both consulting and outsourcing. Taking a closer look at our quarter two bookings, an important theme was the continued strong demand for both digital related services and operations.","At the same time we saw very good demand for both application services and consulting related services. Another important characteristic was the broad-based nature of the uptick in new bookings with sequential improvement in bookings across all operating groups and all three geographic areas. Finally, we were pleased that we had a record 15 clients with bookings in excess of 100 million which points to the strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive the most important initiatives on their agenda.","Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were 7.49 billion, an increase of 5% U.S. dollars and 12% local currency reflecting a negative 6.5% foreign exchange impact compared to the negative 5% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the additional FX headwind we came in well above the top-end of our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were 3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were 3.7 billion, up 6% in USD and 13% in local currency.","Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter, we saw consistent trends with our most recent quarters. The dominant drivers were strong double-digit growth in digital related services, operations and application services, and it\u2019s also noteworthy that our results reflected an uptick in growth rates in both strategy and consulting services which are now growing at mid single-digits.","Turning to the operating groups, Communications, Media and Technology delivered another quarter of 15% growth, which continue to be broad-based with almost all dimensions growing double-digits. The strongest growth drivers continue to be digital related services, cost rationalization and several large transformational projects, as well as increasing demand for network related services. H&PS also grew 15% in the quarter and the drivers continue to be very significant growth in our health business, particularly in the public sector, driven by our health exchange and Medicaid related projects at U.S. federal and state clients.","Digital related services and operations, particularly in BPO, continue to be very significant drivers of growth as well. Products growth of 13% continued to reflect strong and balanced growth across all three geographic regions and most industries. Digital and cost optimization were significant areas of focus for clients in this operating group as well, application services was also a driver as well as very strong overall growth in consulting.","Financial services grew 9% led by strong growth in Europe and across all three industries particularly in capital markets and insurance. Digital related services continue to be a major theme as our clients are looking for new and innovative ways to connect with their customers and serve their needs. Additionally cost optimization and risk and regulatory work continue to be significant areas of focus. Resources grew 6% with growth in all three geographic regions and all industries except energy. Revenues were driven by growth in outsourcing across all industries including energy as clients focus on operational efficiency and cost rationalization.","Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 29.9% compared with 31.3% for the same period last year down 140 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7% of net revenues compared with 11.7% of net revenues for the second quarter last year down 100 basis points. General administrative expense was 5.6% of net revenues compared with 6.2% of net revenues for the second quarter last year down 60 basis points. Operating income was $1 billion in the second quarter reflecting a 13.6% operating margin up 30 basis points compared with quarter two last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% compared with an effective tax rate of 24% in the second quarter last year. Net income was 743 million for the second quarter compared with net income of 722 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.08 compared with EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter last year. This reflects a 5% year-over-year increase.","Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry leading, they were 35 days down from 37 days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was 220 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of 301 million net of property and equipment additions of 82 million. As I mentioned in quarter one, we shifted the timing of a portion of our compensation payments from quarter one to quarter two. While this shift negatively impacted the second quarter there is no impact to full year cash flow.","Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at February 28th was 4.1 billion compared with 4.9 billion at August 31st last year down 800 million as we\u2019ve returned 1.9 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in the first half of fiscal \u201915. Moving to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 323,000 people, we now have approximately 226,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter two, our utilization was 91% consistent with last quarter, attrition which excludes involuntary terminations was 14%, compared to 13% quarter one and 12% in the same period last year. Lastly, we continue to expect at least 90,000 people will join our company in fiscal \u201915.","Turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter we repurchased or redeemed approximately 6.8 million shares for $601 million, in an average price of $87.72 per share. Year-to-date, we purchased 15.2 million for approximately $1.3 billion, at an average price of 83.62 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately 3.7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Finally as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.02 per share representing a 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year. The dividend will be paid on May 15, 2015. So with two quarters in the books, we\u2019ve delivered very strong results and feel positive about how we\u2019re positioned for the remainder of the year. That said, we don\u2019t take anything for granted, we continue to drive our business with rigor and discipline doing everything possible to deliver strong second half for the year.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. We are adjusting very well against our growth strategies and taking a leadership position in each of the businesses in our portfolio. The investment we\u2019ve made in assets and solutions, in strategic acquisitions, in attracting talent and in building the skills and capabilities of our people has positioned us very well to capture new growth opportunities. We are driving innovation across Accenture to grow capabilities that are both highly relevant to our clients and highly differentiated in the marketplace.","You have heard me mention two important trends, digitization and rationalization that are driving demand for our services and contributing to our growth. We invested ahead of the curve to build a capability that will help our clients respond to these trends. Digitization is all about helping our clients tap into new sources of value and new sources of revenue to create competitive advantage. We are helping clients capitalize on these trends to become the disrupters in the new digital world, not the disruptive. A great example is to what we are doing with a leading retailer helping them on vision on finding new ways to attract customers and achieve that goal of quadrupling revenue. We are bringing innovative digital technology to help them move beyond the traditional store model to a multichannel digital strategy.","For a global telecommunications provider, we developed a digital strategy underpinned by analytics to significantly upgrade their customer service, while delivering cost savings of almost $100 million. We are also walking with our clients to develop innovative products and services based on the Internet-of-things. We are helping Visa explore the future of mobile payments to make their traffic more convenient even inside a car, leveraging our expertise in digital commerce we build a proof-of-concept to show our consumers in a Connected Car, you can order and pay for it securely. Digital services represent about 20% of our total revenues and were more than 20% in local currency in the first half of the year. We are seeing demand for digital across all dimensions of the business in every industry and around the world and we\u2019re clearly benefitting from the investment we have made in this space.","In January, we acquired Structure a Houston based firm that will further enhance our smart grid operations, energy trading and rich management services for utilities and energy clients. In February, we announced the acquisition of Agilex Technologies, a provider of digital solutions for the U.S. federal government. The acquisition enhances our digital capabilities in analytics, cloud and mobility for federal agencies. And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Gapso, a Brazilian analytics firm that will expand our advanced analytics capabilities in the supply chain and logistic areas.","The second thing rationalization continues to be top of mind for clients as they look for opportunities to increase productivity and efficiency across their organizations. We have invested to take a leadership position in this space with Accenture operations. And we are the first company to combine business process services with infrastructure and cloud services at scale. We\u2019re working with a leading global airline on a major transformation of its procurement function, including a cloud-based supplier portal. The alliance expects to realize significant cost savings as well as increased standardization and transparency.","We are helping a global beverage company to create a global operating hub for finance and accounting, HR, procurement, supply chain and marketing operations. Our multi tower BPO services will streamline processes, minimize risk and provide new analytical insights. And we are working with a leading European manufacturer to transform its IT infrastructure. We will migrate existing applications and data services across more than 60 operating companies into a single hybrid cloud environment. We expect to deliver improved services and flexibility, increased automation and a 30% reduction in operating costs.","Now turning to the geographic dimension of our business, in the second quarter we again delivered very strong growth across all three of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered revenue growth of 13% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in the United States where we continue to perform extremely well. In Europe we grew revenues 9% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in many of our largest markets including France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. And in our growth markets, we grew revenues 12% in local currency with again strong double-digit growth in three of our largest markets, Japan, Australia and Brazil.","So, as you can see, we have delivered an excellent first half of this fiscal year. Our diverse portfolio of business together with our geographic diversity and our unique ability to integrate our capabilities end-to-end positions us very well to bring innovative services to market leading companies both globally and locally. Looking ahead, based on the successful execution of our growth strategy, I feel confident in our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth over the long-term providing value to our clients, our people and our shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year \u201915, David over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Let me turn now to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal \u201915, we expect revenues to be in the range of 7.35 billion to 7.6 billion. This assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 11% compared to the third quarter of fiscal \u201914.","For the full fiscal year \u201915, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 8% compared to fiscal \u201914. For the full fiscal \u201915, we now expect our net revenues to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal \u201914. For the full fiscal year \u201915, we now expect new bookings to be in the range of 33 billion to 35 billion reflecting our revised FX assumptions.","Before I continue with our business outlook, I\u2019d like to comment briefly on a non-cash item that will be recorded in the third quarter. In May, we expect to record a non-cash settlement charge estimated to be approximately $60 million as a result of a current offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. This will reduce future risk and administrative cost to Accenture. On a GAAP basis for fiscal \u201915, the estimated impact of this settlement charge is approximately 20 basis points to operating margin and approximately $0.05 in EPS. We will provide both GAAP and adjusted results for quarter three and year-to-date results.","For operating margin on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal \u201915 to be 14.4% to 14.6% a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal \u201914 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal \u201915 to be in the range of $4.66 to $4.76 or 3% to 5% growth over fiscal \u201914 results. Absent the higher FX headwind which impacts EPS by $0.14 our EPS range would have increased $0.10 to $0.14 driven by high revenue growth.","Turning to cash flow for the full fiscal \u201915, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of 3.85 billion to 4.15 billion reflecting our revised FX assumption. Property and equipment additions continue to be approximately 450 million and free cash flow now to be in the range of 3.4 billion to 3.7 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least 3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s open it up so that we can take your questions, KC?","KC McClure","Thanks David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Brad, would you provide instructions for those on the call please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Of course. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","I was wondering could you provide a little more color on your exposure to digital just give us some sense of what you expect the growth rates to be there and how should we think about that as it relates to bookings as far as the size of the deals and the market contribution? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","I will take the first part of it and indeed as we\u2019ve communicated recently and even this last year, we earn back in rotating more of our business to what we are calling now digital related services. Digital is positive across the board, this is something we anticipated frankly few years ago probably in the range of 29 and we invested a lot ahead of the curve. If you remember around what we are calling interactive analytics, cloud and mobility and now indeed we are significantly benefitted from this wave which is very important that\u2019s why I was very pleased and proud to report our position in term of digital related services. Now at 20% of Accenture revenues in that short period in time and as important and even more important well above 20% local currency growth for the first half of the year. So needless to say that we have a great momentum in that business and indeed its covering a large value of opportunities small, medium, large covering consulting or outsourcing type of work. So digital is positive across a different dimension of our businesses, consulting outsourcing across all industries there are more or less around the 20% some above, a few slightly below and on balance I guess David will comment good pricing.","David Rowland","Yes and I think, I mean just as it relates to the bookings question and a peer alluded to this is that, the digital bills do span all sizes. We have larger digital projects and obviously we have a high volume of medium size to smaller project. And I guess what I would say is that you might think about it in the context of the quarter we just delivered, where we delivered 9.4 billion in bookings with a heavy component of digital. And so, I don\u2019t think that this necessarily changes anything in terms of that dynamic overall.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, just to add piece of information on this, as you know we created as well Accenture Digital where we have organized our Accenture interactive, Accenture mobility and Accenture analytics work and what we are aiming at through Accenture way is to create more and more synergies integration end-to-end of the three capabilities and that\u2019s a unique differentiator in the marketplace.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang","I wanted to ask on the bookings side, just the 15 clients that did bookings over $100 million. That was a big number obviously. Can you comment on the types of deals, geographies, maybe pricing any common theme there and does this in any way pull forward bookings for the third and fourth quarter just wondering if the big deal pipeline has been impacted now that you've signed these deals? Thanks.","David Rowland","No it\u2019s I'll tell you, I'll just kind of work backwards. We feel good about our pipeline. I mean obviously, when you have a big bookings quarter you convert a lot of pipeline to bookings. That's a factor. But even with that, we feel very good about our pipeline. We actually feel good about recent movement that we've seen in the larger deal category within our pipeline. Tien-Tsin, I would say just in terms of color on the bookings, I don't know if there are really any dominant themes. It crosses the spectrum of operations including BPO type contracts. There's a flavor of application services in there. And I guess stating the obvious, there's a flavor of Digital in there as well. The thing about our bookings that we were especially pleased with and generally this would apply to the 15 clients is the pervasiveness of the strength of the bookings. And I mentioned that we had sequential growth across all five of our operating groups and all three geographic areas. And so I would say that there's not anything unique about the 15. And again, we feel good about our pipeline going forward.","Pierre Nanterme","I mean what I appreciate with our results is they are broad-based and so bookings exactly the same pattern. If you're looking from an operating group standpoint, if you're looking from a geographic standpoint as well, you will see they are extremely well-balanced across the board. So we don't specially benefit this quarter of any outstanding performance of one part of the business compared to the others. It's very well-balanced with of course a lot of Digital across the board and this is the kind of balanced growth we appreciate.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Just hoping to get some color on the breakout of consulting and outsourcing and how to think about those on a constant currency basis in the second half of the year? And then my second question is just on gross margins. I know we're solving for operating margins but on the gross margins they were down 140 basis points, I think it's a little more than usual maybe you can just give us some color on the gross margins? Thanks.","David Rowland","Yes. I would say first on your first question in terms of the second half of the year, I would think in terms of mid to high single-digit positive growth for consulting and let's say probably high single digit positive for outsourcing. So that puts us on a track for the full year of probably mid to high single for consulting again and low double-digit for outsourcing. In terms of the profitability point, at the risk of being redundant, I guess let me just share a few things with you beyond what I said in the script. First of all, we're very pleased with the 30 basis points of expansion. That\u2019s obviously is at the upper-end of the range what we target and it does reflect a lot of the hard work that our organization has been doing over the last four quarters.","What I really focus on when I looked at our profitability are few things. The first thing I focus on is the progression of our contract profitability. And I can tell you that our contract profitability was up compared to the same quarter last year and we continue to be pleased with the progression of contract profitability. The second thing that I look at is the progression of the overall efficiency of our labor cost, both our Accenture personnel and our subcontractors. And we have made really good improvement in our labor cost efficiency for several quarters now and that's in the mix as well when you look at our second quarter results.","The third thing I\u2019ll look at is how our organization is doing in managing every dime we spend as if it's our own individually, related to non-payroll expenses. And we've done a very good job with that. And then finally, although this is certainly not last on the list, at the end of the day we are seeking to create head room in our P&L so that we can invest at sufficient levels to really drive our business growth going forward. And we have a good mix of investments in our results as well. And so we always are talking about in this forum at least we get the questions on the gross margin and the SG&A but those are the things that I really focus on and all of those things were in the right zone relative to my expectations, creating the 30 basis points of expansion.","The last thing I'll say is gross margin again includes a lot of things. It's not just contract profitability. It includes recruiting, training, integration of acquisitions, on-boarding costs for new hires, et cetera. So, there is a lot that goes in there that ebbs and flows quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Koning","And I guess first of all just high level if we think back the last four quarters have been very good and the prior six quarters before that have been kind of low to mid single-digit growth. And I guess I am wondering is this just kind of a natural ebbs and flows of the business that have kind of a nice acceleration after a period of slowdown and really behind the question is can this higher level of growth now that we\u2019ve seen it for a full year kind of stay sustainable or have that kind of been one off of it that allowed revenue to kind of ebb higher that starts to I guess anniversary and starts to slow down a bit just kind of high level just wondering how that plays out overtime?","Pierre Nanterme","And commenting on the, I mean the first part of your question and what happened at this last three quarters compared to what happened before. I guess as you know the world has changed significantly and we have put a lot of thought at Accenture on what it takes to be relevant in this new world and to respond to the current needs of our clients and the needs are much more around how we deal with uncertainty, how we deal with volatility, how we bring more flexible solution, how we provide more productivity and efficiency. And that\u2019s why we come with this and it\u2019s obviously like quite simple but this really vision around at the end of the day it\u2019s all going to be digitization of the business for clients on behalf of our clients and the rationalization of their operations.","And then we significantly align the Accenture strategic agenda and our investments towards these two main trends. And as you know and you\u2019ve seen that recently and we communicated to a lot, we invested in new skills, we invested in new organization with the creation Accenture Consulting, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations. We made several strategic acquisitions specially focusing on digital and operation we\u2019re quite very deep skills, we have more than 1,000 PSD doing algorithm in analytics at Accenture. So this is what we did this last couple of years and I guess that now we are getting the return on the strategy we set and on the investment we\u2019ve made we are absolutely not complaisant with that but to a great extent we have seen the way of pass through to be relevant to our client, we have committed to it and now we are executing seamlessly.","David Rowland","Yes and I would I know that I couldn\u2019t really add anything to that frankly, it's -- I mean you in your question is there anything unusual or like one-time of that nature and the answer is absolutely not and again I think that the thing that you would have to just look at is the broad-based nature of the growth which speaks to the durability and one of the things at Investor Analyst Day David if you remember, is I really talked quite a bit about our growth model and why we believe it is durable overtime and again our enduring objective is to grow faster than the market. Now the market growth rates change overtime and our growth rates will change with it, but our enduring objective is to grow faster than the market and we\u2019re working hard to have durability in our growth model to allow us to do that.","David Koning","And I guess just one short follow-up just this quarter the resources margin was 12.8% it hasn\u2019t been under 15% in about six years and just on that line item specifically if something changed a little bit?","David Rowland","Yes the operating group margins can be lumpy quarter-over-quarter. As you know, we have been working hard to position our resources business for growth and congratulations to our team for doing that. I also called out if you extracted this from the comments I made on resources, the growth in resources right now is coming really exclusively from our outsourcing related services, operations and application services. And so, you see a little bit of mix there as well. But we\u2019re not -- I am not particularly concerned about the profitability in a single quarter. We have good profit potential in resources going forward and overtime we will tune the levers to get it back to the right level.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on some of the transactional short duration business and how those bookings are tracking and more importantly going forward what inning do you think we\u2019re in cyclically in terms of that improvement?","David Rowland","Well, we\u2019ve definitely seen a increasing volume of the smaller short-term type projects and of course that\u2019s reflected in our consulting growth. And I would say that the drivers of that broadly anchor back to the themes Pierre has talked about so often. You look at the digital space and the nature of the digital work is that it really lends itself to this agile quick turn development and deployment of capability. But also on the cost rationalization agenda, that drives a lot of demand for our strategy practice, for our consulting practice like in the past we\u2019ve referred to as management consulting as an example working with our companies to develop a strategic cost map for cost rationalization and then getting into the implementation of that. And we see some of that in shorter smaller projects which are contracted in phases over a period of time. So those are the kinds of things that are in the mix, Pierre may add some additional flavor to that.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes indeed, I think what is interesting to see in the mix of work we are telling is we have at the same time as you know we are quite famous for this large scale transformation program and again this year as mentioned by David we have a few large scale opportunities at times. And at the same time especially with the rise of digital, you have more what I would call higher velocity projects. So I think what we have now in our portfolio of bookings is this large scale transaction which are clearly the kind of unique that will favor Accenture is kind of end-to-end combining all our capabilities to deliver transformation plus the higher velocity programs more digital related services driven and this is this mix which I think has impacted on balance the average duration of our bookings.","David Rowland","Yes, does that help Jim?","Jim Schneider","And then maybe as a follow-up, but just you're doing well on the cost control side with both sales and marketing and G&A dollars down in absolute terms on a year-over-year basis, any color on how much of that is FX versus organic? And then some of the initiatives you're doing to kind of keep those expenses under control?","David Rowland","Yes, I think the -- it's a real cost savings I mean one big area is we\u2019ve talked about for years as you\u2019ll know. But we are always focused on continuing to look for improvements in our sales efficiency and our channel costs and so we have made improvements in that area under the leadership of our COO Jo Deblaere. We also have an ongoing really it\u2019s ongoing transformation agenda for each of our corporate functions. And we very much due to our ourselves I should say we leveraged that the same kind of capabilities that we sell to our clients internally and so we use BPO concepts for example across HR and finance and we have more room to go. It\u2019s an ongoing journey for us just as it is for our clients and we\u2019ve made improvements in our what we call our corporate function cost as well and those are real savings not FX related. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on that going forward. So those are a couple of examples.","Operator","And we do have a question for the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.","David Grossman","So this was the second consecutive quarter that you beat your revenue guidance and you\u2019ve reached the year. Can you help us understand whether that was again relative to your guidance was faster backlog conversion or some of the smaller higher velocity projects that you just mentioned? And again I know you said that strength was broad based-across the geographies and verticals. But I am just wondering again relative to kind of where you started the year whether that\u2019s more relevant to a particular vertical or a particular geography?","David Rowland","Yes it\u2019s interesting because we look quite a bit at where did we come-in better than we expected and not to be too simplistic but the answer is that all five of our operating groups every single one of them came in stronger than what we and they expected when we provided guidance in December. And again I think it gets to -- part of the deal was that when you\u2019re on a revenue ramp it can be a little bit more difficult to predict the slope of the ramp because for example we can be quite confident in the work activity but yet we have to also think about our operating groups too, the availability, to the resources, the timing the projects to get started et cetera. And so at the end of the day all five of our operating groups exceeded so again it was broad-based.","And I would say that it was more in our consulting related services than our outsourcing so consulting came in stronger and part of that again goes back to the digital theme that we talk about as a driver of consulting but also we see more activity across our other consulting type services both strategy and our core consulting business management consulting et cetera. So it\u2019s really consulting came in better and all five operating groups came in better those were really the drivers. And I do think that the higher volume of smaller contracts is in the mix of everything I\u2019ve said really across the board.","David Grossman","And then just secondly I think you mentioned the EPS impact of currency at the end of your prepared remarks. Could you just repeat what the impact your expectation for the EPS impact is for the year?","David Rowland","So what I said specifically is that there were really two factors that we use to adjust the range, one is the higher revenue which we increase revenue and we narrow to a 2 point range so therefore we narrowed the EPS range. And the second factor was the FX, plain and simply those two factors and what I\u2019ve said is that absent the FX headwind which impacted our EPS by 14 pennies so FX impacted by 14 pennies, our revenue would have increased $0.10 to $0.14 absent the impact of -- I am sorry our EPS would have increased $0.10 to $0.14 absent the $0.14 FX headwind.","David Grossman","And does that include the first quarter impact as well or is that just from the second quarter on?","David Rowland","That\u2019s from the second quarter on the revised full year guidance.","David Grossman","Okay, because you had a fairly significant FX impact in the first quarter as well, right?","David Rowland","If you look I mean if you look at where we started the year versus so if you take our initial guidance with where we are now absent the FX headwind we\u2019ve increased our guidance $0.16 to $0.20.","David Grossman","Okay, got it, great.","David Rowland","And then the difference is all FX.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Charlie Brennan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Charlie Brennan","Thanks so I\u2019ve got two questions if that\u2019s possible the first is just on\u2026","David Rowland","I was going to say. We\u2019ll judge whether we give you a second question based on the first. Go ahead.","Charlie Brennan","Okay, I\u2019ll go easy then a couple of the companies that I\u2019ve been speaking to in Europe have been suggesting there is incremental pressure from clients from more favorable DSO terms I was wondering if you can just put that in context with the two day move we\u2019ve seen in this results and maybe can you give us some medium-term expectations of where you would like to see DSOs in two to three years time?","David Rowland","Yes I mean there's no doubt that the environment is tougher on commercial terms and conditions and billing and collections are really right in the mix of that. So we've seen that trend certainly. We had always signaled, by the way that the DSO levels that we've had at some point in the recent years past when they have gotten down in the low 30s, that we had always signaled that, that was likely not sustainable overtime and that our DSOs would creep back up to the mid to even high 30 range. And so that pattern has played out exactly as we had expected and anticipated. So we're very comfortable with where we are. I think that by and large if you look at the last few quarters, our DSO has been relatively stable. It was up a little. Now it's down a couple of days. So we're in the range that we expect to be, in the range that we expect to be let's say for the rest of this year. And it's an area that we are always focused on and have been very good at managing our billing and collections. So I would just say that at least for this year, we're in the range of what we expect.","Charlie Brennan","And if you look out two or three years, does the high 30s feel like the right number or is it the type of situation you are just taking every year as it comes?","David Rowland","I mean it's hard to say, I mean I am not going to look out a few years really, I think what we\u2019ve said again is that we could certainly see DSOs creeping up to the mid to upper 30s and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Togut","Could you update us David on pricing across consulting and outsourcing and in particular perhaps application, maintenance and development where I think you called out perhaps a year and a half ago some increasing pricing pressure, where do you stand today?","David Rowland","I would say overall we\u2019re pleased with the way our pricing has progressed since the same time last year. We saw actually improvement in our pricing in the second quarter, I would be clear though that the environment continues to be a competitive environment, no doubt. But we have seen some progression in pricing in certain parts of our business and overall we were very pleased with the margin quality of the 9.4 bookings. I would say that in application services again to be clear David, when we talk about pricing, we\u2019re talking about the margin percentage on the contracts that we sign and in application services we\u2019ve also seen positive progression in the last six months.","David Togut","When you talk about improved pricing and I think Pierre mentioned good pricing in digital, are you seeing material pricing increases in digital services currently?","David Rowland","I would say that we see differentiated pricing in digital relative to other parts of our business and I think I\u2019d leave at that, unless Pierre you have any\u2026","Pierre Nanterme","Yes no, no I think digital related services as long as you can bring differentiated solutions especially the one we invested a lot around is commanding a better price compared to the rest of the portfolio, I mean this is what it is.","David Rowland","Yes, I mean it's all about in areas where we have a leading capability, leading differentiated capabilities and typically we give good pricing and we are in a very strong position in digital with our offerings, our skills, capabilities et cetera.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins","You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're gaining significant market share, could you talk about where you think that\u2019s coming from?","Pierre Nanterme","I guess we are gaining market share certainly in all the three regions where we are operating. So this is again quite well balanced growth given our strong double-digit growth now for almost four years in a row in the U.S. This is probably a place where we are accelerating our gain and I guess we are probably gaining against clearly the more traditional player of our basket of competitors, I mean you know all of them and you know their results and we are growing par with the best of the peer players in each of the businesses we\u2019re operating in. But so far indeed market share gains are quite broad-based again I mean if you look at the -- we have 10 of our industries out of 19 growing double-digit. So I guess and another four with high single-digit growth. So I guess that we are gaining market share in many of our industries I mentioned in Europe as an illustration that we have double-digit growth in Germany, in the Netherland and again I am sure we are gaining significant market share given the market over there when you grow in double-digit. So it\u2019s quite wide spread in many again double-digit growth in Japan, in Brazil, in Australia, so in all places where we have double-digit growth we are gaining market share technically so we are pleased with that.","Sara Gubins","And then could you give us an update on the estimated contribution of acquisitions to fiscal \u201915 revenue? I think you were talking about, about 1% to 1.5%, contribution? Thanks.","David Rowland","Yes, and really no change from what I said last quarter on that.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso","My question revolves around sort of non-linear growth, headcount 323,000 you're going to add 90 fresh bodies this year. Where do you stand with creating B-pass opportunities and other sort of volume or outcome based contracts? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","We continue working on this to create more bifurcation between headcount and revenues. I think we may continue some good progress even if we or we feel at the beginning of this journey if you will. But I've been recently in India as an illustration visiting our BPO practice and looking at all the innovations we are bringing especially around automation, especially around robotics and especially around cognitive computing. And if you bring these three capabilities all together we have indeed a unique opportunity it's happening as we speak in our operations in India to bring a level of productivity and efficiency in our business process operations where we start seeing this bifurcation between headcount growth and revenue growth and we might expect some acceleration in \u201916 and beyond. So it's still early days regarding the leading edge characteristics of these technologies. But I'm feeling extremely positive and even more important Mike Salvino is leading our Accenture Operations business, is feeling extremely confident that we have the tools and techniques to move to the next level of productivity.","Edward Caso","And my other question is now that you\u2019re seeing improved local currency growth and everything seems to be clicking. Will you dial back your M&A investments that you had stepped up in recent years?","Pierre Nanterme","No.","Edward Caso","Thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","I mean I could elaborate but I think the answer is that. I will elaborate that I mean we will continue to invest to acquire, build and develop differentiated skills and capabilities especially around digital and operations. And we\u2019ve been very successful to do it from now and we will continue with that agenda.","KC McClure","Brad we have time for one more question and Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you. And that last question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","Look I want to just start off quickly on the resources and then follow-up on Europe on resources again I know you said that obviously there was some timing around margins. But really the growth rate just, even though it's only 6%, it's accelerating a pretty big headwind for you guys. Number one, do you see enough bookings or contracts there to actually continue that acceleration despite oil prices and everything we're seeing in the industry so that could become more and more of may be a tailwind? And then secondly on Europe, I just wanted to ask about the offshore labor arbitrage opportunity there. I mean for a while you guys have been a lot more onshore outsourcing orbiting Europe as the -- that was really the way to operate there. We know now there's a lot of real demand there for more offshoring and I know you have the GDN to do so. Just curious what you're seeing on that front. That could be a I think a long, multi-year opportunity.","David Rowland","Yes I\u2019ll comment on resources and maybe let Pierre comment on Europe. On resources we do feel good about how the business has been repositioned for sustained growth now going forward. The bookings have been very good in terms of their book-to-bill on a year-to-date basis and that speaks well to the growth opportunities going forward. I think I have mentioned that when you look at resources that had growth in all three geographic areas and in all of the industries except energy but even in energy we actually had very strong double-digit growth in our outsourcing related services, so operations and application services. And so what we\u2019re finding is that even with the pressures in energy, we really are helping our clients with our application services and operations services as they were from their cost optimization cost rationalization agenda and so we think that we are positioned for sustained positive growth in resources even with the recent challenges in energy.","Darrin Peller","That\u2019s great, thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes and to add the color on this resources recovering many industries, if you take chemical which is a very important industry for us, we\u2019re growing more than 20%. So when you look at it from a portfolio standpoint, from a European standpoint I mean you're absolutely right to mention that the outsourcing market is vibrant again our clients in Europe are looking for more efficiency and more productivity. And if I look at digital versus digitization versus rationalization probably U.S. would be a bit more on digitization, where Europe would be a bit more on rationalization which is offering a good space for the outsourcing work. And again we benefit from the diversity of our global delivery network and we can come with our clients and we\u2019d like to mention that you need to be sometime a little bit more balanced and subtle in the way you're driving outsourcing in Europe.","With respect to the different nationalities labor market and environment and so the mix it's more that the right sourcing and the smart sourcing with the good mix of onshore, offshore and with benefit of Accenture providing a very diverse global delivery and what will of course resources on an offshore standpoint especially in India and the Philippine, but as well a network of near shore centers which is helping us to get to what we believe is the right sourcing approach for our clients. So, I am feeling extremely confident and based on the result of outsourcing business in Europe is doing well.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you to all of you. Thanks a lot for taking the time and participating to our call today. As you\u2019ve seen with half of the fiscal year been it's clear that we have built strong momentum in our business and it's clear as well that we\u2019re gaining significant market share. We are seeing clearly the return on the investments we\u2019ve made, particularly in digital and operations and we will continue to execute our growth strategy to bring innovative and differentiated services to the marketplace. In closing, I want to thank the 323,000 women and men of Accenture for their dedication, their passion and their commitment to delivering value for our clients each and every day in the marketplace.

We hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.","Let me quickly outline the agenda for today\u2019s call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market position before David provides our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2016. We will then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.","As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today\u2019s call, we\u2019re talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues. Some of the matters we\u2019ll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today\u2019s news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this call.","And now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We delivered very strong financial results for the second quarter, and I\u2019m extremely pleased with the momentum we have created in our business over the last eight quarters. This quarter, our growth was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business. Our strategy is clearly resonating with the needs of our clients and differentiating Accenture in the marketplace, but in regards to gain significant market share.","Here are few highlights from the quarter. We delivered outstanding new bookings of $9.5 billion. We grew revenues 12% in local currency, a very strong performance, including double-digit growth in four of our five operating groups and all three geographic regions.","Operating margin was 13.7%, an expansion of 10 basis points. We delivered outstanding earnings per share of $1.34 on an adjusted basis, a 24% increase. We generated free cash flow of $169 million. And we continued to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Today, we announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, which will bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.20 per share or 8% increase over last year.","Now, with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our business and how we\u2019re positioned for the year. Based on our strong performance, we are raising our business outlook for both, revenues and earnings per share for the year.","Now, let me hand over to David. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. And thanks all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our outstanding financial results from the second quarter. Once again, our results this quarter reflect continued strong momentum across almost every dimension of our business, reflecting the strength of our leadership position in the market and the relevance of our offerings and capabilities through our clients.","Before I get into the details, let me summarize some of the important highlights from this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 12% represents the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is even more impressive when you consider that quarter two of last year grew 12% as well. The overriding [ph] theme of broad-based growth was evident again this quarter with four of our operating groups and all three geographic areas posting strong double-digit growth. Our growing leadership position and digital related services continued to serve us well. And combined with cloud related services and security, we continue to be the partner of choice in helping our clients rotate to the new.","Operating margin of 13.7% reflects 10 basis points expansion within our annual guided range. Our profitability continues to reflect the absorption of significant investments in our people and in our business, as we further strengthen our leadership position in the market. The combination of strong revenue growth, expansion in our margin and tax rate efficiencies resulted in 24% EPS growth for the quarter and 11% EPS growth year-to-date, excluding the gain on sale of Navitaire, which I\u2019ll describe in more detail shortly.","Free cash flow of $169 million came in as expected and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver our annual guidance range, which reflects free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest at scale in our business, closing five acquisitions in the quarter with year-to-date invested capital of approximately $750 million. So, we\u2019re very pleased with our results which continue to demonstrate our ability to successfully deliver on our three imperatives for driving shareholder value, durable revenue growth; sustainable margin expansion; and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation.","With that said, let\u2019s now turn to some of the details for the quarter. As expected, we delivered a higher level of new booking this quarter at $9.5 billion including an all-time record high consulting bookings. Consulting bookings were $5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2, outsourcing bookings were $4.5 billion also with the book-to-bill of 1.2 and consistent with our target. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the strong and balanced demand across all of our business dimensions, which is best illustrated by our estimated book-to-bills.","Consulting and strategy had a combined book-to-bill of 1.1; application services, a book-to-bill of 1.2; and operations of book-to-bill of 1.3. And across the board, digital-related services continued to be a significant driver of our new bookings. Finally, we\u2019re pleased that we had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which again points to the strength of our client relationships and their trust and our ability to drive their most important initiatives.","So, turning now to revenue, net revenues for the quarter were $7.95 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 12% in local currency, reflecting a negative 6% foreign exchange impact. Our quarter two revenues were higher than our guided range, primarily due to consulting demand being even stronger than expected across many of our operating groups and geographic markets. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 12% in USD and 18% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 6% in local currency.","Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter, we had strong and balanced estimated growth across all business dimensions. Digital-related services continued to be the dominant theme [ph] with growth above 25%, which once again fueled double-digit growth in our strategy and consulting services, combined. Operations returned to double-digit growth, and we saw an uptick in application services to high-single-digit growth.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, H&PS grew 15% in the quarter with very strong double-digit growth in both health and public service; and overall in North America and the growth markets. Products delivered broad-based growth of 14% and continued to be led by our industrial and life sciences industries which were very -- with very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. Communications, media and technology grew 13% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets, as well as electronics and high-tech and media and entertainment globally.","Financial services momentum continued with 13% growth, led by very strong double-digit growth in banking and capital markets as well as strong growth across all three geographies. And finally, resources delivered 4% growth, led by continued strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe.","We continue to navigate cyclical headwinds in energy and in chemicals and natural resources where growth is significantly challenged. At the same time, looking at resources overall, we feel that we are more than holding our own in a very difficult environment.","Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 29.8% compared to 29.9% in the same period last year. Our sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.7% for the same quarter last year, down 20 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.7%, up 10 basis points from the second quarter last year.","Operating income was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter two last year. In the second quarter, as part of launching an important partnership with Amadeus, we closed our Navitaire transaction which lowered our quarter two tax rate by 1.7%, increased net income by $495 million, and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 26% for the second quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal \u201816, benefited from a final determination of prior-year tax liabilities as well as changes in the geographic distribution of earnings.","Net income on an adjusted basis was $905 million for the second quarter, compared with net income of $743 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.34, compared with EPS of $1.08 in the second quarter last year. This reflects the 24% year-over-year increase of which $0.17 or 16% came from the lower tax rate.","Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding were 39 days compared 41 days last quarter and 35 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $169 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $317 million, net of property and equipment additions of $148 million.","Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at February 29th was $3 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31st.","Turning to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with the global headcount of about 373,000 people, which was roughly flat with quarter one and up 15% compared to quarter two of last year. We now have approximately 273,000 people in our global delivery network. Our utilization in quarter two was 90%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition which excludes involuntary terminations was 13%, consistent with quarter one and down 1% compared to the same period last year.","With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 8.1 million shares for $829 million at an average price of $102.14 per share. At February 29th, we had approximately 6.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","As Pierre just mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.10 per share, representing an 8% over the dividend we paid in May last year. This dividend will be paid on May 13, 2016.","Finally, before I close, let me mention that our Board has approved a decision to terminate our U.S. pension plan, which will reduce future risk and administrative costs to Accenture. This is subject to regulatory approvals and is not expected to be finalized for 12 months to 18 months. Upon final settlement, we expect to record a principally non-cash settlement charge of approximately $350 million.","So, at the halfway point in the fiscal year, we\u2019ve delivered very strong results and feel that we\u2019re well-positioned for remainder of the year. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows, and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.","Now, let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. So, looking at the first half of the fiscal year \u201816, our outstanding results demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy and that we are taking a leadership position in every part of our business. Year-to-date, we have delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, which is well above the market growth rate. We continue to accelerate our rotation to the new, digital, cloud and security related services, which together accounted for nearly 40% of our total revenues in the first half of the year and grew at the strong double-digit rate.","At the same time, we continue to see very strong performance across the rest of our business, which remains extremely competitive and is generating very good growth. Let me bring all of these to life with a few examples, beginning with how we are leveraging our innovative capacities to help clients to our digital transformation.","Working with Boston Scientific, we have jointly developed a cloud-based digital health solution for hospitals, built on the Accenture Insights Platform, the new installation is designed to leverage our analytics capabilities to significantly improve patient care and reduce treatment cost.","Accenture Interactive continues to gain traction in the marketplace and has recently been named the digital agency partner for Celebrity Cruises where we are helping redesign the digital customer experience and for L\u2019Or\u00e9al in Brazil, where we are responsible for search engine optimization and digital marketing analytics.","In Accenture Mobility, we are using the Accenture connected platform to drive digital transformation for Metro de Madrid, one of the largest transportation systems in the world. We expect to increase operating efficiency, improve the passenger experience, and enable new Internet of Things based services.","We continue to operate at the heart of our clients\u2019 businesses with strong demand for our core capabilities. And given our industry expertise and end-to-end capability, we remain the partner of choice for the world\u2019s leading companies.","\\","In the U.S., Accenture Strategy is helping FirstEnergy improve competitiveness and operational agility with the cash flow improvement program that is expected to deliver more than $450 million in savings over three years.","We are working with a leading food company to transform its global operating model; an integrated team from Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and Accenture Operations each providing process redesign as well as finance and accounting and HR business process services.","We continue to invest across our business to further enhance our capabilities and differentiation in the marketplace including making nine acquisitions in the first half of the year. In particular, we have made significant investment to strengthen our industry expertise in several key sectors.","In health, we acquired Sagacious Consultants, a leading provider, implementing electronic health record systems in the U.S. In financial services, we acquired Beacon Consulting, based in Boston, to expand our capabilities in asset management, and we acquired Formicary, a leading provider of systems integration and technology consulting for trading platforms in the UK, U.S. and Canada.","Also in financial services, we created a specialized practice for blockchain technology, which is expected to drive significant efficiency gains or financial institutions. To accelerate our speed to market, we invested in Digital Asset Holdings, a leading developer of blockchain technologies.","And in resources, we acquired Schlumberger Business Consulting, the international management consulting arm of Schlumberger. And in North, we acquired Cimation to expand our consulting digital and cyber security services for industrial asset management.","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, I am very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are driving across all three of our geographic regions. And I am delighted that we delivered double-digit growth for the quarter in many of our largest markets including six, which together comprise 70% of our total revenues.","In North America, we delivered 12% revenue growth, driven by another excellent quarter of strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we delivered exceptional results, with 14% growth in local currency. We deliver double-digit growth in the UK, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Germany, as well as high-single-digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we delivered 10% revenue growth in local currency, led once again by strong double-digit growth in Japan, but we also generated double-digit growth in China and in India, as well as solid growth in Brazil, despite a very challenging environment.","Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on what it means to run Accenture, as a high performance business. It is imperative that we attract, develop and inspire the very best talent in our industry. And I am proud that for eight years in a row, Accenture has been named one of the fortune best Company to work for in the U.S. I am equally proud that in India, Accenture was ranked the top company in our sector on Business Today\u2019s list of the best companies to work for.","In our business, trust is everything. And I couldn\u2019t be more pleased that for the ninth year in a row, Accenture was recognized on Ethisphere list of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies. This is strong recognition of our commitment to ethical leadership and corporate social responsibilities. So, as you can see, every day, we\u2019re making Accenture an even better business partner for all of our stakeholders. We have very strong momentum in our business. And we continue to deliver value in the marketplace.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal \u201816, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 2.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal \u201815 and reflects an estimated 7% to 10% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year \u201816, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollar will be negative 5% compared to fiscal \u201815.","For the full fiscal \u201816, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal \u201815. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year \u201816 to be 14.6% to 14.7%, a 10 to 20 basis-point expansion over adjusted fiscal \u201815 results. As I mentioned earlier, we closed our Navitaire transaction in the second quarter, which will lower the full year FY16 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal \u201816 excludes the impact of this transaction.","We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For adjusted earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal to be in the range of $5.21 to $5.32 or 8% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal \u201815 results.","Now, turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal \u201816, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.","Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s open it up to questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Greg, would you provide instructions for those in the call please?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Obviously good quarter; I just wanted to dig in on the upside [ph] given the strong book-to-bill, we\u2019ve had revenue $200 million above guidance, and usually a pretty tricky quarter. It doesn\u2019t sound like its large deal oriented either. So, I\u2019m curious, do you have resources to meet this demand, especially given the strength in consulting? I\u2019m asking because I want to gauge your confidence in executing against this momentum within your margin targets. So, I\u2019ll start with that question.","David Rowland","Thanks. So, let\u2019s just kind of start it and work through the points that you made. We did have an even stronger quarter than we had expected, no doubt. As you alluded to, in the mix of the fact that the second quarter can be a more difficult quarter to predict, which you know that well, as you know our business well. And the reasons are that you have the holiday period in there including the New Year period which sometimes can be a little unpredictable in terms of how that impacts our available work days, if you will. And then of course you have the turn to the new fiscal year, which can also create sometimes, temporary changes in buying patterns during that first month or two of the new calendar year. In our case, neither of those things had an impact on us.","And to the contrary, the momentum that we\u2019ve had now for many quarters, continued and even built further. And we saw that the upside relative to what we had expected was in our consulting and strategy services combined or our consulting type of work where we had expected double-digit growth but it came in even stronger than we had expected. And Tien-tsin, we\u2019re very pleased that we were able to support that growth with essentially flat headcount versus quarter one, which we view as a very positive thing. And so, as it relates to capacity, we certainly have a supply plan that supports the revenue growth that we\u2019ve projected for the third quarter and the full year. We feel very good about our supply management, and our ability to access talent in the marketplace is as good as it\u2019s ever been.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay, great. And just my quick follow-up, just like I asked last quarter, inorganic contribution to revenue and maybe margin, and if you can, David, give it to us across consulting and outsourcing? Thank you.","David Rowland","Right. So, the inorganic contribution continues to be in the range of about 2%. And as I mentioned last quarter, if you look at it by type of work, it is bigger in consulting than it is in outsourcing and consulting last quarter, I said that it was about 4%. And so, we continued in the second quarter where it was more consulting oriented than outsourcing oriented. Your margin question Tien-tsin was, what now?","Tien-tsin Huang","Just same question related to impact to operating margins from the acquisitions, given the cost side of it.","David Rowland","Well, I would tell you that maybe if I just answered it even in a broader way, I mean the acquisitions are an important part of our investments, but they are not the only part of our investments. Our strategy is to expand our underlying margin at a much higher level than the 10 basis points we reported. And then, we use that headroom to then fund what are higher levels of investments in our business, which includes the impact of acquisitions. So, let me just say that our underlying margin expansion was stronger than the 10 basis points, because our investments continue to grow at a rate faster than revenue and that includes acquisitions among other things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Brian Essex","I was wondering if you could ask a little bit more about consulting versus outsourcing mix. And I guess what I\u2019m referring to is, if you listen to vendors like Salesforce.com on their call and they talk about system integrators becoming ISVs and then we hear Accenture talk about shifting deals towards more outcome-based pricing. Is there a way to think about the changes in bookings and revenue between outsourcing and consulting, particularly as we see the acceleration in consulting going forward?","David Rowland","Well, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and Pierre may add as well. What I would say is that, I mean the basic answer to your question is no in the sense that what we viewed as consulting is unchanged and obviously likewise the same is true for outsourcing. What we see in consulting is, probably a couple of things. One thing we see is that -- in fact, I guess, I would say it this way. At the foundation of what\u2019s driving our consulting revenue growth is the depth of our industry expertise and the fact that we really operate, not only at the heart of our clients, but at the heart of our industries in terms of being on top of the most important trends and being able to help our clients respond to those trends. And that draws in a lot of our consulting type services. So, if you look at Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, you look at Accenture Digital, that brings us right into the heart of the clients\u2019 high priority agenda, because it\u2019s all grounded fundamentally in industry expertise.","The second thing that is driving our consulting growth is the fact that we are establishing ourselves as among the leaders if not the leader in the rotation to the new. [Ph] And when you look at consulting, it reflects it includes by the way systems integration services, which are included on our consulting type of work and our dimension reporting that reflected in app services. But we have a lot of systems integration work over recent quarters associated with clients that are investing in and deploying new technology. And so, maybe I\u2019d just stop there. But our consulting growth is really driven by the things that we\u2019ve been highlighting which are the priority areas that we\u2019re focused on in our growth strategy.","Brian Essex","Maybe if I could follow-up on the digital growth, it seems as that you\u2019re indicating a nice reacceleration in growth there. Anything we can think about in terms of what\u2019s causing some of the variability in year-over-year growth rates that we\u2019ve seen, particularly after a slight deceleration last quarter and then obviously reaccelerating this quarter? Is it still choppy growth off of lower numbers or is there something else maybe seasonal at play there?","David Rowland","I wouldn\u2019t read anything into, I mean, I guess what I would focus on is that in both quarters, the growth was north of 20% and the north of 25%. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. I mean, our digital growth is going to continue to be consistently strong double-digit. And within the context of strong double-digit, you might have some fluctuation, but overall, the growth is outstanding, and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with not only digital, but also the new, when you look at the growth that we have in cloud related services and security.","Pierre Nanterme","This is absolutely right. And this is the reason why in my part reporting to you around the business update, I covered Q1 and Q2. I mean, all our business is not driven by quarterly activities. We are selling operating overall cycle, which is the case for these digital related services. So, there is no point you should over-read the kind of quarterly results and much more pulling these results in the context of a much longer term. This is what we mentioned that we have for our seven -- six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. When you look our digital rotation, count has been double-digit growth for several quarters as well. So, what we are pleased with is the consistency and the duration of our growth in digital and overall Accenture, and not so much quarterly situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So, obviously very strong demand metric is expected; so, congratulations on that. My question is the higher level of revenues and EPS is not driving a corresponding rise in cash flow. Why is that?","David Rowland","Well, I mean there -- as we said before, there are a lot of things that impact our cash flow in a particular year. We have had a couple of day uptick in DSO; that impacts the timing of tax cash payments as an example from year-to-year, can impact the cash flow. Ashwin, what I really focus on is that our cash flow and the range that we provided, our free cash flow continues to be at a level that is greater than net income. And if you remember back to what I\u2019ve started saying three years ago, what I\u2019ve really focused on is the durability of our business model and generating cash flow in excess of net income. And this year continues that trend. And that\u2019s the mark of a -- that\u2019s a very distinctive mark for a very successful cash flow generating business. And so, we\u2019re very pleased with the cash flow. And also, remember that the range that we gave is $300 million, and so it\u2019s a fairly broad range. When you think about the fact we\u2019ve change revenue, we didn\u2019t change cash flow; it is a broad range. But it\u2019s in excess to net income and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on driving.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So, the second question really is you had relative to the very strong consulting, a weaker level of outsourcing throughout the last few quarters. You\u2019re not alone in this trend; several other companies are in the same boat. I wanted to ask how much of that weaker outsourcing planned in relative terms; is volume versus pricing versus productivity gains because of higher levels of automation, things like that?","David Rowland","Yes. We don\u2019t -- we\u2019ve not quantified it in those three buckets. I mean it\u2019s a very smart question to ask. We just haven\u2019t quantified it in those three buckets. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to do it on the call, even if I had the numbers in front of me, which I don\u2019t. But I would tell you, may be sorry to say the obvious, but all three of those things are in the mix, no doubt about it. I mean, we are very pleased with progress that we\u2019re making on the automation front in both the app services and BPO as well. There is no doubt that in the application maintenance piece of application services that there is -- that is a highly competitive environment, which does impact the revenue yield per labor hour in that marketplace. But yes, it\u2019s also important to note Ashwin that if you look at pricing as we define it, which is the margin on the work that we\u2019re selling, our margin in that AO businesses is -- I\u2019m talking about pricing, is holding up quite well.","So, we\u2019re managing the trajectory and revenue per head; we\u2019re managing our cost to serve in alignment or actually better than alignment with that trend. And then, we\u2019ve also mentioned that in the market that we\u2019re in now, clients are somewhat universally trying to be more efficient in the cost of ownership of their existing application footprint. And why, they want to do that so that they can invest more in the new. And so, we\u2019re seeing the benefit of that investment in our systems integration business, which is part of our consulting type of work growth; it\u2019s also part of the application services growth, which I mentioned was high-single-digit. So, all three of those things are in the mix and we\u2019re navigating them all.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane ","Health and banking, and capital markets are sectors that some peers have called out some weakness, doesn\u2019t look like Accenture seeing that same weakness. So, I guess my question is where is or why is Accenture seeing strength in banking and capital markets and health, and what\u2019s the outlook there going forward?","Pierre Nanterme","When you look at our different industries, we have -- just to set the scene; we have now 13 industry groupings. We are reporting against the [indiscernible]. And I\u2019m pleased to report that 9 out of the 13 enjoy double-digit growth. And so, it\u2019s quite true across the board. So, what\u2019s explaining in the Russian world is the same for health and for banking and capital market. The growth of our business, the growth of our countries and the growth of our industries is directly linked to the speed of the rotation to the new. It is as simple as this. And fact of the matter is that we invested in those digital related services quite ahead of the curve, certainly at the right time; we\u2019ve been lucky enough to execute this strategy at the right time.","And now, all our industries including banking and capital markets do benefit from this, what I shown to the new, again digital-related services plus cloud-related services plus security-related services. And so when I look at banking and capital markets, a lot of what we do is around the new. And I guess, if some of our competitors have lower growth, for me, this is certainly the signal that their business is still too much associated to the kind of current core activities, let\u2019s call them classic activities, which might be under pressure. And their rotation to the new is certainly slower than what we are experiencing at Accenture.","Bryan Keane","And then just as a follow-up looking at the new guidance for fiscal year \u201816, I saw the raise in constant current revenue growth. But I think the operating margin, which decreased about 10 basis points on the high end, just curious on the reason for the change in operating margin guidance. Thanks, congrats by the way.","David Rowland","So, first of all, our strategic objective is to land the fiscal year within that 10 to 30, and so that is what we\u2019re focused on and we balance multiple objectives in any given year within that target range. So, this year, if you look at where we are on a year-to-date basis and when we reflect, not only on the investments that we\u2019ve made year-to-date in our people and our business, and we reflect on the investments that we want to continue to make in our people and our business during the second half of the year, which are clearly in the best long-term interest of our shareholders and investors. The right balance between what we deliver and reported margin expansion this fiscal year and what we need to do to invest in our business and people is 10 to 20 basis points this year. And so, it\u2019s within that target range that we have and it just reflects the balance that we\u2019re making between delivering margin expansion but at the same time continuing the very successful track record that we\u2019ve had of investing in our business and positioning those investments for future year returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darren Peller","I just want to start off with the inorganic growth for a moment. I mean obviously a number of deals have been coming on. And I think you said 2% was the contribution, which is similar to what you said at your IA day. So that\u2019s consistent. I wonder if -- how much of these deals are really being dedicated towards this digital initiative that you\u2019ve really been able to expand so well. And I guess bigger question is, going forward how much more do we need to keep doing on that front to enable Accenture to stay ahead of the curve on digital or is inorganic going to become 3% or 4% of your growth rate in the next couple of years, as in order to really maintain differentiation, if you could just help us with that?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. On this question, if you look, and I think we reported that recently that on all, if you take fiscal year of \u201815 acquisitions, 70% of the 38 acquisitions we made was digital related and the one which are not 100% digital related been more around deep industry expertise, and I\u2019ve been highlighting a few. And some we are making from an industry standpoint would cover both topics. But let\u2019s say, it\u2019s a strong 70% growth and the other 30% will be more reinforcing our industry with niche acquisition with extremely deep experts. So far, our planning is to continue with the trajectory we set and we communicated to in the IA day in a way which is very consistent in the range of deploying 20% to 30% of our free cash flow. The 900 to 1 billion this year which is roughly 900 two 1 billionish in terms of cash flow being deployed in our acquisition that would typically in our model account for 2% contribution to our growth. This is still our mindset. Now, if we have the opportunity to flex because there are great opportunities in front us, we will remain flexible.","Darren Peller","Well, I just wanted to figure out if these deals are part of the impact from the free cash conversion we\u2019re seeing. I mean you said still within the range but I guess that\u2019s really what we\u2019re getting some questions on is this as much as that definitely enable to drive you to differentiate yourself and grow well better than most of the industry; there is some people asking about financial allocations on the rest of the model. Maybe Dave, if you could just -- I think Tien-tsin, there is a little bit of a follow-up to that question also.","David Rowland","Well, again if you -- I would focus -- by the way, it\u2019s not an inorganic -- I don\u2019t really want to say issue because it\u2019s not an issue. The inorganic is not driving a notable impact on our cash generation. Again very simply, I would point to two things, number one is, is that although we continue to have exceptional DSOs, they have ticked up. And so, a day or two of DSO has an impact on our cash flow. And the second thing is just the timing of large tax cash payments as an example which can fluctuate. But if you look structurally at our cash flow model and what drives our cash, really fundamentally nothing strange.","Darren Peller","All right, that\u2019s helpful. Just last follow-up on the resources side, I mean it\u2019s been pretty impressive to us that you\u2019ve been able to maintain growth at all in that area just given the macro backdrop across resources. And so, I mean in terms of trajectory, I know 4%, it\u2019s lower than the rest of the business. But again for us, seeing growth at all was pretty impressive. Should we expect to see that vertical continue?","Pierre Nanterme","When you talk about resources, there are really two stories in resources. We covering three industry segments, of course two of the industry segments are impacted with the overall natural resources and commodity pricing downturn. And the other one the energy and what we are calling CNR or natural resources and then you have utilities. I mean utilities, it is one of our fastest growing industries, above 20% growth for it.","Darren Peller","Okay.","Pierre Nanterme","Just to set the scene publicly, because it\u2019s explaining, although I can see your question, you\u2019re positive with two industries, what explaining that is our resources leadership; we don\u2019t get at the same time in two rotations, if you will, to put it very simply, now rotating to higher growth and higher potential industries and today it is from energy to utilities and then rotating this industry to the new. And if you look at the utility, it is at the same time the 20 plus percent growth is significantly fueled by the rotation to the new.","Darren Peller","Okay.","Pierre Nanterme","I\u2019m pleased to mention that because sometime we believe the rotation to the new is more for the business to consumer kind of industries and banking, the insurance come, the retail consumer goods and so forth. But at Accenture, the rotation to the new is big even in the B2B business. And what we\u2019ve been doing in utilities especially providing superior services in terms of IoT, in terms of grid management and bringing the digital at the heart of the utilities operation, each creating super normal [ph] growth for utility balancing the downside. And this is an opportunity to share with you that\u2019s why we like so much our diverse portfolio of business and diverse portfolio of industries, which is for us absolutely critical in our ability to continue delivering sustainable and predictable profitable growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Perlin","Just a couple of questions real quick on the consulting growth, it clearly continues to be impressive. I\u2019m just wondering, to what extent, if there is any that you feel like you\u2019re benefiting from some of the global M&A, not so much M&A you\u2019ve done, but what companies you\u2019re doing who represent your clients. You mentioned system integration work and investments in new technology. But I\u2019m wondering if there is a lot of integration that\u2019s going on as a result of some of this other global M&A.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. And the answer is yes. I guess indeed, we had the opportunity to talk about it. But for the last couple of years, we said that you had two massive growth drivers in the marketplace at the high level, one is the digitalization of the industries, which is huge, massive coverage everywhere. And coming together with what we\u2019re calling the rationalization of the operations, and the rationalization of the portion. This is what\u2019s driving good growth in the rest of the business and non-digital specific business in application outsourcing, in application services, in business process outsourcing and that kind of services. You\u2019re right that these last six months or six, seven months, we\u2019ve seen a third engine kicking in which I will call consolidation, what you\u2019re calling M&A. So, we are digitalization, rationalization and indeed we are adding consolidations. And we are, given a very good position with Accenture Consulting, operating at the heart of our clients\u2019 businesses and quite connected to the C-Suite. We are a partner of choice in some of the major consolidation ongoing, on the planet. So, we have the third engine kicking in.","Dan Perlin","That\u2019s fantastic. And my follow-up, in the past, you\u2019ve I think sized or given us a little bit more details around what, how big now, at this point in the business you have digital and you have cloud and you have security, and think like you said somewhere around 7 billion or something to that effect relative to the legacy ERP, which is the constant question we get. And so, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re willing to update us on that. And if you are, are you just at a point now in that kind of cycle where that digital agenda is as so much bigger that it\u2019s worth this legacy tail which you\u2019ve had for the year? Thank you.","David Rowland","Well, I think Pierre might have had in his script that if you look at the new, digital cloud and security, that is approaching 40% of our revenue. So, you can just do math off our revenue to get the dollars. On the ERP, the ERP business continues to be under 20% of our total revenue. Now, we\u2019ll say that we have seen some growth in the ERP space. And so, we have always expected that -- I mean ERP is fundamentally the back -- the technology backbone for all companies, manage their business. We never felt like the ERP business was going to go away. We always have anticipated a cycle where there would be investment in next generation ERP, and we\u2019re part of helping our clients move to next generation ERP. And so, we are seeing some growth in ERP, and we\u2019re very pleased with our ERP business.","Pierre Nanterme","And maybe I think we\u2019re using or I am using this term a lot that it\u2019s all about the rotation of the business, as we speak. And I believe that the main difference between the winners and the losers is coming from the one who are able to rotate to the high growth areas and to rotate at speed. When you look at the ERP, as David just said, all our strategy, I think the down cycle was to start building capabilities to rotate our ERP to new ERPs and at the time we were calling as an illustration building capabilities, strong capabilities with HANA, which is going to be the next generation and as for the next generation of ERP with SAP. I am taking that as an illustration. And guess what, as we speak, given the investments we made ahead of this HANA S\/4 wave, today we are already the number one in implementing S\/4 and HANA in the world. We see clearly and you see improving with the results of SAP, a pick up on this new ERP development.","And if you move beyond the strict definition of ERP to the broader definition of application packages, then it\u2019s even more spectacular in terms of Accenture positioning. We are enjoying good growth in all the application package and especially with the new stat packages. And I am very pleased with the growth that I am showing with Salesforce; I am very pleased with the growth we have with Workday, with Microsoft Dynamics and some other application package services. So, we benefit from having rotating our ERP to the next generation of ERP and plus having taken a leadership position in this new application package. So, all in all this business is growing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","First, David, one quick follow-up question on the operating margin outlook for the year, you mentioned you\u2019ve changed your investments, I guess for the rest of the year and as a result, made a different trade off there. Can you just give some examples of what some of those investment areas are that you decided to accelerate for this year?","David Rowland","I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as so much of a change. I mean, remember, 10 basis points off the top is $30 million. And so, it\u2019s really, we are executing very well, Lisa, against the investment plan that we really started the year with. And on the inorganic front, we are certainly well-positioned to spend probably at the upper end of that range, 900 to 1 billion; so, we would be closer to 1 billion. We continue to invest in our assets and offerings and our people, et cetera. And so, I wouldn\u2019t say that there is -- that we have set a new trajectory. It\u2019s just that you look at the aggregation of our results; you look at where we are year-to-date; you look at our planned investment spending for the second half of the year, which is not materially different from where we started, we just think that the more likely landing zone is in that 10 basis points to 20 basis points. But, the point Lisa that I would reinforce is that it would be incorrect to interpret that as what\u2019s a shift in the underlying economics of our business because underneath that we\u2019re driving much more headroom in our P&L. So, our ability to drive profit improvement in our underlying business is alive and well; it\u2019s just that this year the level of investments and the other factors will put us more in that 10 to 20 basis-point range.","Lisa Ellis","And then a follow-up on the macroeconomic side, given the global and sector diversity in your business, can you just give an idea of where, now three months into the year, where you\u2019re seeing overall IT budget settle out? And then also, how much of the digital and the new work is being funded out of IT versus out of other parts of your clients budgets, like outside the IT budgets?","Pierre Nanterme","When I look to the market, to be honest, I do not see much changes, as we speak. And just to be more specific, I think I always said, it was in October that the overall economic environment is sluggish, to say the least, and it is still sluggish. So, we can\u2019t expect much regarding the environment; it\u2019s unstable, risky, extraordinary complex. That was the case last year; it\u2019s still the case this year. When I am looking at the budget from our plans, I am not seeing any significant change.","Again, it\u2019s this story around the three drivers now. Digitalization, all industries are investing in digitizing their operations, because all the leaders and all these industries are subject to disruption, and to massive disruption. So that\u2019s what the new factor in turn. It\u2019s not about being better, it\u2019s not about getting more productivity, it\u2019s about not being disrupted and not being disrupted with not disappearing in the marketplace. This is the right, so I\u2019d say this cycle is here for quite a while and they have to invest.","Now, where the money is coming from is for rationalization of the operations. I mean calls for engineering, IT efficiency, it\u2019s all of this, and it\u2019s across the board in many organizations. It\u2019s coming from IT, but as well it\u2019s coming from all the business lines, looking at rationalization, which of course is driving good business for our Accenture Strategy or Accenture Consulting practices to do business process for engineering and profit improvements. We had a rise of what we call [indiscernible] and the work we\u2019ve been doing, one is very public with Mondelez, which now is representing probably the benchmark of how you transform the cost of realization. [Ph] And if you look at more efficiency, you have a good consolidation. And you see some ways of consolidation especially in resources, especially in chemical; of course the Dow DuPont is the perfect illustration of the kind of consolidation that\u2019s happening. And I can mention a few as well in the telecom, given the need to get to superior level of productivity. So, we\u2019d say the environment is for a small as the same along these three drivers and in an economic context, which is non-inspiring.","KC McClure","Greg, we have time for one more rather quick question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Edward Caso","My first question is around Navitaire. What kind of contribution did that provide revenue margin and EPS before? And I assume this is in cash flow to the Company over and above that $4 billion number, and I know you\u2019re planning anything special for that?","David Rowland","Yes. So, we have not disclosed previously, and so I don\u2019t think we would do it now in terms of the economics -- the full economics of Navitaire, as we owned it. I think from a revenue standpoint, we did give the size -- or we did not give the size. So Ed, we\u2019ve not commented on that, so I\u2019m not going to do that now. In terms of the proceeds from Navitaire, we just put that in the mix and it\u2019s in the mix of our capital allocation plan. And we look at that in the mix and then execute our capital allocation strategy against our total cash of which Navitaire is now a piece of that. But, we don\u2019t think about carving that out and saying now how are we going to use this piece outside of our normal capital allocation strategy.","Edward Caso","Just to be clear though, the free cash flow guidance does not include the $600 million. And then the follow-on question is your balance cash levels have gone steadily down over the last few years. Is there some minimum level of cash that you\u2019re targeting?","David Rowland","Yes. So, we are very comfortable against what we view our minimum level of cash to be. And so, we are not concerned at all about our cash balance and in any way don\u2019t think that we are touching or have any issues in terms of the minimum cash that we need to run the business. Navitaire is in our free cash guidance, so it is part of the mix. But, we\u2019re very pleased with our cash position. I mean we anticipated that it would -- it\u2019s progressing exactly as we anticipated. And we think by the end of the year, we\u2019ll be -- our cash balance will be pretty close to where we started. So, we\u2019re in a very strong cash position. And of course we have a lot of opportunities for other sources of capital, should we ever decide that we need to do so.","Edward Caso","Okay. Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","All right. It\u2019s time to wrap you. And thanks again for joining us on today\u2019s call. Just saying few words in closing and especially when I see the momentum we have created in our business, when I see our rotation to the new and our gains in market share combined with our continued investment to build a more differentiated Accenture Company, I feel very confident in our ability to deliver against our revised business outlook for fiscal year \u201816 and importantly to continue delivering value for our clients, for our people and for our shareholders. So, we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC.

Later there will be an opportunity for your question and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Ms. KC McClure. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Tom. And thanks everyone for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings announcement. As Tom just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will then take you through the financial details including income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter.","Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. David will then provide our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2014. And then we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call we're talking about revenues before reimbursement or net revenues.","Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking including the business outlook. You should keep in mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and that such statements are not a guarantee of our future performance.","Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed on the risk factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year our results included benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. Federal tax liabilities and a reduction in reorganization liabilities.","We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC. And thanks everyone for joining us today. Our results for the second quarter were pretty much in line with our expectations. We achieved record new bookings, delivered revenues within our guided range and grew earnings per share while continuing to return substantial cash to our shareholders.","Here are a few highlights. We delivered outstanding new bookings of more than $10 billion, including record consulting bookings of $4.6 billion and record outsourcing bookings of $5.5 billion.","We generated revenues of $7.1 billion, a 3% increase in local currency and above the midpoint of our guided range. Earnings per share were $1.03, compared to $1 on an adjusted basis in the second quarter last year. Operating margin was 13.3%, which is flat compared to the second quarter last year on an adjusted basis.","Our balance sheet remains very strong ending the quarter with a cash balance of $3.7 billion. And we continued to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Today, we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $0.93 per share which will bring total dividend payments for the year to $1.86 per share, a 15% increase over last year.","So, overall, we're pleased with our results for the first half of fiscal year 2014 and are encouraged by our very strong bookings of nearly $19 billion year-to-date, which position us well for the second half.","We have updated our business outlook for the full fiscal year and David will cover it later in the call. Over to you, David.","Dave P. Rowland","Thanks, Pierre. And as always, it's great to have the opportunity to talk with you about our financial results and how we're positioned for the full year.","Before I get into the detailed results for the quarter, let me start by providing a few overall highlights. Our second quarter results reflected some clear areas of strength, but also some areas where we expect to perform better in the second half of the year.","The bright spot was clearly in our new bookings where we posted $10.1 billion, setting new records in several areas of our business and providing further indication of how our differentiated capabilities are resonating with the market.","Net revenues landed in the general zone that we expected, with 3% local currency growth, slightly above the midpoint of our guided range.","On the profitability front, our operating margin for quarter two was flat with last year, resulting in 20 basis points of expansion for the first half of the year, solidly in our annual guidance range, but does reflect pricing and cost pressures in certain areas of our business which we're working hard to address.","At the same time, we continued to invest at higher levels in our business and return a significant portion of our cash to our shareholders. So, all in all, quarter two was a solid quarter.","With that, let's get to the numbers, starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were extremely strong at $10.1 billion, representing an all-time high. Consulting bookings were $4.6 billion, with a book-to-bill of $1.2 billion. Outsourcing bookings were $5.5 billion, with a book-to-bill of $1.6 billion.","Looking further at our new bookings, there are several additional insights worth noting. Consulting new bookings were the highest quarter on record, building on our strong consulting bookings performance in quarter one. We saw good demand in both systems integration and management consulting, with both posting book-to-bills above the upper end of our target range.","Outsourcing bookings were also at an all-time high, driven by extremely strong record bookings in BPO, where the demand environment remains robust and where we saw particularly high demand for our finance and accounting offerings.","Technology outsourcing bookings were a little lighter this quarter; following strong bookings performance in quarter one.","From an operating group perspective, CMT and Financial Services were the primary drivers to our strong bookings performance, which further strengthens their position for higher growth in the second half of the year.","And finally, our results include 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, as we continue to be the business partner of choice for helping our clients tackle their largest, most complex projects.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.13 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency, reflecting a negative 1.5% FX impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in December.","Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.7 billion, down 1% in U.S. dollars and flat in low local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.4 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency.","Let me give you some highlights from the operating groups this quarter. Financial Services grew 5% in local currency with broad based double-digit growth in capital markets as well as continued strength in outsourcing overall.","We're very pleased with growth rates in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific, and continue to be focused on driving improved growth rates in North America.","Once again, our Products operating group delivered a very consistent level of growth, well above the Accenture average growth rate, at 5% growth in quarter two. The revenue drivers were similar to last quarter, meaning we continued to see broad based growth with positive growth in both consulting and outsourcing in all three geographic areas and in the majority of our industry segments.","CMT returned to growth at 2% this quarter and we continue to see signs of positive momentum driven by demand for transformation-led value-driven projects. Our efforts to focus the business on new growth areas continue and we're seeing the impact in strong consulting growth across all of our geographic regions. The Americas region continues to be the primary driver of growth, especially in electronics and high tech.","H&PS growth for the quarter was 1%. And while we did signal some moderation in growth from quarter one, growth in the quarter was a little lower than we expected. Our Health business continued to have strong growth, particularly in the Americas. Our Public Service business had a modest decline in the quarter as the environment in Europe continues to be challenging.","Looking ahead, we expect a ramp-up in H&PS growth in the second half of the year, beginning with a significant uptick in quarter three.","Resources growth was flat in quarter two. The energy business continues to be the real bright spot globally with double-digit growth. But cyclical challenges in natural resources continue to negatively impact the overall growth rate of our Resources business. Having said that, we do still expect to have positive growth for the year.","Before moving down the income statement, let me provide some overall context on the factors impacting our profitability this quarter.","Specifically, our operating results for the quarter reflect lower contract profitability, primarily driven by pricing pressures and our challenge in absorbing higher payroll cost and to a lesser extent, lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts.","At the same time, our results also reflect a higher level of investment in the quarter to build new capabilities, including strategic acquisitions aimed at enhancing our capabilities in key growth areas.","And while we have accrued a significant amount of variable compensation this year, we did accrue a lower amount in quarter two compared to the second quarter last year, which offset the factors previously mentioned.","This lower variable compensation expense reduced accrued payroll in the balance sheet and is the primary driver for the reduction in our free cash flow guidance for the year, which I'll cover later.","To be clear, our profitability does vary quarter-to-quarter and it's normal for us to have certain periods where we have areas of cost pressure which require intervention. And as always, we understand the areas that need attention and we're taking action at speed and with the rigor and discipline that our investors have come to expect.","Now to the numbers. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared with 31.6% for the same period last year, down approximately 30 basis points.","Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.7% of net revenues compared with 11.8% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down about 10 basis points.","General and administrative expense was 6.2% of net revenues compared with 6.5% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down approximately 30 basis points.","As a reminder, we had two unusual items that impacted certain metrics in quarter two of last year. The following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results.","Operating incomes was $951 million in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.3% operating margin, equal to the adjusted operating margin for the same period last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared with an adjusted tax rate of 24.8% for the second quarter last year.","Net income was $722 million for the second quarter compared with adjusted net income of $720 million for the same quarter last year.","Diluted earnings per share were $1.03, compared with adjusted EPS of $1 in the second quarter last year, an increase of $0.03.","Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continued to be industry leading. They were 33 days, down slightly from 34 days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $216 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $292 million, net of property and equipment additions of $76 million.","Cash flows for the quarter and year-to-date have also been impacted by lower accrued variable compensation expense, which I previously noted.","Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at February 28 was $3.7 billion compared to $5.6 billion at August 31 last year. The current levels reflects the cash returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends as well as the higher level of acquisitions we've made in the first half of this year.","Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 289,000 people and we now have approximately 192,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter two, our utilization was 87%, consistent with last quarter and slightly down from quarter two last year.","Attrition which excludes involuntary terminations was 12%, up approximately 1% from both quarter one in the same period last year. And lastly, we continue to expect that at least 60,000 people will join our company in fiscal 2014.","Turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 9.2 million shares for $739 million at an average price of $80.40 per share.","Year-to-date, we have purchased 18.9 million shares for approximately $1.5 billion at an average price of $77.25 per share. At February 28, we had approximately $5.8 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","As Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.93 per share, representing a 15% increase over the dividend we paid in May last year and this dividend will be paid on May 15th, 2014.","So, in summary, with the first half of the year behind us, we're generally where we expected to be at this point in time. We see definite signs of building momentum in the market and in many areas of our business, yet the environment continues to be challenging and we're focused on what we need to do to deliver the year.","Our focus, as always, is to leverage our strong position in the marketplace to capture the growth potential we see and to proactively manage the operations of our business to maximize profit, cash generations, and our overall return to our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. At Accenture, we're extremely focused on executing our growth strategy. And our record new bookings for the second quarter and for the first half of the year demonstrate that our services remain highly differentiated and are clearly resonating with the needs of our clients.","One of the things that truly sets Accenture apart is that we combine our capabilities across consulting, digital, technology and business process outsourcing to deliver tangible results for our clients.","Let me bring this to life with some key wins in the second quarter. We were selected by a global communications equipment company to provide HR, IT and finance and accounting services as part of a multi-year business transformation that is expected to deliver cost savings of more than $1 billion.","We signed a long-term agreement with Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a large Italian bank, to provide finance and accounting, administration and other back office services as part of a strategic restructuring plan to enhance the bank's competitiveness in the marketplace.","We were also selected by a high tech leader in security systems to support the company's transformation across more than 90 countries. We will provide HR, finance and accounting and procurement services, leveraging our recent Procurian acquisition to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.","And I'm personally very pleased that a few weeks ago, we announced a unique new business model with SAP that we believe is a true game-changer in the industry. Through the newly formed Accenture and SAP Business Solutions Group, which includes dedicated experts from both companies, will jointly develop integrated, industry-specific and cloud-based solutions.","Our broad industry and technology capabilities have enabled us to build long and enduring client relationships with the world's leading companies. We continue to operate at the heart of our clients' businesses, especially when it comes to executing large scale, mission-critical programs that deliver tangible outcomes.","For China Electric, we designed, implemented, and deployed a salesforce.com solution to more than 26,000 users in 100 countries, the largest sales force implementation in Europe. The new cloud-based solution has already delivered value by increasing cross-selling and account coverage by 20%.","For Endesa, one of the world's largest electric power companies, we're supporting the rollout of more than 13 million smart meters in Spain. Through a multi-year business process outsourcing agreement, we're facilitating the expansion of smart metering operations and integrating existing billing systems and business processes.","And for a global pharmaceutical company, we're arming sales reps with a variety of digital technologies across tablets, smartphones and PCs, to deliver a personalized user experience to doctors in more than 200 countries. These new digital promotion and sales program has already delivered $15 million in savings.","Turning now to the geographic dimension of our business. In the Americas, we grew revenues 4% in local currency, which is consistent with Q1. Growth was driven by the United States and we're pleased that our business in Brazil is starting to turn the corner.","In EMEA, revenues were flat in local currency compared to the second quarter last year. We're starting to see good pickup in growth in important countries such as Switzerland, the U.K., Italy, Germany and France. And in Asia-Pacific, we grew revenues 4% in local currency, driven by continued strong growth in Japan.","Before I close, I want to share something I'm personally very proud of. You have often heard me speak about our diamond clients, which are our largest client relationships and increasing the number of diamond clients is clearly a priority for us to drive more growth.","I am pleased that we added 16 new diamond clients in the first half of the fiscal year, which brings us to a net total of 138 diamond clients, an all-time high.","Before I hand back to David, I want to comment on the global economic environment which, frankly, continues to be challenging especially in the emerging markets. As you would expect, we're carefully monitoring the recent geopolitical developments in Eastern Europe, which are introducing an additional level of uncertainty in the marketplace.","That said, given our strong bookings year-to-date and the level of activity we're seeing, I continue to feel confident that we're well-positioned to drive more growth in the second half of the year.","With that, I will turn it back to David who will provide our business outlook for Q3 and the full fiscal year.","Dave P. Rowland","Thanks, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook and let me start by saying based on where we are for the first half of the year, we've of updated most of the metrics in our business outlook.","For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.65 billion, this assumes the impact of FX will be flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2013.","For the full fiscal year 2014, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 0.5% compared to fiscal 2013.","With strong bookings in the first half of the year, balanced with 3% revenue growth year-to-date, we now expect net revenue for the full fiscal 2014 to be in the range of 3% to 6% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2014, we now expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $36 billion.","For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2014 to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2013 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5%.","For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.62 or 7% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal 2013 results.","Turning to cash flow. We now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, with property and equipment additions remaining at approximately $400 million, and free cash flow now in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion.","We've lowered our cash flow guidance to reflect our updated assumption that we will accrue lower variable compensation due to higher current year operational spending as compared to what we assumed in our original guidance range.","Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also now expected to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 3%, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that, let's open it up, so that we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Tom, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?","Question-and-Answer session","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","Our first question today comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang representing JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Great. Thanks so much. I want to first ask on the comment that you made on contract productivity and pricing pressure, can you elaborate there? Are you -- sounds like you're unable to pass along higher payroll costs or maybe you're seeing outright pricing pressure, can you elaborate in what areas? Thanks.","Dave P. Rowland","Yeah I would say, Tien-Tsin, by the way, hello, good to talk to you this morning, I would say that the dial is probably turned up a little bit since last quarter in terms of the pricing environment and there's a couple of factors that are worth noting. One is that the ongoing trend in vendor consolidation is influencing the pricing environment.","And then secondly, we have seen more pricing pressure, if you will, in certain areas, and in particular in the application services area where the environment competitive characteristics are such that price is becoming very prominent in the bidding process. So, that's what we see on the pricing front.","We also have seen some pricing pressures on our existing book of business and what that means specifically as you alluded to is we're a little further behind where we had expected to be and able -- in terms of being able to pass cost rates through on our existing contracts. And so those are the two dynamics that we saw in our second quarter results.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Understood, makes sense. Just my follow up then just -- obviously the bookings were very strong, high book-to-bills in consulting which is great. Just curious though on the revenue productivity or the revenue production, I guess, that came in the middle of guidance after beating the last couple of quarters, if I'm remembering that correctly. So, what are the biggest factors that changed in terms of revenue production this quarter?","Dave P. Rowland","Well, I would -- Tien by the way, I think last quarter we were at the upper end of the range. But I think one factor clearly is what we just talked about, is the pricing both on new work and existing work and then how that ultimately impacts the conversion to revenue.","We do see a situation in consulting in particular where from a volume standpoint we're actually seeing very strong growth, and in fact, I would say that our volume growth is where we expected, if not better.","The pricing environment is impacting that such that we're getting the net result in our revenue growth in consulting in particular.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","That's helpful. I appreciate it.","Dave P. Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney. Please go ahead.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi, just going back to pricing, could you help us reconcile -- and usually pricing competition is an indication of either a slowdown or a maturity, yet the bookings are really strong. Can you help us reconcile those two pieces?","Dave P. Rowland","Well, let me make a comment and then Pierre may have a few comments as well. I would say in this case to the contrary the environment is actually quite strong. We feel very good about our pipeline, even with the conversion of such a large portion of our pipeline to bookings last quarter. So, the level of client discussions that are taking place and clients' willingness to contract work is actually quite strong.","Having said that, if there is a common theme and we've talked about this for several quarters now, clients are by and large focused on cost optimization. I think that is a trend that we see almost in every industry and every market around the world.","And so clients are moving forward, driving the business forward, looking at investments that they need to make, but they're doing it with an eye towards being very cost conscious in the contracting investments they're making in their business.","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah, without piling on David, this is exactly right. We see demand in the marketplace. Definitely reflecting result, very strong bookings both in consulting and outsourcing and we have excellent win rates as well.","So, the main issue -- and we're working on it, or challenge if you will more than an issue, because we're working on it, is more in application services. This business is highly competitive and clients continue to be very mindful, thoughtful, good negotiators with procurement and so it's putting some very specific pressure in that part of the business.","Now, that being said, we have other parts of the business and I'm thinking about digital, for instance and consulting, where the price is stable or even we can pass the price. So, it's always the same pattern, if you will.","When you can differentiate and provide differentiated innovative solutions, you can keep your price stable or even improve your price. But in the market which is more like application services, less around innovation, if you will, even if we're working hard on it to differentiate, there is some price pressure because the competition is quite intense.","Dave P. Rowland","And I'll just -- without piling on, there's probably one other nugget which is worth noting, is that the success that we've had with the larger transformational deals, we've actually seen very stable pricing on those large contracts that as a portfolio has met our expectations.","We have seen, as I called out in my prepared comments, that on many of these contracts, the way they are structured, the profitability is a little lower in the earlier term of the contract. But overall, the pricing for these larger contracts where we are highly differentiated has held up very well as well. ","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up obviously guidance is backend loaded in your fiscal year. Maybe you could give us some color as to where the confidence is coming from that that's going to be the progression throughout the year.","Obviously the bookings are strong, but we've seen quarters in the past where there's been a slower conversion rate of those bookings. So, are these large deals that are going to hit in the back half of the year, how should we think about the ramp?","Dave P. Rowland","I think there's probably four things I would call out. The first thing I would say is that first of all, we've got the foundation generally that we expected to be at the halfway point and so there's no real surprises -- excuse me, from that perspective.","The second thing is the fact that we do have strong -- very strong bookings and in fact, if you look at the bookings we've had over the last two quarters, it is as strong as any two quarter period we've ever had.","The third thing I would say is that -- excuse me, the three themes that we called out last quarter, which you may remember, we talked about the impact that the transformational deals that we've sold over the last several quarters, the revenue ramp that we see in those contracts.","We talked about the investment that we have made in business services and how that would begin to impact our revenue in the second half of the year. And then we also talked about the return that we would get from the investment that we have made in several acquisitions and the impact that that would have. Excuse me; I actually have a frog in my throat. But those are the main things I would call out in terms of the reasons for our confidence in the back half of the year.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you. ","Pierre Nanterme","Sorry for the frog, David. Hopefully, nothing to do with the (indiscernible).","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Water could probably help right there.","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah, yeah, nothing personal between David. But -- no you're exactly right; I think we feel confident with the second part of the year, exactly that we are where we expected to be. And the large scale transformation program together with the return on the investments we're making and good pipeline, good book-to-bill, and good contracted revenues as well. If you combine all of these factors, they represent a strong basis for confidence for the second part of the year.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead sir.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, I had two questions also if I could. The first is on the consulting side. Your book-to-bill was very strong this quarter. If I look back over the last six or plus quarters, it's been over 1, yet it hasn't translated into positive revenue growth.","So, in the February quarter, it was a relatively easy compare, it still came in zero. Could you comment on how you see the growth over the next couple quarters in consulting specifically, please?","Dave P. Rowland","Yeah. For the full year, we still see consulting being flattish to low single-digit positive. With our outsourcing, by the way, being mid-to high single-digit positive, so our view of consulting really hasn't changed from where it was when we started the year.","Again, a little bit of connecting the dots between the bookings and the translation to revenue is what I referenced earlier, is that we actually are seeing quite a bit of growth from a volume standpoint.","What we've seen is in the application services area especially is that we've seen a higher ramp-up or a reacceleration, if you will, in using our global delivery network. And so we have -- if you looked at the work that we're delivering to our clients in volume terms in consulting overall, it's actually up quite nicely.","But again, we've got the dynamic of the revenue yield per hour as we're using our GDN capability at a higher level compared to the same periods last year. This is a dynamic that we've seen before. It's part of the ebb and flow of our business. We've managed through it before and we're in the process of managing through it now.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Well, then my follow-up relates to the cash flow. You mentioned that cash flow guidance is coming down. I think you said, health is lower variable comp, but I heard is operational investments. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on what those operational investments are? Thank you.","Dave P. Rowland","Yeah, to be clear, it was not operational investments, it was operational spending. So, if you think about it -- so we started the year with an assumption in our cash flow guidance for what our accrued variable comp would be.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Right.","Dave P. Rowland","As that -- as our assumption has come down for the year on that now, by about $300 million, that assumption for accrued variable comp has been replaced by operational spending, if you will, that has cash out the door as compared to the accrued variable comp which has no cash out the door this year, would have cash out the door next year.","And so that dynamic is what has impacted our cash flow, which you could say is as much as anything else a timing issue, because to the extent has an unfavorable impact on us this year, it will have a favorable impact next year if the scenario plays out because we would obviously have less cash out the door next year.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","But David what are those operational investments incremental?","Dave P. Rowland","It would primarily be higher base payroll, as an example. With the volume growth -- in fact, as you look at our headcount statistics, you'll see that our headcount growth over the last couple of quarters has been meaningful and so we have more heads, more payroll, base pay comp. We also have slightly lower utilization on the margin as we've been building bench in certain areas in anticipation of revenue ramping and so all of those dynamics come into play.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","All right, fair enough. Thank you.","Dave P. Rowland","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Hey, thanks guys. So, I want to get your views on this pricing and mix shift to offshore, as far as how much of this you think is structural and kind of a new normal going forward. I know you're obviously talking about the application services piece, or do you see this as being more of a one-off?","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah, I -- both, if you will. I think what we've seen is there is a structural shift, if you will, from offshore -- onshore to offshore, especially in application services and something at Accenture, we embraced a long time ago and we have every year more resources offshore participating to the application services and that will not change.","We will continue to have global delivery network and we will continue to try to find the right mix between the offshore and the onshore. So, this thing is more like, if you will, a secular trend.","Now, for all the reasons mentioned by David, at some point in time, different factors are combining and impacting our pricing situation. We mentioned some renegotiation in the context of vendor consolidation. It has happened more in this quarter than other quarters.","David mentioned that when you're selling large scale transformation program, typically the first year from a pricing standpoint are more dilutive and then in terms of margin and then you're recovering at the backend of the program.","So, I think we had a combination of factors in Q2 that has put pressure on the pricing. But the offshoring trend, this one is no change and is structural.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Okay. And then just for my follow-up, coming back to the point on reducing the accrued comp by $300 million or so this year, can you give us a sense of what percent cut in the total accrued comp is the $300 million? And then do you have any concerns about the downstream impacts on attrition potentially?","Dave P. Rowland","Yeah, and it is important to have a little bit of context on this, so that it is not misinterpreted. The first thing I would say is that the -- this particular program that we're referencing is one program as part of a much bigger set of variable comp programs that we have in the firm.","And if you look at our variable comp accruals overall, as I said in my prepared remarks, we accrued a significant amount of variable compensation. In this one particular program, which is targeted at our managers and above, it's not the only variable program targeted at them, but for this one program that is targeted to the managers and above where the determination of what we accrue in a quarter is based on a formula tied to specific financial metrics.","In this particular program we have accrued less. And for the full year, we expect that it could be in the $300 million range based on our current scenarios, although we are working hard in the back half of the year to improve that. But you have to look at that $300 million in the context of a payroll structure that is roughly $20 billion overall.","So it's meaningful in the context of our cash flow guidance, which is why we called it out so that you could understand the change to cash flow. In the context of our overall payroll structure its $300 million on a total base of roughly $20 billion.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Right. But the vast majority of the $20 billion is just base pay, right?","Dave P. Rowland","Well, you say -- well, vast majority would be a true statement. We do have significant variable comp in our plan, but it would be true to say that more of the comp is fixed than variable.","Pierre Nanterme","Indeed. And so, to answer your second question, whether we are concerned or not? I'm not pleased, but I'm not concerned. I'm not pleased because it's always better to accrue all the valuable comp incurred. Now, I'm not concerned because first, its mid-year, and I guess we have time to recover in the second part of the year, especially as we see the business shaping for the second part of the year.","As David mentioned, this piece is more targeted to our executive and leaders. So I'm taking that as a strong incentive for them to perform in the second part of the year, so they will receive their valuable comp.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Very good. All right. Thank you for the comments.","Operator","Next question today comes from the line of Edward Caso representing Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about Accenture Digital Services? You didn't really mention that. I was sort of surprised.","Pierre Nanterme","Couldn't be more pleased with Accenture Digital, and you're right. Frankly, thanks a lot for your question because we -- of course, we had to explain a part of the business where we have either not issues, but challenges of thing we want to be very transparent with you and talk where we are.","Now, the vast majority of our business is doing just extremely well. That's why I wanted to share with you couple of programs including what we are doing for this pharmaceutical company, which is quite a large scale digital business.","So we set up Accenture Digital January 1. In Accenture Digital we have now 23,000 people plus. So we have probably established in January one of the largest digital organizations in the world. We're combining all is related to digital marketing with Accenture Interactive, Accenture Mobility around mobility and Accenture Analytics. And we're very pleased with the result of this unit which is continue to grow, I would say, with strong double-digit.","So very, very pleased, the level of demand is extremely high. But more important, I truly believe that Accenture is differentiated in the marketplace. We are more end-to-end than anyone else in digital marketing. Our Mobility organization is just on fire. And, as you know, there is great demand for analytics. And, of course, through the creation of Accenture Digital, we have the unique ability now to create synergies among these three capabilities and be even more end-to-end. So we're extremely pleased with Digital.","Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities","Got it. Can you break out the components of the health and public services that help the European government, the U.S. government? Give us a sense where strengths and weakness are.","Pierre Nanterme","I could. I mean, let me start, because indeed in HPS you have the H and the PS. We commented a lot on heath which continue to be an industry we're very pleased, we're very proud. We made significant investment three years ago and now we're getting a strong return.","If you're looking on a year-to-date basis, its one of the industry where we're still growing double-digits, so its part of our top performing, specially in the U.S., but as well in other part of the world, in Asia-Pacific to name a few.","PS is indeed a different story. And it has been this last years. We continue to be very pleased with what we are doing in the public sector, probably more in the U.S. standpoint. Europe continued to be a challenge from a public sector spending which is probably not a big new news.","Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. Thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Ed.","Operator","And next we'll go to line of James Friedman with SIG. Please go ahead.","James Friedman - SIG","Hi. Thank you. Pierre, could you elaborate on your comments regarding Brazil and share some context through that?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, of course. Probably -- exactly a year ago we've been taken by surprise, to be honest, with what happened in Brazil. Brazil been performing extremely well for years. At Accenture we made right investments, we have the right leadership and it's still a country where we probably have one of the highest market share at Accenture. So all of this is not gone, but indeed 12 months ago we probably didn't anticipate what happened in Brazil from an economic standpoint, from a geopolitical standpoint and indeed, Brazil didn\u2019t deliver what we expected.","We've been working with the leadership of Accenture and the leadership of Brazil very hard this last four quarters to reposition Brazil for new growth. And I'm pleased to report that indeed in Q2 we feel that we are turning the corner with Brazil coming back flattened, hopefully positive for the reminder of the year. This is what I mentioned by turning the corner. So we worked hard for four quarters and I guess Brazil will be back with growth.","James Friedman - SIG","Thank you. I appreciate the context.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Bryan Keane's line with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Yeah, hi guys. Just a couple of follow-ups. Just on the Application Services area, I guess, I'm kind of wondering why now? I would have thought the move from onshore to offshore has already happened, so why in that particular area is it happening and kind of surprising?","Pierre Nanterme","This market is -- it's a very large market. If you look at the Application Services, it's probably one of the largest IT market in the world. So it's a market that's going to remain extremely competitive for long time. You have many providers, all extremely competitive and they all want to grow, they all want to take market share including us.","So I don't think it's the end of the prior era, if you will. It's just the continuation of what's happening. And you see many of our competitors, of course, you have the Indian pure players who are already very offshore-centric, if you will, but many of our more classic competitors are accelerating their move to offshore as well. And what we see which may be, let's put that in the new-new, is Europe is moving now offshore in a more robust way.","So if you look at this offshoring waves, first U.S. probably 10 years ago. Then they moved toward, what I like to call, the Anglo-Saxon corridor for whatever it means for you; U.S., U.K., Nordic, probably all the countries not speaking the same language like mine. And here you have also the reason earlier offshoring pickup.","Now, and I'm taking that as a good news for Accenture, continental Europe and I'm thinking about Germany, France, Italy, Spain, we see this offshoring picking up. So it's a good news for us because we've been able to leverage our Global Delivery Network, but it's creating a very competitive market as well in these four or five countries I mentioned.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","And the pricing and cost pressures, I assume it's going to continue for the back half of the year. What are the offsets you guys are planning to do so that it -- you can still grow margin?","Dave P. Rowland","Well, we are working in the areas where the environment is more competitive. First of all, we're working very hard on aligning the cost to serve or our delivery cost with the pricing realities, and that is ongoing.","The second thing that we're doing is that we are managing all of the levers of our payroll structure which we always do, but let's say we're doing it with an even higher level of intensity to make sure that we optimize the efficiency of our payroll structure against the revenue profile that we see.","We're also focused, as you would expect, on discretionary elements of our operating expenses. And then, we continue our journey in terms of our focus on our infrastructure cost and our business management function cost, if you will, and so, none of those things are new.","As I said, we go through periods like this. This is a normal ebb and flow in our business, and so the actions that we're taking they aren't new bullets in the gun. We're doing the things we always do to manage and optimize our profitability as the business ebbs and flows. And we feel good about the actions we have on the table.","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah. And at the end of the day, again, we feel confident in our ability to grow our revenues more in the second half of the year based on very clear facts. And as we will ramp up our organic growth in the second part of the year, we will be able to absorb more cost.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Very helpful. Last question for me. David, you said you're not expecting much improvement. It doesn\u2019t sound like in the constant currency consulting growth rate. I guess, with the bookings being where they are, they've been stronger. What's preventing that increase or acceleration in the consulting side?","Dave P. Rowland","Yeah. Flat to low single-digit positive. And again, I don't want to be redundant with what I've said earlier, but one of the things we're navigating right now in the consulting growth equation is this -- is the acceleration, if you will, of higher utilization of GDN for Application Services. But yet we see very strong growth in Digital. We see growth in other areas of our consulting business as well, but the mix of all of that together is what leads us to the flat to low single-digit positive.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Okay. I got you. Thanks so much.","Dave P. Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, thanks. Any update on the average deal compression you're seeing in SaaS deals? Is that where you're seeing any of the pricing pressure? And then, progress on driving new partnerships like the extended SAP relationship you talked about in order to offset that impact from SaaS?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. I'm going to take that one. And I'm very pleased to answer and very excited with what we are doing. If you look at the Consulting market, the ERP market, the Digital market; yes, this software or the added service world is evolving and is evolving quite rapidly.","As you've seen, for instance, we are very pleased with the business we're doing with the salesforce.com. I highlighted one of the largest European implementation of sales force. We did with Schneider Electric a few months ago. So very pleased with the progress we are making on the software-as-a-service.","We are investing, especially in the context of Accenture Digital, but as well in the context of our cloud activities to be much more relevant on this. And we are looking at critical partnerships to continue being differentiated in the marketplace.","I absolutely wanted to signal what we are doing with SAP, with this Accenture and SAP business Solutions Group where indeed we are going co-invest with SAP in quite a meaningful way to create very industry-specific and cloud-based and SaaS-delivered solutions. And we believe it\u2019s a true game changer. So I'm very excited with that. And what we are doing is very -- is so far unique in the marketplace.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley","And the average deal compression; is that still in the 15% to 20% range for SaaS deals?","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah. On the SI, on the pure SI, you're right. We are monitoring that very carefully. So if you look at the -- when you look at a program, you have the specification, you have the design, you have the change management, you have the integration, you have the testing and you have the integration in the company.","The system integration piece, which is part of this overall program, yes, we've seen this 20% to 30% less effort. What we've seen as well in this large program on SaaS a significant level of reinvestment of these savings in the other part of the program. So, all in all, as David mentioned, it's interesting to see that from a volume's standpoint the business is going up and is not going down.","Now, we need to manage, indeed, the equation around the pricing relative to the offshoring. But it's not the volume issue; it's more, as in this program we have higher level of offshore, it's putting some pressure on the pricing. So it's not a volume issue. It's how you're managing the new economics, if you will, and I'm extremely comfortable that we will manage that very well.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And then just a follow-up on bookings. As you know, you enjoyed strong bookings growth in 2012 that didn't convert to the same strong revenue growth last year. What's different about the recent double-digit bookings growth? Is contract duration changing or something else impacting your confidence that we'll see the revenue conversion this time around?","Dave P. Rowland","Well, again, I think what is different when you look at where we are this year to last year is that last year we are in a situation that we expected a broad uptick in the market that did not materialized. This year we're not expecting any change in market conditions.","Last year we had some concentrated areas of weakness that, as Pierre said using Brazil as an example, which were unexpected. But it wasn't just Brazil. There were a few other areas where we had concentrated areas of weakens. We don't see that this year. And, in fact, the areas where we had concentrated weakness have generally improved.","The third thing that we had last year is that we did have several large contracts that we're winding down. Where we had an assumption of our ability to replace those revenue streams and then grow on top of it that did not happen as expected, this year in the back half of the year we don't have that same dynamic. And that actually benefits probably four of our five operating groups as they turn to the second half of the year.","And then again, this year we've got we believe more line of site to sources of incremental revenue. And so, we have our eyes focused on the things that we have to do to deliver this uptick in revenue that we see. But we do think the circumstances, as we see it, are different than they were last year.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That's very helpful, David. Thanks.","Dave P. Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Darrin Peller representing Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Thanks. Just to follow-up on that question around the sort of book-to-bill timing. Is there a different in percentage of what's actually contract renewals here versus new business? And just in terms of the size of these contracts and how long they really take to accrue to revenue, for the outsourcing sides given how strong the growth has been there, can you give us a little more color on the characteristics and the profile of those contracts today versus maybe what they used to look like a couple years back in terms of size as well as, again, how long you'd expect them to turn into revenue?","Dave P. Rowland","I guess if I just talk specifically about this quarter, I mean every quarter is different and any single quarter doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a trend. But if I just look at this quarter, as an example, we did have several very large contracts. And if you look at the average size of these large contracts on balance they are higher than what we've seen, let's say, over the last four to five to six quarters.","And because of that the duration of those contracts, or the contract term in this particular quarter has ticked up a little bit. But again, I don't know that I -- well, I do know that I would not declare that a trend. I mean, this -- the composition of next quarter's bookings, mega-bookings will probably be a little big different.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Right.","Dave P. Rowland","But for this quarter, we did see the average deal size go up and we saw the duration lengthened and that does have for the contracts we signed does have a dynamics in terms of how those convert to revenue with longer duration contracts.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","And you see these going up here?","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah. It is interesting to see, if you look at '13 and now the beginning of '14 that indeed we've seen the average for Accenture and probably because of our positioning, successful positioning in transformation in these critical programs that the size of the deal has been going up and the duration as well is a little bit longer. And this, of course, giving us the positive, it is giving us more visibility in our business on the long term basis. And, of course, we are monitoring carefully, as you might imagine, the rate of conversion from the bookings to revenue.","But from a visibility standpoint, we couldn't be more pleased that with our level of bookings and the size of the deal. And again, you mentioned David; we have 10 transactions over $100 million this quarter. And if you add Q1 and Q2, I guess we should be around $24 million.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Very good.","Pierre Nanterme","And if you compare -- which is a very big number. If you contrast to last year at the same period in time we were I guess around $21 million. So we are just slightly higher, but it's the demonstration that if you take '13 and '14 we are in the $20 million plus, if you will, transaction over $100 million, which is for me the confirmation of our positioning in terms of large scale transformation and that we are highly differentiated in that segment.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right. No, that is positive. And it's not like we're seeing more renewals as a percentage of the mix than prior years, right?","Dave P. Rowland","No. There's not anything notable in that regard.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Okay. All right. Just one quick follow-up on the organic. If you look at the quarter, what actually was the organic revenue growth rate versus -- I know there were just a couple of small tuck-ins, but\u2026","Dave P. Rowland","You know, as we shared before, we're really just not going to get into specifics on the organic and inorganic. Because again, our inorganic is really an engine for organic growth, and these businesses really within the first year, in most cases, become indistinguishable from our organic business because they get integrated very rapidly and Procurian would be the latest example of that where we will quickly -- are in the process of quickly integrating that with our existing procurement business and it's hard to tell one from the other.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Got it.","Pierre Nanterme","Okay.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right. Thank you, guys.","KC McClure","Tom, we have time for one more question then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar representing Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","Thank you. So I guess the question I had was with regards to the ramping of the App Services business. Most of your competitors operate their GDN at a higher level of profitability. My understanding is that you guys had normalized the cost equation there. So I'm trying to bridge the disconnect between App Services growing and your comments on profitability. How much of that is related to, Pierre, your comments that it was in the five countries that you mentioned which might have tougher labor laws and what's the timeframe then?","Dave P. Rowland","I mean what I would say is that our cost rates -- our GDN cost rates are extremely market competitive. And so, we don't segment our profitability by Application Services versus BPO versus Digital, etcetera. But I think just, Ashwin, just to may be correct the misperception that you might have is that our GDN cost structure is very competitive, which is why we are able to compete very effectively in the Application Services space. So that we should be clear on.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","No, no. That part I was clear and I was asking not less -- less about cost structure, more about the profitability, but we could take that offline. I guess my quick follow-up on a different segment is or different area is do you expect the relationship between your net income and conversion to cash flow to be different than before, not just this year, but going forward?","Dave P. Rowland","Well, Ashwin, what I would say is that all of the factors that have made us a strong cash flow generation business, those factors remain intact. We have a relatively capital-light business. We are very good at managing our billing and collections. And, as you know, we are focused on growing our business, gaining market share and having modest margin expansion.","And when you look at all of those things, we have to deliver on all those things, but if we do, fundamentally the structure that allows us to generate cash flow going forward should not be different than what its been in the past.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","The 1.2 times is a good\u2026","Dave P. Rowland","I didn't say 1.2 times, I've said that if you look at -- if you think about what would represent a strong cash flow generation, really cash flow equal to net income, would be indicative of a very healthy company. And we expect to be a very healthy company.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","Got it.","Dave P. Rowland","Thank you.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","Thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","It's five past. Thanks a lot for staying with us. I'm taking this as a strong confidence you're putting in Accenture and a strong interest in our company. So thanks again for joining us on today's call. With the first half of the year behind us, frankly, I feel very confident that we are well-positioned to deliver our business outlook for the year; and of course, the updated business outlook David mentioned.","We continue to execute a strategy that I believe is differentiating us in the marketplace. With the opportunity to strengthened our leadership position in large scale transformation program we talked a lot about it in digitally-enabled solution, a very strong market for us, and a new and innovative business services.","At the same time, we have a relentless focus on developing the skills and capabilities of our talented men and women around the world, more than 289,000 people around the world. So we can deliver the best of Accenture everyday and everywhere in the world.","We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions please feel free to call KC. Thanks a lot for paying attention to us. All the best.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay starting at 10:30 a.m. this morning and running through June 26 at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Paul, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 earnings announcement. As Paul just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. David will then provide our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2014. And then we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements, or net revenues.","Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, including the business outlook. You should keep in mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and that such statements are not a guarantee of our future performance.","Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me hand -- turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, which demonstrate our ability to continue to drive profitable growth in a volatile and fast-changing market environment.","For the full year, we once again increased market share, drove double-digit EPS growth and strong free cash flow and delivered value for our shareholders. David will provide more detail on both the quarter and the year in a moment, but here are a few highlights for the full year.","We delivered new bookings of $33.3 billion, an all-time high and near the top of our guided range. We generated revenues of $28.6 billion, a 4% increase in local currency. Fourth quarter revenues of $7.1 billion were above our guided range, and we were pleased with our double-digit growth in Health & Public Service and improved performance in both Resources and Communications, Media & Technology.","We delivered earnings per share of $4.93. After adjusting to exclude tax and reorganization benefits in the second and third quarters, earnings per share for the year were $4.21, a 10% increase.","We grew operating income and delivered operating margin of 15.2% for the year. After adjusting to exclude the reorganization benefits, we delivered operating margin of 14.2%, a 30 basis point expansion for the year, which was in line with our expectations.","We generated free cash flow of $2.9 billion, slightly above our guided range, and we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the year with a cash balance of $5.6 billion. We continue to return cash to shareholders with $3.7 billion in share repurchases and dividend payments during the year. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $0.93 per share, which is a 15% increase over our prior dividend.","In fiscal year '13, we, again, benefited from the diversity of our business, from an industry capability and geographic standpoint and made significant investments to position us well for the future.","Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you.","David P. Rowland","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As I review the results on this afternoon's call, you'll see that we delivered good results in quarter 4, starting with continued strong profitability and cash flow, but also delivering solid improvement in our net revenues with local currency growth of 4.5%. We saw improvement in revenue growth in quarter 4 with 4 of our 5 operating groups, the Americas and EMEA posting stronger local currency growth in quarter 3.","Overall, we continued to increase market share in a challenging environment while driving our business to deliver on our profitability targets and returning a substantial portion of our strong cash flow to our shareholders.","Now let's get to the numbers, starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were $8.4 billion, resulting in an all-time high of $33.3 billion in new bookings for the full year, which was also solidly in the upper half of our business outlook range provided in June. Consulting bookings were $3.8 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.0, consistent with what we signaled last quarter. Outsourcing bookings were very strong at $4.6 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.4.","Taking a closer look at our new bookings, there are several additional points worth noting. All 3 components of our consulting bookings, management consulting, technology consulting and systems integration, were all at the low end of our book-to-bill range and very similar to our Q3 bookings level. And at the same time, we did see consulting bookings convert to revenue slightly faster than we expected.","Outsourcing bookings showed continued strength and represented our fourth highest quarter on record. Technology outsourcing bookings reflect continued strong demand for solutions that drive operational efficiencies and enable greater business performance and yielded a book-to-bill of 1.2 for the quarter. BPO bookings were particularly strong, the second highest quarter ever, and reflected strong market demand for finance and accounting, procurement and industry-specific offerings and financial services.","Lastly, we had bookings over $100 million at 11 clients, giving us a record 44 clients with bookings at this level for the full year, which reflects our strong position in the marketplace and helping our clients tackle their largest, most complex projects.","Now turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.1 billion, an increase of 3.7% in U.S. dollars and 4.5% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange impact of approximately negative 1%, which was consistent with the assumption we provided in June. Quarter 4 revenues were roughly $90 million above the upper end of our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected consulting revenues.","Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.3 billion, an increase of 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency.","So looking at our -- how our operating groups contributed to our revenue results for the fourth quarter. H&PS continued to lead the way with double-digit local currency growth of 13%, driven by a very significant growth in North America. We saw balanced growth across Health & Public Service in both consulting and outsourcing. After 9 quarters of double-digit growth, we expect H&PS growth to moderate in the near term.","Products delivered 6% local currency growth in the quarter, slightly higher than their year-to-date performance, reflecting broad-based growth across most industries, across consulting and outsourcing and in both the Americas and EMEA. Financial Services grew 3% in local currency for the quarter and as expected, lower than the growth rate in each of the first 3 quarters. Growth continues to be driven by strong outsourcing activity, reflecting our clients' focus on large transformational projects.","Consulting revenues declined modestly, including lower levels of growth in insurance in the Americas as several projects are ramping down. Growth this quarter was also impacted by a tough year-over-year compare. We expect the growth rate in Financial Services to be similar in quarter 1.","CMT delivered 2% local currency growth in quarter 4, reflecting the improvement we expected. And we're particularly pleased with the performance in the Americas, especially in electronics and high tech. Resources also showed improvement with flat local currency revenue growth in the quarter, reflecting some overall stability in the business. We continue to work hard to reposition the business, especially in North America.","So moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.2% compared to 32.9% for the same period last year, up approximately 30 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 12.6% of net revenues compared with 12.3% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year.","General and administrative expense was 6.7% of net revenues compared with 6.9% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year. Operating income was $984 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13.9% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter 4 last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% compared with 32.8% for the fourth quarter last year. This lower rate in the quarter was primarily due to a lower level of reserve additions and higher benefits related to final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities.","Net income was $727 million for the fourth quarter, and it was $636 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 14%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.01 compared with $0.88 in the fourth quarter last year, an increase of $0.13.","Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continue to be industry leading. They were 31 days, up from last quarter and the 27 days in quarter 4 last fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.3 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $102 million.","Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at 8\/31 was $5.6 billion compared with $6.6 billion at 8\/31 last year, which reflects the significant level of cash returned to shareholders, a number of strategic acquisitions this year and our decision to fund the U.S. pension plan in quarter 1.","Moving to some other key operational metrics. We hired approximately 60,000 people in FY '13, ending the year with a global headcount of about 275,000 people, and we now have over 182,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 4, our utilization was 88%, consistent with quarter 3. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 12%, in line with quarter 3 of this year and quarter 4 of FY '12.","As it relates to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 14.5 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average share price of $75.57 per share. For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 34.4 million shares for $2.5 million at an average price of $74.05 per share.","Earlier today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $0.93 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents a $0.12 per share or 15% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. So before I turn things back over to Pierre, let me just briefly summarize where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our business outlook.","Again, new bookings were $33.3 billion, in the upper half of our guided range for the year. Net revenues grew 4% in local currency for the full year, at the top end of our most recent guided range and just below the low end of the range provided at the beginning of the year. Even though the second half of the year didn't materialize as we originally expected, we did grow faster than the market and take share, which is an important objective for our business.","As a reminder, we had 2 unusual items that impacted certain full year metrics in fiscal '13, for which we provided outlook ranges on both a GAAP and an adjusted basis. So excluding the impact, adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, within our most recent guided range and a 30 basis point expansion over last year and very importantly, incorporates a significant increase in our investments, including acquisitions, as we continue to position the business for future growth.","Adjusted EPS was $4.21, toward the upper end of our most recent guided range and 10% growth over fiscal '12. Free cash flow was just over $2.9 billion, slightly above the upper end of our previously guided range.","Finally, we returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, approximately $400 million above our initial objective, through $2.5 billion in share repurchases and $1.1 billion in dividend payments we made during the fiscal year. In addition, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 2%.","So all in all, in a market that grew less than we expected, our results continued to reflect rigor and discipline in the way we manage and drive our business. Once again, we've proven our ability to adapt our business as the environment evolves and to deliver results, which overall were very much aligned to the outlook that we set at the start of the fiscal year.","Back to you, Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. In a fast-changing market environment, we continue to execute our growth strategy in a highly focused and disciplined way. We are providing differentiated services across the full spectrum of our capabilities that are resonating with the needs of our clients. We continue to invest in our industry and technology capabilities to further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace, particularly in areas that will help us capture new ways of growth, such as digital marketing, mobility, analytics and cloud.","In fiscal year '13, we made significant investments including $800 million in acquisitions to enhance our ability to help clients compete in the new digital world. We are helping a leading European retailer enhance its customer experience by combining our capabilities in retail and Accenture Interactive, including our recent Fjord acquisition, as well as mobility and analytics. We are delivering seamless integration across all channels, including the client's 750 store locations.","In Belgium, we are working with Belgacom, the country's largest telecommunications company, and BNP Paribas Fortis to create the country's first mobile wallet. When fully deployed, the new solution, which is based on the Accenture Mobility platform, will enable secure shopping and payments via a smartphone.","We also continue to invest in new and innovative end-to-end business services that leverage our industry skills and combine our capabilities across management consulting, technology and business process outsourcing to deliver tangible outcomes for our clients.","In banking, we are strengthening our capabilities in Accenture Credit Services through 2 recent acquisitions. In Q4, we acquired Mortgage Cadence in the U.S., adding an advanced loan origination software platform. And just last week, we acquired a majority stake in Vivere Brasil, a leading mortgage processing technology company in the rapidly developing Brazilian mortgage market.","In capital markets, we created Accenture Post-Trade Processing, a new business service to provide clearing and settlement of equities and bonds for investment banks. This service, which is priced by the transaction, should help clients cut their securities processing cost by about 30%. We are already working with our first client, Societe Generale, and have several others in the pipeline.","And in the hospitality industry, we launched Accenture Hospitality Services to capture the growth opportunities we see in providing finance, accounting and related services to hospitality companies. We are working with our first client, Marriott, and their franchise hotel owners to deliver significant cost savings.","At the same time that we invest in innovative business services, we remain extremely focused on supporting our clients in their large-scale transformation programs as demonstrated by our 11 bookings over $100 million in Q4, which you heard David mention. Our clients continue to focus on driving more productivity and effectiveness in their operations, and this is generating demand for our core services.","We are in the early stages of helping a global agribusiness company, with 30,000 employees, transform its business through an ERP implementation across 140 countries. We will help and answer client's efficiency and decision-making, supporting its global expansion plans.","And we're working with Vodafone on a major IT transformation, based on an integrated global ERP solution from SAP, as well as cutting-edge technology for mobility and analytics. More than 85,000 employees across 20 operating companies are now live on the platform. Vodafone has benefited from more transparent information and standardized processes that will improve reporting, drive better decision making and enhance risk management.","And just this morning, we announced an IT collaboration with Telenor, a leading global telecommunications provider, to manage the development and maintenance of IT systems with the mobile value chain.","From a geographic standpoint, needless to say, we are living in an interesting world. A year ago, the big questions were around Europe and the sovereign debt issue. It now seems that Europe is stabilizing and even showing some early signs of improvement. And today, the question is around the emerging markets, where we're seeing more volatility. In that context, the geographic diversity of our business continues to serve us well as we have a significant footprint in most of the major markets in the world.","Looking at the United States, our largest market, I couldn't be more pleased with our performance. We, again, delivered double-digit revenue growth in the U.S. for both the quarter and the full year, and we increased our market share. In our priority emerging markets, for the full year, we continued to grow at a faster rate at Accenture overall.","That said, it was a challenging year for our business in Brazil, and we expect to see stronger growth in fiscal year '14. At the same time, we were very pleased to see continued strong double-digit revenue growth for the year in China, India, the Middle East and Mexico.","In closing, at a time where volatility and uncertainty are still the name of the game, we continue to focus on driving our own competitiveness, applying rigor and discipline across the board to increase our efficiency and expand our margins. And this is giving us the capacity to invest in the business to continue to capture new ways of growth.","Before I hand back to David, I want to thank our people at Accenture for their significant contribution to our fiscal year results. Our people are extraordinarily committed to the success of our clients and bring their unique knowledge and capabilities to their work every day.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our fiscal year '14 business outlook. David, over to you.","David P. Rowland","Thanks, Pierre. Before I provide our business outlook, let me share some thoughts on how we see the overall environment and the implications on our view of fiscal '14.","For the past 4 to 5 quarters, it's clear that our addressable market has been in a cycle of lower growth, and this has certainly impacted our growth. As we look forward, we think it's likely that our overall market conditions won't change much in the near term. In other words, it will be more the same. Regardless of how the market evolves, we are driving our business throughout the cycle to grow faster than the market.","Turning now to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal '14, we expect the revenues to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.3 billion. This assumes a foreign exchange impact of approximately negative 2% compared to the first quarter in fiscal '13.","For the full fiscal year '14, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to be negative 1% compared to fiscal '13. For the full fiscal year '14, we expect Accenture's net revenue to be in the range of 2% to 6% growth in local currency over fiscal '13.","For the full fiscal year '14, we're targeting new bookings to be in the range of $32 billion to $35 billion. And in consulting, we expect quarter 1 bookings to be similar to the last 2 quarters.","For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '14 to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '13 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '14 to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.54 or a 5% to 8% increase over adjusted fiscal '13 results.","Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '14, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately $400 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion.","Finally, we expect to return at least $3.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.","With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, David. [Operator Instructions] Paul, would you provide instructions for those on the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So your revenue growth took a step in the right direction in the August quarter, but bookings were down year-over-year in consulting and outsourcing and your fiscal '14 bookings guidance calls for flattish bookings versus fiscal '13. So overall, are you seeing overall stable to improved demand trends as implied by the August quarter revenue growth results? And if you are seeing overall stable to improved demand, is this not showing up in recent and projected bookings due to a drop in duration or some other factor in your outlook?","David P. Rowland","Rod, I'll start with a few comments, and then I'm sure Pierre will have a few things to add. In terms of the demand environment, one key measure we look at is our opportunity pipeline. And we saw -- have seen good expansion in our opportunity pipeline across most aspects of our business over the last 90 days during the fourth quarter. And that is indicative of the level of client discussions that are taking place and the way our services and offerings are resonating in the marketplace. So we do feel good about our pipeline. And we think it's well positioned for what it needs to be to support the revenue range next year. As it relates to the bookings, the bookings -- we triangulate with our revenue growth based on what we believe we need from a book-to-bill standpoint, our conversion assumptions, et cetera. And we believe that the book-to-bill range that we guided to will support the revenue. On the consulting side, while we feel good about our pipeline overall, at this point in time, it is a little bit more early stage. And for that reason, we see quarter 1 consulting bookings being been pretty consistent with what we've seen the last 2 quarters, but yet we feel very good about the pipeline overall. It just has that early-stage characteristic at this point in time.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. Just to add, I must say I like the way you've been framing that, Rod, which is indeed I think the demand is I would characterize it as stable with some pockets of improvement here and there. And by and large, we're pleased with our pipeline and the way it's shaping. And -- but the overall demand I would characterize as stable plus, if you will.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you specify, at least roughly, how does your fiscal '14 revenue growth guidance break down between the consulting and the outsourcing business? And also, is your revenue growth in fiscal '14 more likely to be stronger in the first half of the year or the second half of the year? Are you assuming it's reasonably level-loaded across the year?","David P. Rowland","Yes. Rod, in terms of the breakout, we are -- we believe outsourcing will be in the mid to high single-digit positive. On the consulting side, anchoring to the 2% to 6% range, we see that on the low end as being flattish to low single-digit positive. And in terms of the revenue phasing, we do see our revenue building as we go through the year, coming off the range that we guided to for quarter 1 and then building from there. There are a couple of our operating groups in particular that for different circumstances are going to have lower growth in quarter 1, Financial Services being one and Health & Public Service being the other. I believe I called both of those out in the script. But yet, those are 2 operating groups that we feel very good about the positioning of the business, the pipeline, their contracted revenues. And we're very optimistic that their growth will be much stronger as they progress through the year.","Operator","Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to build on your last -- those last comments there, David, just trying to better understand Q1. I heard the FS and the Health & Public sector. You exited the year, what, 4.5%. Low end is down 2%. Is it really just those 2 segments that might push you negative there? Could we maybe argue that some of the revenue converted a little bit faster and pulled forward some revenue into 4Q? Just trying to better understand how much of that down 2% at low end is conservative versus some specific issues, if that makes sense.","David P. Rowland","Yes, I think, Tien-tsin, you know -- again, I think you hit the nail on the head again. It's -- the situation we find ourselves in quarter 1 is that we do have this cycle, this short-term cycle that H&PS and FS are going through, whereas prior to quarter 4, they were contributing at a very high rate relative to our overall growth. We also have resources in CMT which improved in the fourth quarter, and we feel good about how those businesses are moving along to return to positive growth. We think both of those operating groups will be positive for the year. But yet as we look at quarter 1, they are still very much working their way back up to where they want the business to be and where we want the business to be. So really, quarter 1 is just a reflection of H&PS and FS going through this period of lower growth, and then given some allowance for the fact that CMT and Resources are continuing to build, but we've got a little ways to go.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. So I get [ph] that 1Q and then jumping into 2Q is always a little bit tricky, but it sounds like the second half implied guidance should be relatively strong. I guess my follow-up -- there's no question there. My follow-up, I guess, I'll ask acquisition-wise. Did you give roughly how much some of these acquisitions could contribute to fiscal '14 top line? And then just generally speaking, there's been a lot more chatter up here about acquisitions that Accenture might be pursuing. I know Booz & Co. has come up a bunch. Can you comment on that in general, just your appetite for the larger acquisitions?","David P. Rowland","Yes, Tien-tsin, I'll just comment briefly. In terms of the contribution to the top line, it's still roughly in that 1% range. And I'll pass it over to Pierre, and he will certainly want to add some thoughts on acquisitions in general.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. Thanks, Tien-tsin, for the question. But indeed, we are executing our strategy against what we always shared with you from an acquisition standpoint. Our strategy in term of acquisition and the finance trajectory was to deploy at around 15% of our free cash flow around acquisition. And we've always been clear that it might be a little bit more or a little bit less depending on the opportunities in the marketplace and how attractive they might be for us to invest for the future. It happened that this year indeed, we found pretty attractive opportunities in the marketplace and we deployed in the range of $800 million. So this is consistent with our strategy. And indeed, moving forward, we will continue to execute these targeted strategic acquisitions, deploying around 50% of our free cash flow. We have the cash to deploy a little bit more. And of course, we're going to look at a good opportunity for us and for our shareholders to invest wisely.","Operator","David Grossman of Stifel.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Last couple of quarters you talked about bookings, conversion rates and the absence of some of the smaller quick type -- quick turn types of projects negatively impacting revenue growth. And now it seems like you've seen a little bit of improvement and that's changed a little bit this quarter. But that said, your assumptions around consulting growth remain relatively cautious it seems for fiscal '14. Can you help us better understand what you're seeing in the market? And what is the typical lag between better economic growth and improvement in these metrics?","David P. Rowland","Yes, I'll make a few comments on that, and Pierre may want to make some comments as well. But in terms of this whole conversion point, interestingly, we did see slightly better conversion in the fourth quarter than we expected, and that contributed to the revenue growth, the uptick in consulting revenue growth in the quarter. It's interesting to point out that, that was not because of an uptick in the smaller deals. The smaller deals were relatively stable from a volume standpoint. And for the market that is there, we feel like we're winning our fair share. But we really aren't seeing any uptick at least in the fourth quarter in the smaller deals. So it was really a situation where the deals in the $10 million to $50 million range, the characteristics of those deals were such that they just converted faster in the quarter. And that is everything from the timing of when the contracts were signed in the quarter to how quickly we were able to staff the jobs and get into revenue generation mode to also just the characteristics of the work we sold. And so we continue to watch this conversion very carefully. We think we've accounted for that appropriately in our FY '14 guidance.","Pierre Nanterme","Nothing to add, perfect.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, just looking at the changes going on at Microsoft and Nokia. I know you're recognizing you're close to both those companies. Does the sale of the handset business to Microsoft at all change the relationship with Nokia? And are there any specific headwinds or tailwinds that we should think about over the next several months as that deal takes shape?","Pierre Nanterme","No. I mean, the simple answer is going to be no. I mean, we do not expect any impact on our business.","Operator","Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk about the competitive environment? And last quarter, you guys had called out some areas where competition had increased. Maybe just kind of go back through that and just give us some sense on what your competitive landscape or pricing or any other factors are something to talk -- think about?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, again, and maybe you're going to hear a lot of that word in our answers is stable. I think we are -- I don't think we've seen any change. We are in a very competitive market. We are competing against all the classic incumbent, the companies from India, and you know that very well. I don't think there's been any change from a pricing standpoint. I would probably say that pricing is stable on balance. So again, no material change in that front. So we are in a very competitive market. And for us -- again, the name of the game is to concentrate on us, on Accenture, and to make the company more competitive to, as David mentioned before, to win in the marketplace, I think winning more than our fair share and gaining market share, and this is what happened in fiscal year '13. It's competitive and we're fighting to win.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Understood. And then just on the follow-up, just some thoughts around headcount. Headcount growth for this quarter, including acquisitions, looks like it's a little bit light. And then any thoughts for fiscal '13 gross headcount adds?","David P. Rowland","Yes, I would -- so we hired about 60,000 people this past year. We had our normal higher level of new hires hitting the books, so to speak, in the fourth quarter. We will hire, let me say, at least 50,000 people in fiscal '14. Supply management is a top priority for us always. I think we are very effective in terms of managing the supply-demand equation. And we will adjust the hiring as we need to as we progress through the year to meet demand and continue to operate at very high utilization levels.","Operator","Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The revenue guidance range this year is a point wider than fiscal '13, which implies some uncertainty. And if you back out the 1 point of acquisitions, the range sends a very different message at the low end with sort of flattish growth versus at the high end, more mid single-digit growth. So can you talk about what some of the biggest swing factors are that would land you at the low end of the range versus the factors that could get you to the upper end?","David P. Rowland","Yes, in terms of the range being wider, it really doesn't have anything to do with confidence as much as it does -- as much as it reflects the process that we go through every year to look at the size of our range as our business grows and as our business gets just more complex. And so we have that -- this discussion annually. There have actually been a few years in the past where we considered expanding to 4 percentage points. But this year, finally, as our business has gotten to the size that we are and as we are complex across so many different industries, geographies, et cetera, that range, we think, serves the business, and really our shareholders, the best in terms of giving good transparency to where we think we can land. In terms of how we think about either end of the range, I think I would describe that in the context of our 5 operating groups. What we see broadly as you look at the year is we see H&PS and Financial Services, as I said earlier, starting the year with lower growth but then building through the year to having very strong growth as they progress through the year. We see products continuing to produce at very good levels on a stable basis. And we see Resources and CMT continuing to build -- to be positive growth overall for our fiscal '14. Now where we land in that range of 2% to 6% is going to depend on the degree to which each of those things happens. But that is our model in terms of how we would rack and stack the operating groups and how we view their growth trajectory for the year.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned that Europe seems to have maybe turned a corner. Curious whether some of those ERP deals that didn't convert to revenue as fast as expected last quarter in southern Europe, whether that environment improved or whether it was more northern Europe?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I'm going to pick up, of course, Europe, I guess. Overall, my assessment on the situation is Europe is stable with hopefully, early sign of improvement. But you know the overall economic condition, probably all Europe been moving from a slight recession to a slight growth, but more or less -- being more or less the same plus. And indeed, what we've seen in Q4, but we will need to wait for Q1 to see whether it's going to be sustainable, is improvement in our growth in Europe and especially in countries -- important countries such as Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and France. And indeed, I mentioned our recent win that we announced this morning with Telenor, another European company. I mentioned Vodafone, again, a very well-known European company. So I will not declare a victory in Europe given the complexity of that continent until the challenges which are not being dealt with in terms of sovereign debt, growth, competitiveness. But definitely, Europe sounds more stable with early signs of improvement.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And was ERP specifically part of that improvement or not necessarily?","Pierre Nanterme","I would say not necessarily. I mean, some ERP sales have come up -- are lumpy. It happened that we had a few this quarter. Overall, as we stated before, still continue strong demand for outsourcing and BPO because many of the European companies are still focusing on improving their competitiveness and addressing their productivity and cost efficiency and lower growth, if you will, in consulting. So pretty similar to the patterns we already highlighted prior in the year.","Operator","Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to follow up on that. How is overall ERP demand? And there's always a lot of questions about how cloud's impacting services. So just curious to your thoughts on if it's impacting your ERP business at all.","Pierre Nanterme","I will not mention a direct correlation between the cloud and ERP. When you look at ERP, fact of the matter is we've been through a cycle of very strong activity around ERP these last years and been a kind of wave. The reality is, and probably given the overall economic conditions and some softness in the investment from our clients, this recent cycle has been of lower growth around ERP. Now that being said, it's not true across the board. It's not true across all the industries. And it's not true all the geographies. That's why I will not mention any secular trend around the end of the era of ERP because there's going to be a new era of the cloud. Again, we've seen strong ERP activities in some of our verticals because there will always be a need for a very strong backbone to run your operation from a finance standpoint and from an HR standpoint, from a procurement standpoint and from a supply chain standpoint. That is going to move from one country to another and from one industry to another, and I think this is what it is. I would say that that's more cyclical than secular.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one question for David. When I look at consulting, it did 3% constant currency this quarter. And demand environment, I think you guys are staying stable to positive and we're hearing signs of enterprise spending generally getting better. But consulting guidance for the full year, I think you said constant currency flat to low single digits, which is almost a decline from the fourth quarter. I heard your comments on the first quarter. But I guess I'm surprised that there's no pickup in consulting kind of throughout the fiscal year. So I just want to make sure I understand why that is.","David P. Rowland","Well, again, I think we are influenced by what we have seen really for the last 4 or 5 quarters now in the consulting space. And we were pleased with what we saw in quarter 4. But yet, one quarter doesn't make a trend. So -- in many ways, it's been -- it's more of the same. We see some green shoots. We see some areas of potential strength. We see a pipeline. But yet, the market environment is such that it has not yet translated itself into a sustained upward trajectory of growth. And so when we see that, we'll call it as we see it. But at this point, we need to string together a couple of three quarters of seeing that before we could declare that as a trend and then factor that into our guidance.","Operator","Moshe Katri of Cowen.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You spoke a bit about Brazil, but you didn't say much about Japan, I believe. If I remember, Japan's high-tech vertical was weak last quarter. Can you kind of elaborate on that?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, so let me comment on Japan. So just starting by saying that I'm pleased with the overall performance of the...","David P. Rowland","He asked about Japan.","Pierre Nanterme","About Japan, oh sorry, sorry. So okay, Japan. When you look at Japan, indeed, we mentioned last quarter that we were challenged with the EHT activity in Japan. And again, it's more or less the same. We're working hard in Japan. And I'm pleased to report that we have some recent bookings that are giving us more optimism that Japan might turn the corner and get back to the kind of growth we might expect from that country. Now probably Japan is not totally out of the woods. We are still challenged, especially in the vertical you're mentioning. But it's interesting to see that this is exactly, in that vertical, that we're starting to see some opportunities in some of our recent bookings. So not yet there, but clearly sign of improvements.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. As a follow-up, on the outsourcings you already had [ph], as you said your book-to-bill looks very reasonable, very strong actually. Can you comment on conversion rate, conversion bookings there or conversion rates in general? Is there a change? Has that accelerated, or it's kind of the same?","David P. Rowland","Yes, we really haven't seen any notable change in the conversion rates on the outsourcing side.","Operator","Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about the moderation you're calling out in Financial Services and health care. How much is that cyclicality versus large projects? And how should we think about that? I know you talked about the ramp throughout the year, but how should we think about that in a more macro way?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, let me pick that one at the macro level, if you will. I think for HPS and Financial Services, I don't think there is, again, something structural. I think here we have some very, I would say, classic and cyclical situation. The 2 verticals have been doing very well, of course, on the back of some strong and large program, which is very typical at Accenture. It happened that some of these large program are naturally coming to an end, and they need to be replenished, and that's happening on a regular basis in our business. It happened that for both HPS and Financial Services, we have this impact in Q1. And so we mentioned this moderation of the growth. But in both of those 3 verticals, health, public sector and Financial Services, we are pleased with the level of pipeline as we can see it, and we are confident they're going to build again moving forward in the next part of the year.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my second question, I think this is a number of consecutive quarters where we've seen BPO have record bookings. Is it fair to say that you're seeing a shift away from those ERP projects to either new technology and outsourcing work? And if so, if that's a permanent shift, can we expect that bookings conversion rate to trend lower over a longer period of time?","Pierre Nanterme","I will comment overall on the BPO and let David commenting on the rest. BPO is doing very well, and we are doing very well in BPO. So I'm pleased to have the opportunity to acknowledge our people and our leader driving the BPO business. I mean, why -- I mean, first, there is a natural demand on BPO for the reason [ph] of cost management, productivity and efficiency and of course, business process outsourcing is a good response. But what's different with the BPO at Accenture? We invested a lot in BPO, first, and invested to create innovative services with a lot of analytics inside, what we're calling BPO Generation 4 or 5. But forget about the generation. Just to mention that we are investing in bringing more capabilities and more innovation out of our BPO. So there is a strong demand. We have differentiated solutions and services. And indeed, we invested as well through our acquisitions, as I mentioned before, because we believe it's a very good solution for our clients. So very pleased with where we are with BPO, and we believe there is a sustainable pattern here.","David P. Rowland","Yes, and we really haven't seen any structural change in the book-to-bill ratios or the conversion rates. I mean, we do have -- I guess to Pierre's point, we do increasingly integrate a lot of classic consulting type services with these BPO offerings, and that's a key point of distinction for us. But yet, we really haven't seen any structural change overall in the book-to-bill's conversion rates, et cetera.","Operator","David Koning of Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, in just looking at free cash flow, historically we go back and it had been about 20% to 50% above EPS for many years in a row. And last year, it was maybe 10% above EPS. And then this year, it looks like you're guiding to kind of in-line to maybe up to 10% above earnings. So I'm just wondering, is there maybe a little change, maybe even how you issue share-based comp? Or maybe why has free cash flow, that range, kind of narrowed?","David P. Rowland","Yes, I don't -- there really hasn't been any change. And if anything, through the years, our DSOs, at least until recently, they've been pretty steady at the current levels. But through the years, if you think about where we were originally as a public company and where we are now, our DSOs have actually gotten progressively better. So frankly, I'll have to give some thought to your question and look at that. But I can't -- I certainly couldn't put my finger on any structural change as you're implying, but I can give that some thought.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. No, that's great. And just, I guess, as a follow-up, if we look back very long term, you guys have, outside of recessions, generally grown somewhere around 10% or so top line. And I know now last year and this year, it's feeling a little more like low to mid single-digit growth. And is part of that just the moving into, I guess, more penetration of IT, that maybe we're just in a lower-growth period now for a sustained period? Or do you think you can get back to more that normalized 10% growth over some period of time?","David P. Rowland","Well, I think that the -- as I had mentioned in some of my comments, where we find ourselves right now is that we have been in a, certainly, in a 4 to 5 period -- 4 to 5 quarter period of just lower growth in our addressable market. And I mean, not to get into this too deeply, but when we talk about our addressable market, and it's the same approach we take for looking at market share, as we take this very fragmented market space that we're in, and we've chosen carefully, thoughtfully 40-some-odd companies that we think represent really the market that we're in. And we track the actual growth of that market defined in that way, and then we look at our performance against that. And if you look at that market, the addressable market as we describe it, that market has grown 2% to 2.5% probably on average if you go over the last 4 to 5 quarters. And what we're in right now is no different than cycles that we've been in -- many other cycles, where when you hit a period of low growth in our addressable market, even though we take share, the math is such that even taking share, our growth is going to be lower. And I think what you and we think about is how much the market will grow when we come out of the cycle. And then of course, when it returns to stronger growth, we'll continue to do what we do, which is take share in a stronger market.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, and to build on that and we're just looking at the numbers, if you look in the prior '08, the global economic growth has been in the range of 5%-ish. If you look at these last couple of years, the global economic growth has been in the range of 2%-ish. And at the end of the day, the addressable market is somewhat correlated to the global economic growth. I mean, that's a kind of natural correlation at some point in time. So the reality is that today, we're in a world growing at 2%. And as mentioned by David, the addressable market, the way we define, has been growing in that range. So we are executing against our commitment, which is anyway to grow more than the market and then deliver value to our clients and shareholders. But the world has changed.","Operator","Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I want to go back to the M&A question. And so if you spent, let's call it, $800 million roughly to gain, say, about $300 million of revenue contribution, which is about 1%, that's a pretty good-sized revenue multiple. So from a strategic viewpoint, what is it that these acquisitions bring you that you like so much? If you can explain on that, and then I have a follow-up.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, absolutely. What we like so much is the differentiation, the positioning and the future growth they're going to bring to Accenture. And first, if you want to buy good companies, you need to pay for it. This is as simple as this. You do not have so many good companies in the marketplace, so you need to prepare to pay for the quality. And second, we are concentrating our acquisitions in companies with differentiated assets, and not only with people and companies where you will find differentiated assets and solution and so proprietary IP, you have a multiple which is higher than the pure people-based kind of company. So we're always very thoughtful that we are paying the right price, that we are looking to pay the right price for right quality as well and the companies we acquired are very good in the context of BPO, in the context of Digital Marketing. You know the names. And we are very pleased with the returns so far, and we believe that indeed, they are bringing differentiated solution and assets that's going to position very well Accenture for the future.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. And then sort of a similar question on the ERP side, one question I get a lot from investors is how big is the ERP dependency for Accenture, specifically with regards to such things as license growth at partners like SAP and Oracle versus how much of that ERP work is long tail work like maintenance? If you could help us on that, it would be great.","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, we're managing a highly diverse portfolio of business. So of course, ERPs are important, and they are important for all the industry. It's the backbone of a lot of things our clients are doing in IT to build system and then in driving maintenance and so forth. But again, we are a very highly diversified company. We are doing ERP, and we are doing a lot of other things in our portfolio of business. I'm thinking about what I'm mentioning in Digital Marketing, in mobility, the way I studied around mobile wallet; look at analytics, which is a growing part of our business as well; cloud-related activities; and I can mention many other activities. So yes, ERP are important. And yes, we are not dependent only on ERP given our diversified portfolio of business.","KC McClure","Paul, we have time for one more question, and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","The last question today is from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Pierre, you alluded to higher volatility from the emerging markets. Brazil, of course, was a theme in last quarter's call. Can you elaborate on which other markets you're seeing higher volatility and how that's affecting demand patterns in consulting and outsourcing?","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, frankly, the one with the highest volatility and probably caught us by surprise to be honest will be Brazil. We had a very strong growth over many years. Brazil was, as you all know, a place where many of our clients have been investing for quite a long time. And what happened in Brazil probably caught our clients and ourselves a little bit by surprise with what's happened now. Brazil is going to come back because when you look at the fundamentals of Brazil, they are still very strong. They have the population. They have the middle class. They have as well natural resources. So the fundamentals are there. They just need probably to get to some level of consolidation, put our act together from a political and economical standpoint and then the growth will come back in Brazil. For the rest, frankly, I'm very pleased with one country which is very important for Accenture but going to be extremely important for the future is China. I mean, China is going to be the second largest economy in the world. We all know how strong is China. And frankly, double-digit growth in China these last quarters, not to mention these last couple of years, I'm extremely pleased with what's happening. So for the rest, we might see a little bit more maybe volatility, if you will, in countries such as South Africa. I think it might happen in countries such as Russia as well for all sorts of reasons we might all understand. But what's important for us is to have some critical anchor countries where we're putting some significant level of investment, leadership and attention. And for us, clearly, China is extremely important for the future of Accenture.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then any thoughts on consulting versus outsourcing in the largest emerging markets in terms of growth and demand trends?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I mean, good question because clearly in the mature markets today, you have a bias towards cost productivity, still efficiency for all sorts of reason we know, low economic growth. So a company to be more competitive, you need to be extremely mindful regarding your costs. And so you have this consequence around outsourcing and BPO being more in demand at consulting in that cycle. If you move to the emerging markets, they're still in an environment where you need to build capabilities. And it's not a surprise that we see some ERP work or build work or consulting work, for instance, in countries such as China, where you will see probably more consulting than outsourcing in countries such as China. So it's probably fair indeed, David, to call that in emerging markets, it's going to be more skewed towards consulting versus outsourcing and in mature markets, it's going to be the other way around. Again, that's why I couldn't be more pleased, if you will, with the diversified portfolio of business because at the end of the day, we have the opportunity to balance our portfolio from a consulting to outsourcing standpoint, from mature to emerging market from multiple industry standpoint. And I think this is a recipe to make Accenture resilient in the cycle.","All right. I mean, thank you for joining us today. Really appreciated all the questions.","As we enter fiscal year '14, I'm confident in our ability to drive profitable growth and deliver our business outlook for the year.

[Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","And with that, I'd now like to turn the conference over to Managing Director of Investor Relations, KC McClure. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Doug, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2012 earnings announcement. As Doug just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. Pam will then provide our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013, and we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.","As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, including the business outlook. You should keep in mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and that such statements are not a guarantee of our future performance.

We include reconciliations of those measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are very pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, which enabled us to meet or exceed our annual business outlook for all of our key metrics. Our strong performance demonstrates that our growth strategy continues to differentiate us in the marketplace and that we are running our business with a focus on delivering value to shareholders. Pam will provide details on the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year in a moment.","Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered record new bookings of $32.2 billion. Revenue growth was strong and broad-based across our business, with an 11% increase in local currency to $27.9 billion, also a record. Earnings per share were a record $3.84, up 13% and at the top of our guided range. We expanded operating margin 30 basis points to 13.9%, also at the top of our guided range. We generated exceptionally strong free cash flow of $3.9 billion and continued to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the year with a cash balance of $6.6 billion.","We continue to return cash to shareholders, with more than $3 billion in share repurchases and dividend payments during the year. And we just announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.81 per share, which is a 20% increase over our prior dividend. Clearly, we continue to execute extremely well across all dimensions of our business, and I want to take this opportunity to recognize the contribution of the leadership team of Accenture, which is totally committed to our clients and to our success.","Now let me hand over to Pam, who will review the numbers in greater detail. Pam, over to you.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for listening today. I am pleased to give you some details on Accenture's fiscal year 2012 fourth quarter and full year financial results.","We finished the year strong across key dimensions. We had record bookings in consulting and outsourcing and a quarterly total, for the first time, of over $9 billion. Our free cash flow as we crossed year end was outstanding. And most notably, we were able to meet or beat all of the elements in our original annual business outlook provided a year ago.","Now let's get to the numbers for the quarter and the fiscal year. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP except the items that are not part of the financial statements or that are calculations. New bookings for the quarter were a record $9.2 billion, and that level of bookings also notably reflected a negative 9% foreign exchange impact compared with new bookings in the fourth quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $4.3 billion, and outsourcing bookings were $4.9 billion, both individual records.","As Pierre mentioned, new bookings for the full fiscal year also hit an all-time high of $32.2 billion, $1.2 billion above the upper end of the range we signaled in June. These bookings reflected a foreign exchange impact of negative 3% compared with new bookings for fiscal '11. Consulting bookings for fiscal '12 were $16.6 billion, and outsourcing bookings were $15.6 billion.","Let me give you some details on bookings in the fourth quarter, first in consulting. In management consulting, bookings were strong this quarter, particularly in the Americas and some parts of Europe. They continued to include a greater proportion of larger projects of longer duration with a focus on business outcomes. The strongest growth in bookings was for sales transformation and for finance and enterprise performance work.","Technology consulting bookings reflected demand for network transformation, data center consolidation, desktop transformation and IT strategy, all to drive cost savings and increase the business value of IT spend. We see more significant opportunities to capture here, and this is being focused on by our technology leaders.","System integration bookings were the highest for as long as we've been tracking them. Bookings continued to reflect client demand to implement and modernize both ERP and industry-specific systems, which is also creating platforms for advanced analytics work, driving more business value. We also see clients evaluating their legacy application portfolios, which is leading to growing demand to build and integrate Software as a Service or SaaS and other cloud solutions. And our clients' demand for mobile, digital and Web solutions across multiple types of devices is becoming more and more pervasive. Emerging technology trends are gaining momentum.","Turning to outsourcing. Technology outsourcing bookings continued to be very strong and broad-based across our operating groups and geographically across the Americas, Asia Pacific and parts of Europe and Africa. We continue to work closely with many, many clients around the world, not only to help them capture immediate cost savings, but to turn fixed costs into variable costs and to improve their IT effectiveness as they continue to work to transform their operations to become more competitive.","BPO bookings were very strong, a quarterly record, driven by our cross-industry offerings, especially finance and accounting. Bookings were broad-based across most of our commercial industries. Strong demand for our services was most pronounced in the Americas, including in the U.S. where we have our industry-specific solution and credit services. Our BPO business built momentum all year long in fiscal '12, with strong bookings driving increases in market share each quarter, and the business is well positioned going into FY '13 as well. Finally on bookings, we had bookings of over $100 million at 11 clients, with all 5 operating groups represented.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $6.84 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency over the same period last year. As we had expected, these revenues reflected a foreign exchange impact of negative 7% compared with Q4 last year. These revenues were at the upper end of our guided range of $6.6 billion to $6.85 billion and reflected growth in local currency in all 5 of our operating groups in the fourth quarter.","Consulting revenues were $3.74 billion in the fourth quarter, down 4% in U.S. dollars and up 2% in local currency. We had strong local currency growth in Asia Pacific, single-digit local currency growth in the Americas, and we're just under flat in local currency in EMEA.","Outsourcing revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. We saw a strong double-digit growth in local currency in all 3 geographic regions and across the majority of our industry groups.","Net revenues for the full fiscal year were $27.9 billion, an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the full year were $15.6 billion, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency. And outsourcing revenues were $12.3 billion, an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars and 19% in local currency. I'm pleased with the net revenue results delivered in fiscal '12 and how we continue to rise to the challenge of meeting our clients' evolving needs.","I'll take you through some Q4 details by operating group. Financial Services revenues increased 16% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific across all 3 industries: banking, insurance and capital markets. Consulting revenues, which reflected strong growth in insurance, grew modestly as the gains outweighed declines in banking in the Americas and EMEA.","In banking, transformation needs continue to evolve as a key driver of future demand. Consulting revenues also included the recognition of revenues related to higher-than-normal precontract costs incurred in Q3, as I mentioned last quarter.","Health & Public Service revenues increased 10% in local currency, reflecting very significant growth in health again this quarter, with strength in both consulting and outsourcing and across geographies. Our investments in health are paying off. Our health offerings are resonating in the market. Public Service had modest growth again this quarter, reflecting good demand for our offerings in some parts of Asia Pacific and globally in consulting for human services. Growing our Public Service business is still challenged in other parts of the world as we continue to reposition this business for the future.","The Products operating group, our largest, had local currency revenue growth of 8%, driven by very strong growth in outsourcing globally in both our technology and BPO offerings. From an industry perspective, growth was driven by retail, life sciences and industrial equipment in all regions. Both the Americas and Asia Pacific grew double digits. EMEA grew modestly as strong outsourcing growth was offset by a modest consulting decline again this quarter.","Resources revenues grew 7% in local currency, with growth across all industries, led by energy and natural resources. Strong growth in outsourcing reflected demand for flexible, cost-effective sourcing to meet increased demand in ongoing operations. Consulting growth moderated but continued to reflect solid global demand for operating model programs and a focus on driving short-term efficiencies. In utilities, we are building momentum with our Smart Grid offerings to support our clients in advancing their energy efficiency programs.","Communications, Media and Technology revenues increased 4% in local currency. Very strong outsourcing growth was driven by our clients' continued focus on improving the efficiency of their operation. Outsourcing growth included a short-term increase related to a contract with a client in Europe, which will ramp down throughout FY '13.","CMT's consulting revenue declined in all 3 regions. This was most pronounced in EMEA and in communications globally, where certain communications clients are -- continue to move away from building core IT system capability for traditional markets and to move toward more value-added services. In emerging markets and in high-tech globally, there is renewed system integration activity to build core capability on new platforms.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin in Q4 was 32.9% compared with 33.1% for the same period last year, a 20-basis point decrease. Gross margin for the full year was 32.3% compared with 32.9% in fiscal '11, a decrease of 60 basis points. Higher contract profitability was more than offset by investments in offerings and acquisition.","Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $839 million or 12.3% of net revenues compared with $821 million, also 12.3% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year. And sales and marketing costs for the full year were $3.3 billion or 11.9% of net revenues compared with $3.1 billion or 12.1% of net revenues in fiscal '11, a decrease of 20 basis points.","General and administrative expense was $469 million or 6.9% of net revenues compared with $472 million or 7.1% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year, a 20-basis point decrease. G&A costs for the full year were $1.8 billion or 6.5% of net revenues compared with $1.8 billion or 7.1% of net revenues in fiscal '11, a decrease of 60 basis points year-on-year.","Operating income was $940 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13.8% operating margin. This compares with $923 million, also 13.8% operating margin in the fourth quarter last year. Full year operating income of $3.9 billion reflected a 13.9% operating margin compared with $3.5 billion or a 13.6% operating margin for fiscal '11, a 30-basis point year-over-year expansion. In continuing to manage our business to modest margin expansion, we executed well to drive profitable growth, to invest in our business, including in gross margin, and to manage our cost structure in a disciplined way, i.e. to grow it at a rate less than revenue. This is what we set out to do, and we delivered.","In terms of operating groups, Health & Public Service operating income decreased year-over-year in Q4, and operating margins fell due primarily to delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts, some write-offs in our Public Service business in U.S. federal and investments in health initiatives. For the full year, I am pleased to again note that Products posted strong year-over-year operating income and operating margin gains and also that Resources delivered very strong operating income and margin all year long.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% compared with 27% for the fourth quarter last year. The higher rate in the fourth quarter of this year was due to increased reserves and a change in the geographic mix of income. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 27.6%, in line with our annual guided range of 27% to 28%.","Net income was $636 million for the fourth quarter compared with $683 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of 7%, and the decrease was driven by the higher tax rate. For the full year, net income was $2.8 billion compared with $2.6 billion in fiscal '11, also a record this year and an increase of 11%.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.88 compared with $0.91 in the fourth quarter last year. The $0.03 decrease is made up of a $0.03 increase from higher revenue and operating results, including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange this quarter; a $0.03 increase from a lower share count; which was more than offset by an $0.08 decrease from a higher effective tax rate; and a $0.01 decrease from lower nonoperating income.","For the full fiscal year, diluted earnings per share were $3.84 compared with $3.39 in fiscal '11, an increase of 13% and at the top end of our guided range of $3.80 to $3.84. The $0.45 increase is made up of $0.40 from higher revenue and operating income, including the impact of foreign exchange; $0.08 from a lower share count; offset by $0.02 from a higher effective income tax rate; and $0.01 from lower nonoperating income.","Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 27 days, down from 30 days both from last quarter and from Q4 last fiscal year. This was unusually low and did include an uptick in client prepayments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion rounded, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.7 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $115 million.","For the full fiscal year, free cash flow of $3.9 billion rounded was about $400 million above the top end of our previously guided range. This significantly higher level reflected better-than-expected DSOs, as I just mentioned, and also reflected the operating results in the quarter. Cash from operating activities was $4.26 billion, and property and equipment additions were $372 million.","Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at August 31 reflected the strong cash flow and was $6.6 billion. It compares with $5.7 billion at August 31 last year.","Moving to some other key operational metrics. We hired more than 60,000 people in fiscal '12 and ended the year with a global headcount of about 257,000 people. Our Global Delivery Network grew from 141,000 people at the beginning of the fiscal year to 162,000 people at the end. In Q4, our utilization was 87%, consistent with Q3. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 12%, down compared to 13% in Q3 and down from 14% in Q4 last fiscal year.","Before I turn things back to Pierre, I'll provide an update on how we performed in FY '12 on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 12 million shares for $696 million at an average price of $58.18 per share. For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 36.6 million shares for $2.1 billion at an average price of $57.32 per share.","In fiscal '12, we delivered on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. The total was $3.05 billion, reflecting $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $951 million in dividend payments we made during the fiscal year. Our weighted average diluted shares came down 2.1% over the fiscal year.","Earlier today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.81 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents a $0.135 per share or 20% increase over the previous semi-annual dividend we declared in March.","To sum up, we delivered all year. We executed our strategy, stayed close to our clients and were mindful of our costs. All of this allowed us to respond well to the stronger demand for outsourcing and moderated demand for consulting that evolved during the year. I'm very proud of Accenture people and their extraordinary ability to drive our business in a way that serves both our clients and our shareholders so well.","So let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you a brief update on some exciting things going on in our business, and then I'll finish up with our initial business outlook for fiscal year '13.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Pam. As our very strong results for fiscal year '12 demonstrate, we are executing our growth strategy in a focused and disciplined way, providing differentiated services that create tangible and measurable value for our clients.","Although the global economic and geopolitical environment remains volatile and uncertain, the diversity of our business continues to serve us very well. We are working with clients across 40 industries and more than 120 countries, providing a full range of market-leading services. We have an unmatched depth and breadth of industry skills, with 153,000 people in our operating groups and growth platforms aligned with specific industries.","As demonstrated by our record new bookings, we are seeing strong demand for services. Our clients continue to invest in transforming their operations to address the challenges presented by the long-term trends of globalization, regulation, rationalization and technology innovation. To help our clients address these challenges, we combine our unique capabilities across management consulting, technology and business process outsourcing to provide highly differentiated industry-based end-to-end services.","Let me bring this to life with some recent wins in the marketplace. We are helping Oi, one of the Brazil's leading communications providers, drive greater operational efficiency and transform its business. In addition to managing their billing and collection, finance and accounting, HR and supply chain functions, we are also leveraging analytics to target further process improvements to lower costs and improve quality across their business.","We are working with BP, the global energy company, to consolidate and run its finance and accounting function across Europe and North America. We are standardizing reporting and metrics and using advanced analytics to drive greater insights into the business with the goal of improving business controls, transcending risk management and reducing operating cost.","And at the same time, we continue to invest in building our industry expertise. I'm pleased to report that just this week, we completed the acquisition of Octagon Research Solutions, a provider of clinical and regulatory information management systems. The acquisition significantly expands the range of services we provide to pharmaceutical clients, enhancing our ability to help them achieve more efficient global regulatory submissions and enabling them to get medicines to market faster and at a lower cost.","I'm also pleased with the progress we made in fiscal year '12 in the fast-growing areas of cloud analytics and mobility, where we are now operating at scale in response to increased demand from our clients. In cloud, through a 5-year contract valued at more than $280 million, we are helping a major global client completely transform its sales, customer service and delivery functions worldwide. The new cloud-based solution is part of the client's efforts to increase revenue and customer satisfaction while also reducing operating costs.","In mobility, we are helping a leading company in the energy industry develop and roll out advanced mobile applications for its global workforce of more than 25,000 employees. The program will enable staff in remote locations to use mobile devices to access customer information in real time, significantly increasing efficiency and improving customer service.","As you know, geographic expansion is another key dimension of our strategy. We continue to invest in growth markets, both mature under-penetrated markets as well as our priority emerging markets. In fiscal year '12, we made good progress in our 10 priority emerging markets, increasing revenues 16% in local currency. We are particularly pleased with the growth in China, South Africa, Brazil and India, where we are executing very well and gaining market share.","I would also like to highlight our excellent results in the United States, which continues to be our largest market and delivered strong revenue growth of 13% for the year. And of course, we continue to run Accenture as a high-performance business, with a relentless focus on value, cost management and productivity to further improve our own efficiency and competitiveness and deliver on our commitments to shareholders.","With that, I will turn it back to Pam, who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year '13. Over to you.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre. I'd like to first share with you some thoughts on how our business is shaping up for fiscal year '13. We see very good opportunities in most markets around the world, and our Q4 bookings and healthy pipeline confirm this and position us well as we move forward. At the same time we remain very vigilant about understanding the impact of the evolving global macroeconomic environment, we will continue to be focused on managing our global business tightly.","For fiscal '13, we expect growth rates in outsourcing to continue to be higher than in consulting based on the book of business we have and the opportunities we see. While our consulting bookings have been solid in recent quarters, we anticipate they will continue to convert to revenues at a slower rate going forward as they did in the latter part of fiscal year '12.","Our outlook components and our intent to update you quarterly remain the same for fiscal '13. We will continue to provide a quarterly outlook for revenue so that you have a basis for understanding our quarterly-phasing expectations during the year. So for the first quarter of fiscal year '13, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.35 billion. This assumes a foreign exchange impact of negative 3% compared to the first quarter in fiscal '12. Our revenue outlook in Q1 reflects growth in 4 of our 5 operating groups and a slight decline in revenue for Communications, Media and Technology. We do anticipate that CMT will return to growth later in the fiscal year based on recent bookings and how new business is shaping up.","Let me turn to our assumption for foreign exchange for the full fiscal year. Based upon how the rates have been trending over the last couple of weeks, we currently assume the impact of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to be negative 1% for fiscal '13 compared to fiscal '12. This assumes the weakening dollar we've seen over the last few weeks. If the dollar were to return to the levels of a month ago, the FX annual headwind could be more like negative 2%. We will update the annual foreign exchange assumption each quarter.","For the full fiscal year '13, we expect Accenture's net revenue to grow in a range of 5% to 8% in local currency over fiscal '12. For the full fiscal year '13, we are targeting new bookings to be in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion. As you know, our bookings can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter.","In fiscal year '13, we expect operating margin to be in a range of 14.0% to 14.1%, a 10- to 20-basis point expansion. We will continue to balance profitability with making investments to position our business for the future. You should expect some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we've seen in the past.","We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. In determining next year's expected rate, we have evaluated our projected geographic mix of income, our reserves and some future final determination. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '13 to be in the range of $4.22 to $4.30 or 10% to 12% growth.","Now let's turn last, but not at all least, to cash flow. As you know, we had very strong cash flow at the end of fiscal '12, which reflected an unusually low level of DSOs, 27 days at the end of Q4. We have reflected a more normal level of DSOs in our forecast for fiscal '13, i.e. a few more days. We have also decided to provide a substantial discretionary contribution, $500 million, to our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plan during the first half of fiscal '13. So taking these things into account, for the full fiscal year, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion, property and equipment additions to be $420 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion.","To give you just a little more on our thinking about capital allocation, we are on course to continue our strategy this fiscal year to both invest in our business to grow as well as to return a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. I will share more with you on this topic at our Investor and Analyst Day in 2 weeks.","So in conclusion, we're staying focused on what matters most, driving value for our clients and for our shareholders. We look forward to having some of our business leaders around the world share more details at our Investor and Analyst Day. So KC, let's take some questions.","KC McClure","Thanks, Pam. [Operator Instructions] Doug, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to ask or, I guess, better understand how the bookings will convert to revenue. Pam, I know you mentioned that there's some slower conversion there. Can you just help us better appreciate that, how we can track that? And then, more importantly, just reconcile your bookings guidance with your revenue guidance. Any change again in book-to-bill or any other metric that we should consider?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes. Well, first of all, in the book-to-bill, we were sure pleased with those in Q4, 1:1 in consulting, probably about 1:6 in outsource. So I think one of the things I mentioned, that in consulting, we do see what's being booked be sort of larger, longer-duration things. And those do convert to revenue just as a basket slower because there's less of the little or faster converting stuff in the mix. So we do expect that trend to continue.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So as I think about -- so the -- I guess the correlation between bookings growth and revenue growth, is it fair to say that's going to break down a little bit next year? Because it sounds like it's getting a little bit more complex, I guess.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I mean, I think bookings are lumpy, right, and I think that we did have a number of large things. I mentioned we had 11 clients where we had bookings of over $100 million. So some of those are big things over a longer time period. And so I think it's hard to correlate it exactly just in terms of then trying to sort of link that to a revenue growth rate in the first quarter.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay, fair enough. Maybe just a quick follow-up just in terms of contract profitability and cost containment. No surprise on the margin guidance. But I'm curious, contract profitability has been a big help here. Is there still room to go on that front? Or are there going to be some different levers to pull for margin expansion in fiscal '13?","Pamela J. Craig","Wail, we'll never give up on contract profitability and particularly pricing, and then how we continue to manage our costs and look at the whole value equation for clients. So I think that is -- definitely continues to be a push for us. But at the same time, in terms of managing our business to operating margin, we're going to be looking for those efficiencies in SG&A to continue.","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just on a high level first maybe for Pierre. Your growth rates overall are clearly above industry average and clearly above your peers'. Can you just give us some specific color on some of these 11 large contracts you've won in the sense of what was the driver of you winning that? I mean, your market share gains are noticeable at this point. And maybe some specific examples of what, in an RFP, you showed that others did not. And is that sustainable? And then maybe just to follow up on the similar question to the -- specifically to the Financial Services vertical given the growth, how strong it was there.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, sure. It's excellent, Darrin. Regarding, I mean, what's differentiating us in the marketplace and I think it's reflecting in the 2 illustrations I mentioned previously with Oi and BP. First is our constant focus on large global companies. Second is indeed what we see from a transformation standpoint in the marketplace. And to drive transformation for such large clients, you need to combine multiple capabilities, if you will. And this is what we do with those 2 illustrations from MC technology, BPO, AO. And on top of that, we're bringing things such as the cloud or such as the advanced analytics. So I think we have a unique positioning so far, which is resonating very well with our clients and differentiating us in the marketplace of combining capabilities, operating at scale, working for those very large global organizations and really focusing on bringing an outcome. FS is a good illustration of what's going on. FS, as you know, Financial Services, and especially banking in Financial Services, but it's true for insurance, are industries facing significant transformation from a regulatory standpoint, of course the Solvency II, the Basel III, but as well from an operational standpoint. And again, we are very pleased with what we're doing, especially from an outsourcing standpoint, where outsourcing bookings as well as revenue growth was very good. And it's reflecting again our positioning in supporting those large organization in some major transformations. So that's what's explaining our current differentiation.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In financials, just to be clear, I mean, so regulatory drivers is a major variable as well as just, I mean, overall cost optimization in transformation? Is there any other major drivers we should just keep in mind for that segment just given how strong it's been?","Pamela J. Craig","I mean, those are the major ones. And particularly in banking, frankly, insurance has been strong for us for a number of quarters now. Just one other thing I'd like to just point out because, I mean, these were really strong results in Financial Services, is they did include just a couple of things from a compare perspective that I should point out. First of all, we talked to, last quarter, a little bit about precontract costs. And of course, these are costs that were in the quarter and then the revenues came through in this quarter. So that had maybe only just about a 2-point impact on Financial Services. We also made 2 fairly sizable acquisitions in the beginning of last year, and those had done really well. I mentioned the Credit Services business, which has really come on strong this year.","Operator","Our next question, Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I do -- I'll just say wow in response to your bookings results. And I have a question on the bookings front as well. After the blowout bookings in the August quarter, are you now somewhat needing to replenish your sales pipeline? And should we expect bookings growth to potentially be sort of artificially low in the November quarter after all of the strong bookings that you posted in the August quarter?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, Rod, first of all, I don't know about the word artificially. I think there's always some lumpiness to our bookings. That said, I think what I was pleased about is that the pipeline is still up quite nicely. I think it's only really in the very big deal. We also look at the very big deal pipeline, where we do indeed need to do some replenishment. But that would be pretty normal and natural at this point after that quarter of bookings. We even had a couple, frankly, that came in early, right? We expected them in Q1. They came in, in Q4, which was fantastic. And so there is a little bit of that. And so yes, the bookings in Q1 will be lower, but I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't use the artificially word.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. But you did have some deals that were somewhat pulled forward faster than you normally would occur at this time of the year?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, 1 or 2. Not -- again, that -- it's not like it's some big thing.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then, Pam, can you give us an update on your contracted revenue growth? And then as we look at the growth outlook for consulting versus outsourcing, are you confident that consulting year-over-year growth in constant currency can remain positive for each quarter in the next year?","Pamela J. Craig","I am confident that it will be positive for the first quarter and for the year. And that's, I think, how it will come out. I mean, the first quarter at this point, I see low positive single digits. It could be sort of as low as flattish, but we do see positive. And for the year, low- to mid-single digits positive. In terms of our visibility, we do see, as we look forward over the next 4 quarters, that contracted revenue is up 9% over last year. Interestingly, beyond that, contracted revenue was up 13% more than the prior year as we looked at that. So that just points at this longer-duration thing that's going on with some of the bookings. But the 9% gives us confidence with the 5% to 8% revenue -- projected revenue growth.","Pierre Nanterme","Thanks a lot, Rod. And I had the same reaction like you. I said, \"Wow\" when I saw the 9% in front of our bookings for Q4.","Operator","Our next question is from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Real quickly, just in terms of the headcount build as you think about fiscal 2013, just maybe you can reconcile. The headcount build for the end of the year seems a little bit slower at least versus what we were looking for. I'm trying to reconcile that against, obviously, the record bookings and the record finish to the year here. So just help us think through what is in the pace of the headcount adds relative to the pace of bookings at this point in terms of a little bit -- looks like a little bit of a slower number there.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I didn't necessarily see it as slower. I mean, I think if you look through the quarters of the year, we added 7,000 in the fourth quarter to our billable headcount, and that was more than any other quarter in the year. So, I mean, I think, Julio, I mean, we're doing what we're always doing, right, which is balancing supply and demand. We also have had good results with attrition, right, and that has meant that we haven't had to hire as many people.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And then what about for fiscal '13? What's the kind of gross expectation for adds?","Pamela J. Craig","Probably a little bit less than this year. But again, with the lower attrition, that's the main driver of that and then just again how we see the business shaping up.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it.","Pierre Nanterme","And we're pleased with that if I would add. I mean, if we have lower attrition, it means that we will have less cost for recruiting people.","Operator","Our next question is from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just not to kind of beat a dead horse here, talking about bookings. Pam, do you think that the booking numbers are a function of improving demand, strong competitive wins maybe better execution from Accenture? And then you mentioned pricing briefly. Is that an important lever for you guys in order for you to continue to this very mild expansion in EBIT margins on an annual basis? And maybe you can talk about how you can continue to kind of get that leverage from the pricing.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I mean, I think just one thing I'll point out and then I'm going to let Pierre weigh in as well. I mean, one of the things that I think is interesting is that our sole source wins have been averaging about 60% over the last few quarters. And I think that's up from sort of the 50% that we've been quoting in the past. So I think that our ability to drive really valuable propositions for clients to their specific business needs and shape those things, I mean, I think that, that has certainly helped us. But Pierre, why don't I let you give a little more here?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, and that's exactly right. I mean, those bookings, obviously, are extremely important for us. It reflects that -- how we differentiate in the marketplace. We are winning against the competition, whether what we're selling is resonating with our clients, and I think this is where we are -- and of course, it's giving us the confidence moving forward as we're entering fiscal year '13. So I think what we see is our current positioning is strong in the marketplace with this combination of persistent focus on these large and global clients and bringing this combination of industry expertise together with technology leadership. And then end-to-end services to deliver tangible and measurable values. And today, this is what's the market is expecting from a company like us. And I'm indeed extremely pleased with the booking as the best proof point of our positioning.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then on pricing? Any color there?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes. Pricing, interestingly, remains pretty stable in a competitive environment. And we're always going to be pushing on it where we can.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Are there any specific areas where you think that you do have some of that leverage to bring it higher?","Pamela J. Craig","I mean, I think again, right, where you take a value focus and that's really strong, that's where it makes the most sense because then you're able to really generate the value for the client as well as for us. So that's the focus we try to take with it.","Operator","Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to ask about the Health & Public Service margin. I know it was lower. But it sounded like it was mostly onetime in nature, the write-down, so we shouldn't expect that going forward. Is that right, Pam?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes. It did include some onetime things. We did the delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts and some write-offs we had. So, I mean, that unit, the Public Service piece generally does trend a little lower anyway, but this quarter was impacted by those things.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on the headcount. I mean, net headcount was up about 9% year-over-year. If you hire about the same or a little less in gross adds, the -- lower than the 60,000 you hired this year, then that's going to moderate from the 9% for fiscal year '13. I guess the concern would be then what does that say about fiscal year '14 growth rate if that headcount growth is going to slow? Just maybe you could talk a little bit about that because maybe, there's some -- there's a break there between revenue and headcount that needs to be understood.","Pamela J. Craig","I don't think it really says much at all about FY '14 growth rates at this point. I mean, it's really based on where we need people, attrition and how the business is shaping up for '13. I mean, that's really it at this point.","Pierre Nanterme","No reason to be concerned. I mean, managing headcount is probably, I guess, there are many things we're doing that's right in Accenture, but there is something we're doing very well, which is managing supply-demand, productivity. We have a long experience of doing this. And indeed, it's all the combination of the productivity you expect, the supply-demand country by country, your pricing hypotheses. And you put all of this in our algorithm, if you will, and we believe that we are targeting the right headcount growth we need to deliver to our clients.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great to know because a lot of people look at that as a leading indicator of future growth. So if it does moderate, it doesn't sound like you guys are losing any confidence in the out year number.","Pierre Nanterme","Not at all.","Operator","Our next question is from George Price with BB&T Capital Markets.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Pam, the fiscal 1Q revenue guidance, if I'm looking at the math right, suggests constant currency revenue growth more like in the kind of 3% to 7%-ish kind of range, which is a little bit below the annual range. I guess in light of the macro uncertainty that's out there, particularly in Europe, how should we think about that in relation to the full year guidance? Is this kind of the slower ramp of bookings? Is it the compares? Are there any other factors or assumptions maybe you could talk through?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I think it's both of those and just how the consulting will continue to ramp up and bleed through during the year.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And I know that you talked about returning capital to shareholders. We'll get more at the Analyst Day. I don't know if you can maybe say anymore at this point perhaps qualitatively relative to fiscal '12.","Pamela J. Craig","What do you mean by qualitatively?","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just do you anticipate returning more to shareholders in '13 than '12?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, I will give you more details on it, but I think you could expect it to be more and be consistent.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And would Accenture ever consider levering the balance sheet at all, doing maybe more sizable share repurchase or special dividend, anything like that? I know that, that certainly has not been the thinking of the company thus far. But we've certainly -- with the debt markets the way they are, I've certainly seen more of that. Just curious of your thoughts on that.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I mean, I'm personally not a big fan of that because I think we will always look for ways to put our capital to work. It will be part of our program, of course. We've raised the dividend 20%, which you heard about today. We expect we will do approximately a 2% reduction in the shares outstanding. I mentioned that we're doing the discretionary payment for the benefit plan. And of course, we have an acquisition pipeline. So I mean, these are the things that we think are driving growth in our business and value to shareholders, and we're focused on those.","Operator","Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Pam, I'm wondering if I could just quickly follow up on the bookings conversion question. That's something that you guys have been pretty consistently talking about all year. And I was just curious, do you view that as something as a cyclical outcome? Or is this something that perhaps reflects something more secular?","Pamela J. Craig","I think it reflects some shifting demand patterns in consulting, which ultimately, I think, are good in the sense of sort of this larger, more durable, more value-driven kinds of consulting bookings. And I think it bodes well for the medium term. So I think that's most of it. And I don't know whether that's cyclical or secular or what, but that is a demand pattern that we do see and that we view as very, very positive for us.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And is that something that's pretty consistent through each of the verticals?","Pamela J. Craig","It's different in some ways through the verticals and also around the world. I mean, it does depend on -- and sometimes client by client, right, just depending on what their needs are, how much transformation they need to do. And then in other places, in some of the emerging markets, it's all about building scale for the first time. I mean, so it really does differ, but it's a scene that we do see really moving through the business at this time.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just one question. Typically, in the 10-K, you disclose the annual spend on R&D. Do you happen to have that number for this year yet?","Pamela J. Craig","We do not.","Operator","Our next question is from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","We've been picking up some static and noise that several countries are becoming more protectionist in nature, sort of buy local. I wonder -- particularly India being one of them. I was wondering if that was becoming an issue for you. It seems like I've seen more local companies winning large awards lately and less wins for Accenture and IBM.","Pierre Nanterme","We are extraordinary local. We are French in France, we are American in the U.S. I think we have quite a unique combination of being global by nature. We are leveraging the scale of Accenture in terms of balance sheet, in terms of brand, in terms of finance, in terms of capability. But when it comes to delivering to our clients, we are extraordinary local, operating in more than 120 countries around the world. And we're operating in those countries with local leaders totally rooted in their business community very close to our clients. And that's the way we've been operating for a long time. And I think this is indeed pretty probably unique to our organization, this combination. As you know, we do not have any headquarters. Physically, we are all operating in our different countries. I'm operating from Paris when I'm in Paris. Here we are in New York. So that would be my answer. Now do I really see a trend that clients will turn to more local providers? I don't really see that, and definitely not for our clients, the global companies. Maybe that's something that might happen in other market segments. But if you take the market segment of the G2000, those companies are global by nature, and they are turning to global providers who could deliver [indiscernible] local countries.","Pamela J. Craig","And notably, our revenues in India were up quite nicely, as I believe Pierre pointed out.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. My other question is around sort of -- the sort of a real new tech spending, investing, sort of cutting-edge stuff outside of retail, which really needs to do that. Are you seeing -- what sort of pace are you seeing relative to, say, a year ago as far as the commitment to sort of reach out with some of these new technologies? Or are the transformation deals you're doing sort of more traditional Accenture work?","Pierre Nanterme","I think what's interesting is first, those new technologies, I mean, combining the mobile, cloud, analytics, socials, are growing even faster for a reason than we expected, and we are very pleased with that. That's why I was extremely pleased to report our progress we're making in those new technologies and the fact that now we are operating at scale. The second point we have found very telling is if you take what you're calling more traditional deals, now all those deals, and whatever they are, BPO or big AO, will have a part of those deals in the form of analytics. And this is exactly the 2 illustrations I mentioned with both Oi and BP. You have different component of the traditional solution, if you will, together with elements such as advanced analytics to drive more rapidly to more tangible results and more value. So this is this combination which is now very interesting. And the fact that we could provide what you're calling the traditional services together with infusing those new tech in those deals is, again, I think, differentiating us from the competition.","Operator","Our next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Within Europe, I'm hoping you can talk about what's incorporated into the outlook for 2013 for outsourcing versus consulting. And also, if you could just break down trends that you're seeing within Europe by country.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, so we won't give you that breakdown in the outlook. But let me let Pierre give you some color on Europe, at least.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I'm now the specialist -- ultimate specialist on Europe as long -- anyone could understand what's happening in Europe. But, I mean, first, we are growing in Europe. I mean, you see our results in Q4 but as well in older years. I think the other thing that I'm really pleased with, if you take out Q4, we've been growing in most of the large countries in Europe. I'm thinking about the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain. So when you look at this, we in Accenture are growing in those countries. From a trend standpoint, very pleased with our performance in terms of outsourcing. As you know, most of the European companies are facing large restructurings, and outsourcing is a good way for them to drive that transformation. Of course, we are watching more carefully what's happening in the consulting standpoint. But overall, I'm pleased with where we are in Europe, especially considering the challenges facing by that part of the world.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Are there any markets that are dragging in particular that you'd highlight?","Pamela J. Craig","Interestingly, not really. The ones that showed declines are really small countries.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just one question, 2 parts. First, on the decision-making side. Any change at the small consulting contract level? And then I have just one more.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I think as I mentioned, Joe, the -- we do see a little less of that kind of stuff. So maybe some of those are getting deferred in different parts of the world, and it does differ by part of the world. For example, we see more of that in Europe. And shoot for the second.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And have you seen any change in that or any changes because of the election or anything like that?","Pamela J. Craig","In the U.S., not really, no.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the last one for me. You talked about CMT turning around, I think, in the second half of next year. Maybe you could just talk about what causes that turnaround.","Pamela J. Craig","Well, again, I think we did see -- as I mentioned, we had declines in consulting in CMT. And there's a lot of transformation going on in traditional communications companies. And so we're working closely with them, and that's leading to a lot of outsourcing work. Based on some of the work that's been booked, CMT did have record bookings in Q4. And just sort of the business shaping up, we do see it coming back. We see some interesting system integration work coming back, particularly as it relates to some of these tech trends. And so this is how we see it, that CMT will return to growth during fiscal '13.","Pierre Nanterme","Thanks again for joining us on today's call. As we enter fiscal year '13, I feel confident in the ability of Accenture to continue to drive profitable growth and deliver our business outlook for the year. Our long and enduring relationship with the world's leading companies, together with our global scale and highly diversified portfolio of business position us very well to win in the marketplace and continue to gain market share.

We had a strong first quarter, and I\u2019m very pleased with our results and the continuing momentum in our business. Our revenue growth was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business, including double-digit local currency growth in three of our five operating groups, and in North America and Europe, our two largest geographic regions. I\u2019m particularly pleased with our results in digital-related services, where we delivered very strong revenue growth of more than 20%.","Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered $7.7 billion in new bookings, which were in line with our expectations. We grew revenues 10% in local currency, gaining significant market share. We expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 15.2%. We delivered earnings per share of $1.28 which includes a negative impact of $0.07 from a higher tax rate in the quarter. We generated solid free cash flow of $517 million. And we returned approximately $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend.","So, we hope to have a good start in fiscal year \u201816. And given our strong performance, we have raised our outlook for revenue growth for the full year.","Now, let me handover to David. David, over to you. ","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Happy holidays to all of you. And thank you for taking the time to join us on today\u2019s call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results from the first quarter, especially as it relates to our strong and broad-based top line growth. Our differentiated growth strategy which focuses on five businesses delivered in an industry-relevant context continues to resonate with the market and yield strong value for our clients and our shareholders.","Before I get into the details, let me comment on a few of the highlights this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 10% represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, as we continue to outpace the market and take share. The durability of our growth model is evident in our results with double-digit growth in three of the five operating groups in both Europe and North America.","Digital-related services, continues to be the dominant growth theme as we continue to be a market leader in the rotation to the new. Operating margin of 15.2% reflects 20 basis points of expansion, consistent with our objective to expand margins while investing significantly in our business and our people. Free cash flow came in as expected at just over $500 million and at the same time we returned roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continue to invest at scale in our business, closing four acquisitions in the quarter with invested capital of over 600 million, which represents a great start towards our fiscal \u201816 objective to invest as much as $900 million to a $1 billion to add scale and capabilities in key growth areas.","With that said, let\u2019s now turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $7.7 billion for the quarter, consulting booking for $4.4 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0; outsourcing bookings were $3.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in our first quarter which then built throughout the year. It\u2019s important to note that this level of new bookings represents 9% growth in local currency over last year\u2019s quarter one, with a significant portion expected to convert to revenue in fiscal \u201816.","The highlight of the quarter was strong consulting bookings, which reflect 24% growth in local currency over last year, fueled by demand for digital related services across Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, and Application Services.","Looking forward, we are very pleased with the expansion in our pipeline and expect strong bookings in the second quarter.","Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $8 billion or 1.5% increase in USD, 10% local currency, reflecting a negative 8.5% FX impact, consistent with the assumption we provided in September. Quarter one revenues were roughly $60 million above the upper end of our guided range, primarily driven by stronger than expected consulting revenues. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD and 15% local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 4% USD and an increase of 5% in local currency.","Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter, digital-related services grew over 20% in local currency and fueled strong double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined. Operations in application services came in as expected with high single-digit growth and mid single-digit growth respectively.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology grew 12%, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Growth was broad based and led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets as well as communications, and media and entertainment globally.","Financial Services strong momentum continued with 12% growth, driven by very strong growth in banking and capital markets and in both Europe and the growth markets. Products also delivered broad based growth of 12%, led by our industrial and life sciences industries with continued very strong overall growth in Europe and growth markets.","H&PS grew 8% in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our health industry which again delivered double-digit growth. And additionally, H&PS grew double digits overall in North America including in both health and the public sector.","And finally Resources delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% growth, led by strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. Revenue performance in the energy industry and in the growth markets was challenged this quarter due to industry and country specific cyclical headwinds.","Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32% compared to 32.2% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.9% compared with 11.5% for the first quarter last year, down 60 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.8% compared with 5.6% for the first quarter last year, up 20 basis points.","Operating income was $1.2 billion in the first quarter, reflecting 15.2% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter one last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.1% for the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations and other adjustments to prior year taxes compared to the first quarter of last year. As you know, our quarterly tax rate can vary. And our view of our full year tax rate has not changed, as you will hear when I provide our business outlook in a few minutes.","Net income was $869 million for the first quarter compared with net income of $892 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.28 compared with EPS of $1.29 in the first quarter last year. As I just referenced, there was $0.07 impact to EPS this quarter from the higher tax rate compared to the first quarter last year.","Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry leading. There were 41 days compared to 37 days last quarter and in the first quarter of last year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $517 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $611 million, net of property and equipment additions of $95 million.","Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at November 30th was $3.1 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31st. The current levels reflect, both the cash returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and our investments in acquisitions.","Turning to some other key operational metrics: We ended the quarter with a global headcount of 373,000 people with 270,000 people in our global delivery network. Utilization was 90% compared with last quarter, consistent with last quarter. Attrition was 13%, down 1% from quarter four and consistent with the same period last year.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6.5 million shares for $658 million at an average price of a $100.53 per share. At November 30th, we had approximately $7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share for a total of $721 million. This represented an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the dividend we paid in May.","So in summary, we are off to a very good start in fiscal \u201816; our top-line results and our increased revenue outlook for the year, which I will cover shortly, reflect continued strong momentum in our business.","Now, let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. Our strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October, we provided an update on the actions we have taken and investments we have made to position Accenture to lead in the new, which we define as digital, cloud and security related services, all enabled by new and innovative technology.","In the first quarter, we continued to rapidly overtake our business to the new with digital, cloud and security revenues combined, already approaching 40% of our total revenue. So, the investments we are making in these areas are clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace and driving significant growth.","Let me bring this to life with a few examples. Digital is all about enabling our clients to unleash the power of digital technologies to create new sources of value. We continue to see very strong demand in this area and are leveraging our digital capabilities with clients in nearly every industry around the world.","We are working on a five-year digital transformation with a European aerospace company, bringing our capabilities in mobility, analytics and the Internet of Things to drive productivity improvements.","We are helping a global pharma company, improve its supply chain by leveraging our advanced analytics capability including the Accenture Insights platform, giving patients and doctors access to the diagnostics and medicine they need faster than ever.","Cloud is increasingly becoming a starting point for clients who want to create new services faster and get access to computing capabilities in a more cost effective way. We are working with a leading U.S. energy company to deliver a new operating model, underpinned by the Accenture cloud platform and our hybrid cloud solution. With this new as a service model, the client can leverage our cloud-based data analytics while benefiting from a flexible consumption based pricing structure.","At Accenture, we have a cloud first agenda to help clients move their businesses to the cloud quickly and easily and we continue to invest to build our capabilities. In September, we announced acquisition of Cloud Sherpas and in October we announced a new partnership with Amazon Web Services. The newly formed Amazon AWS Business Group will offer integrated consulting and technology solutions to help clients take advantage of the flexibility of another service model.","Turning to security, in the digital and connected world, security is increasingly important to our clients. We are now leveraging FusionX, a cyber security business we acquired in Q4, in a work with a global high-tech company. We identified gaps in the clients\u2019 differences by simulating a sophisticated cyber attack and we are now working with them to improve their security strategy. And of course we continue to work with clients on large scale mission critical transformation programs. We bring out full range of services in strategy, consulting, digital technology and operations together with our industry expertise to deliver tangible outcomes for clients.","As an example, we are working with a global apparel manufacturer on an enterprise-wide transformation to reduce back office cost by 50% and position the company for growth. As a first step, we are enhancing the efficiency and quality of the client\u2019s finance and accounting processes across 26 countries while significantly reducing cost.","Turning now to the performance of our three geographic regions: In North America I\u2019m very pleased that we again delivered double-digit growth. The 11% increase in revenues was driven by strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we had another great quarter, with 12% revenue growth in local currency driven by double-digit growth in many of our major markets, such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Switzerland as well a high single-digit growth in Germany. And in growth markets, we delivered 6% growth in local currency, led by Japan, the largest company in our growth markets. Japan has delivered eight quarters in a row of double-digit growth. At the same time, we\u2019re carefully monitoring the situation in Australia and Brazil which have been affected by commodity price volatility in the energy and natural resources sectors.","Before I turn it back to David, let me comment on talent and leadership at Accenture. I am extremely pleased that we just promoted the record 723 people to managing director and senior managing director. And I\u2019m particularly pleased that 28% of our new promotes are women. These promotions reflect our commitment to career growth for our people and to developing the talented leaders we need to serve our clients and run Accenture as a world-class business.","So, with the first quarter behind us, I\u2019m pleased with the continued momentum in our business. We\u2019re executing our strategy very well and our rotation to the new combined with our unique ability to deliver end-to-end solutions to clients continues to drive strong demand.","With that I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal \u201816, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $7.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal \u201815 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year \u201816, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal \u201815.","For the full fiscal \u201816, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 6% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal \u201815. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year \u201816 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis points expansion over adjusted fiscal \u201815 results. We continue to expect our effective tax rate -- our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. For earnings per share, we continue to expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal \u201816 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal \u201815 results.","Turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal \u201816, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. We continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases. And now expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s open it up, so that we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Greg, would you please provide instructions for those on the call?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Consulting was a little bit stronger, obviously than I thought, but outsourcing was a little softer, came in -- I think it was 5% constant currency that was down from 9% in the fourth quarter. Just trying to figure out any one-timers or anything going on there in outsourcing and what the outlook is going forward in outsourcing?","David Rowland","Yes, there is nothing -- there is certainly nothing unusual in terms of one-time events. I mean when you pull outsourcing back the -- as a type of work and then related to our business -- our five businesses, a large part of operations, the significant portion of operations is part of the outsourcing type of work and then the application maintenance piece of application services is part of the outsourcing type of work as well. Within operations, the core driver is BPO. And I\u2019ll say, we continue to feel very good about our BPO business. The growth rates have been such that we have continued to take significant share. And if you look at our operations business overall, our expectation for growth remains the same, no different from what I communicated at IA Day where we think our operations business will grow very well in the upper single to low double-digit range, and of course BPO is a key anchor to that.","If you look at the other component of outsourcing which be application maintenance within application services, let me say that for application services, we now see mid single-digit growth. As we\u2019ve talked about, there is kind of two components in application services there is the maintenance of the existing kind of legacy applications for our clients, which is an important function. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there is the investment in new technology and the deployment of new technology.","So, when you look at our services, we see extremely strong growth in the project-based work in application services that work related to deploying and building new technology; that is reflected in our consulting type of work which is why you see consulting type of work growth so strong. What we see is clients are looking to reduce their cost of ownership of their existing applications. So therefore, there is relatively less investment in the maintenance piece in lieu of higher investments in the development piece.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then, when we look at the full year now, the 6% to 9% constant currency guidance, if you spilt that between consulting and outsourcing, what kind of growth ratio we see in both those segments?","David Rowland","Yes. So for consulting for the full year -- I am talking about consulting type of work to be clear, we see low double-digit growth. For outsourcing, we see mid single-digit growth. And then underneath that you\u2019ve got the components of operations and the maintenance piece of services as I described.","Pierre Nanterme","And we are very pleased with that mix.","David Rowland","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Similar question to Bryan\u2019s, I guess just on the outsourcing side with the book-to-bill below one. I heard the answer, but is there simply just a mixed shift going on towards consulting from both your side as well as from the clients? And I am curious, if also you\u2019ve been able to have some tougher comps as you\u2019ve had from large 100 plus million dollar deals earlier in the year; how was the pipeline on bookings as well as; did you give the 100 million plus number of contracts this quarter? Thanks.","David Rowland","I\u2019ll just mention quickly that we had six clients with bookings over a $100 million. Let me just mention a couple of data points and then let Pierre add some commentary as well. We feel very good about our pipeline. And if you think about our pipeline and the type of work view, if you will, we feel good about our pipeline pretty much across the board. And we\u2019ve seen good expansion in our pipeline. We see a lot of market activity, at least from our perspective, and good dialogue with our clients across those consulting and outsourcing.","So, we feel good about our pipeline. Again, we expect that we will see an uptick in bookings in the second quarter and are very encouraged by what we see.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, just to add on this and as well answer to Bryan. I feel extremely comfortable with where we are, with outsourcing and consulting business. The uptick on outsourcing is lower because consulting is doing extremely well and that is why we have the results we are. And it\u2019s all our ability indeed to take advantage of any move or shift of the budget of our clients from indeed outsourcing type of work to consulting investments. And this is exactly the opportunity we are taking to grow. And if you look at our rotation to digital and to the new, the part of the consulting business in this rotation is more important than the outsourcing part of it. So, it\u2019s explaining that consulting is back with a strong growth and we are pleased with the growth we have in outsourcing. So from my standpoint, I have zero concern.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Make sense, consulting was very strong. Just quick follow-up and just the Navitaire timing, and I know always ask about Navitaire, forgive me. But just when should we expect that to come out of the P&L?","David Rowland","Yes, so Tien-Tsin, we can\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t run the risk of predicting the timing. What I can say again is that the deal has already been approved in the U.S. and in Brazil. We have been in the process of cooperating with the European Commission, as they go through their review process. And it will conclude when it concludes. Timing is hard to predict.","Tien-Tsin Huang","So, probably nothing explicit in the guidance?","David Rowland","Yes, right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Koning","Hey guys, nice job. And I guess first of all, just acquisitions have ramped and you\u2019ve talked about how that might contribute I think 1.5% to 2% to res. Is that largely in consulting? Since half of res is consulting, is that maybe benefiting right now by 4% from the acquisitions, while outsourcing isn\u2019t benefiting from acquisitions?","Pierre Nanterme","Answer is yes. Indeed our acquisitions are creating more impact in our revenue growth in consulting compared to outsourcing. So, it is another driver explaining the difference between both businesses.","Dave Koning","And is that maybe -- is maybe 90% of acquisitions, or maybe what\u2019s the mix between how much of those acquisitions are benefiting consulting relative to outsourcing?","David Rowland","I would say if you look currently and in recent quarters, it\u2019s a very high percentage. And of course, it reflects the market opportunity in a way our business is evolving. If you went back let\u2019s say a year, year and a half ago, two years ago, they would have been more outsourcing oriented but it\u2019s a very high percentage. And you are correct to identify that the overall inorganic contribution is in the 2% range and you are correct to identify that the majority of that is reflected in our consulting type of work growth.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, to be clear, the vast majority of our acquisitions contributing to consulting business.","David Rowland","And your 4% is in the right zone, to be clear.","Dave Koning","And just as a follow-up then, revenue per billable employee, that\u2019s been declining a little bit; it\u2019s now probably in the mid single-digit declines on a constant currency basis; so, it\u2019s gotten a little -- I guess you did say worse. But is that really just you significantly ramping hiring kind of in anticipation of what has been and probably continues to be really good growth; is that the right way to think of it or maybe you could just kind of outline what\u2019s happening there?","David Rowland","Yes. Certainly, if you look at the last two quarters, that influence of that metric which I look at obviously as well. So, if you look at it, and let\u2019s say in the recent two quarters, you have the impact that we have very intentionally built bench in key still areas, key growth areas. And you have seen that our utilization, let\u2019s say in quarter one of this year compared to quarter one of last year, was down about a 1% and that reflects that building a bench. And so that does go into that calculation when you look at it all in, as you do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks good morning guys. I am just curious \u2026","Pierre Nanterme","Hi, Jason.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, how are you? ","Pierre Nanterme","Fine.","Jason Kupferberg","So, on the guidance raise for the year, the 1% increase, how much of that is from some of the incremental acquisitions, because I know you did spend a bit there in Q1 versus how much is just kind of pure organic?","David Rowland","Yes, it\u2019s really no change in the incremental acquisitions. We still see about 2% for the year. And you may remember at -- I guess it wasn\u2019t the earnings call but I think it was IA Day, I said it explicitly that the bills that had signed that we anticipated closing in the first quarter which have ultimately closed, we had reflected that in our initial guidance. So, this is -- I mean you could interpret this as an increase in our organic revenue outlook.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, good to hear. And just for a follow-up, I had a question on cash flow. I know it can obviously be lumpy on a quarterly basis, and you did reiterate the full year outlook here, but Q1 at least relative to our model was somewhat light. Maybe you can just remind us as far as timing of bonus payments, which quarter that will fall and was there anything in the cash flow performance this quarter that makes you feel any less confident reiterating the full year target? I mean I looked at on bills, it seemed like those grew a little faster than revenue in the quarter. Was that just timing or anything or any other factors that might cause that dynamic to continue?","David Rowland","Yes. So, one of the factors was the increase in DSO in the first quarter. We had signaled, I think both at IA Day and probably the fourth quarter earnings call that our cash flow guidance allowed for the possibility of on an uptick in DSOs that\u2019s what we have seen.","On one hand, we are very happy with 41 days; on the other hand, we always are working to do better. We have a very cash is king kind of culture. And so, we did have an uptick. That reflects in the first quarter results. And then the second factor that influences -- there are actually three or four factors but the second one what I call -- that I would call out would be the timing of tax cash payments. Those can ebb and flow across the quarters of a year. And that was a factor in the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter of last year, doesn\u2019t change our expectation for the full year. It just means that we had a higher percentage of tax cash payments in the first quarter this year relative to the first quarter last year. Those are really the two drivers of tax cash payments and DSO.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Togut","The digital-related services growth was very strong at 20% plus but down from the 35% you generated in FY15, which was an extraordinary result. Can you give us a little more color on why the magnitude of the slowdown in growth? And in the new guidance you provided today, what is your embedded assumption about digital-related services revenue growth?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. So, I\u2019m going to get the first part of the answer. And I\u2019m delighted with the growth of our digital-related services over 20%; this is exactly the zone where we expect our digital-related services to grow. As you said, fiscal 015 posted some extraordinary growth and beyond our expectations, if you will. And so, we are now planning our investments and the growth of digital-related services to be in that category of growth. And we are very pleased with that. It doesn\u2019t signal any form of slowdown. I mean we\u2019re growing on back of big numbers. If you remember, last year, our digital-related services that do represent $7 billion, what we call in digital and this is where we measure our digital rotation. So, growing double-digit on back of that base is what I would qualify tour de force.","David Rowland","And David, just to add, this is entirely consistent with what we expected and signaled. We see the outlook for digital for the year and continued strong double-digit growth. I think we mentioned again at IA Day that while we were incredibly pleased with the growth in \u201815, it was much higher than we would have expected and it\u2019s higher than it would be prudent to assume, as we plan our year. Having said that, one of the things about our model is the flexibility and our know-how to ramp up resources as we need to if the growth opportunity presents itself strong, even stronger than we expected. So, we\u2019ll see how it plays out. But, if we have digital growth above 20, we\u2019re doing a heck of a job executing our strategy.","Pierre Nanterme","Especially as the vast majority of this growth is organic.","David Rowland","Yes.","David Togut","A quick follow-up, are you able to get differential pricing for digital related services from your clients?","David Rowland","We do see some differentiated -- well, first of all it\u2019s hard to talk about. In that context, it\u2019s hard to talk about digital overall because as you know, we have digital work that we do in Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Technology, meaning app services and operations. I would say, as a general statement, we have favorable economics in digital. And I can assure you, we are always pushing whether it\u2019s digital or any other part of our believe where there is a high value service offering in the marketplace and where we have highly differentiated skills and capabilities that plays in our favor from a pricing standpoint and we try to get the yield from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity. Please go ahead.","Rod Bourgeois","I just wanted to talk a little bit about where your partners are spending their time, because I wonder if some of the variations in growth rates across your business are really a function of where they\u2019re devoting their attention. Right now, you\u2019ve got your growth markets, which currently looks a little bit like misnomer, right? Your growth markets are going at half the rate of the U.S. and Europe and consulting even on an organic basis is growing a lot faster than outsourcing. Is that partly a function of where your partners are spending their time in the pipeline and it\u2019s really -- it wouldn\u2019t be feasible for us to expect you to grow outsourcing and consulting at this sort of double-digit pace, because your partners can only spend their time on certain things in one given quarter?","David Rowland","I think I understand your question. Let me just start with the growth markets, as you characterized it as a misnomer. I think it is important to kind of peel that back, and you\u2019ll understand that growth markets is appropriate when I say this is that we\u2019ve talked about the cyclical challenges in energy and natural resources which is reflected in our resources operating group results. I can tell you that if you look at growth markets, absent the resources operating group, which are attributed to the cyclical challenges that we know and understand in energy and natural resources, the rest of the Accenture business is growing double digits in the growth markets. And so, it\u2019s important to peel that one layer back, so that you can be exposed to the fact that we actually have a very vibrant business in the growth markets.","On the other -- I think the essence of your question is that we have a fixed capacity of partners in the channel. And if they direct their focus to our Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and the development part of application services is a simply a function of if our capacity is focused on one part of our spectrum of our five businesses, does that mean by design that outsourcing goes down. And I would say not necessarily at all. I do think that there\u2019s a lot of activity in the consulting type of work, which is strategy consulting and the development part of app services. There is a lot of market activity and a lot of demand, and I think that\u2019s what the growth reflects. It\u2019s not so much about partners spending time on activity A versus activity B?","Pierre Nanterme","Absolutely, I mean we have clear and differentiated strategies for our three regions. We have clear leaders in the regions, Julie Sweet in North America; Gianfranco Casati in Growth Markets and Jo Deblaere in Europe. They are executing their strategies. So, there is not [indiscernible] or some biased views on this. Indeed in the growth market, the explanation of the growth slowing down compared to prior quarters is all coming from this cyclical impact of energy and natural resources, otherwise we are very pleased.","I mentioned Japan, part of our growth market, again putting a double-digit growth for I think eight quarters now in a row, which is frankly a fabulous result. And we are taking opportunities in each and every market as per our strategy in outsourcing and in consulting. I think we did comment the difference between outsourcing and consulting momentum because of the digital related services nature of the business, which is more around consulting than outsourcing, which is just the demonstration that budget from our clients up a bit moving from this outsourcing type of business to the consulting type of business. And as you see, in Europe, with 12% growth, we are defiantly putting our act together to create our own growth almost against the economic condition of the markets.","David Rowland","Yes. And I want to say again, so it doesn\u2019t get lost. Operations and BPO within operations, we are very pleased with that growth, very good growth and growing above the market taking share. That is a very vibrant business for us.","Rod Bourgeois","And then the follow-up is especially given that your demand today is very weighted towards consulting, do you expect any budget uncertainties as we move into early calendar \u201815? And has your guidance accounted for the potential that the year gets off to a slow start as we\u2019ve seen sometimes in other years, particularly when demand is coming from consulting, the early calendar year budget can be somewhat of an uncertainty. And I just wondered, to what extent that\u2019s accounted for in the guidance?","David Rowland","Well, we have -- of course our range, Rod, is three points to cover scenarios like that on the down side. So, we\u2019ve accounted for it to the extent we have three-point range. We don\u2019t have any evidence of any notable change in client budgets to the worst, which is your question. We don\u2019t have any evidence of that through our channels. And again, our pipeline looks very good, which is indicative of the level of client discussions that are underway currently.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jim Schneider","Relatively to the financials vertical, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little about what you are seeing there, which seems to be stronger than almost all of your peers, which -- some of which seem to be talking about a little bit of downtick in the business. Can you maybe talk about the specific elements or the subareas where you are seeing strength there and particularly, as we head into \u201816 with rate hikes, whether you think your clients are messaging a little bit even more optimistic spending expectations next year than this year?","David Rowland","Your question was about financial services, the financial services operating group, correct?","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s right. Yes.","Pierre Nanterme","Okay. So commenting on FS, I mean we continue to be pleased with the results. I mean we see again double-digit growth in financial services. This is an industry, if you look altogether, which is one of the largest. I think we mentioned at the IA Day that if you put together capital markets and banking would be one of the largest, the largest industry at Accenture. And of course this is an industry historically and currently investing in technology and in transformation. So, we continue to be very pleased with the opportunities offered by financial services. They have to transform. And of course digital-related services are extremely relevant in financial services, almost by definition, it\u2019s a B2C and it\u2019s enabling a lot digital native [ph] technologies to maximize, I mean the connectivity with the clients as well as digitalizing the portions.","This is an industry where historically we made the right investments. I am talking about the investment we made in insurance where we are extremely well-positioned with our software solutions. I am talking about the investments we made in credit services where we are now building a leading independent mortgage processor in the U.S. and very pleased with the momentum we getting in Brazil where we are expanding our services and credit services to again take [indiscernible] position.","We just announced this quarter a very niche but very good acquisition in Boston on asset management called Beacon. I\u2019m very pleased with that adding super deep expertise. So overall, we are very pleased with what we\u2019re doing in FS, which is quite broad-based across the different regions as well, if you look at North America, if you look at especially Europe where we are doing very well, excellent results in growth markets. So, this is the industry where I am coming from and this is one I love the most.","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then as a follow-up, to the earlier question on headcount, billable headcount increased, I think the fastest growth rate we\u2019ve seen in quite a few years. Can you maybe first talk about how much of that is driven by the M&A that closed? And then specifically within this, any specific areas outside of digital where you are seeing a lot of uptick in the headcount growth and I guess more broadly speaking, I assume that says something pretty positive about the outlook you see for the business for the next few quarters?","David Rowland","I mean in the context of the overall Accenture organization, the acquired headcount is just not that -- it\u2019s an important skills that we are acquiring but in the context of the overall headcount, to your question, it\u2019s just not that material. And we see growth in headcount really across our business including by the way in our GDN. You will see in the statistics that a high percentage of the headcount is in our global delivery network. And again I think the theme that underpins it, whether you are talking about strategy consulting, application services or operations, the common theme is this digital rotation and the services and the type of work we are doing in that regard, really is a driver of the skills we are acquiring as a general theme.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman","David, in your prepared remarks, you had called out the timing of bookings to rev rec. I was wondering are there any other operating groups of business dimensions where the revenue recognition is faster than others.","David Rowland","I would say, as a general rule, if you look at Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and the project-based work in Application Services, which is deployment of new tech and let\u2019s just say packaged software even more broadly. The turn to revenue is -- in all of those cases is faster than let\u2019s say the rest of our business that I didn\u2019t call out, and that\u2019s just -- those are just structural differences. And so, when you see such strong growth rates in our consulting type of work business that just reflects bookings that convert to revenue faster than let\u2019s say certainly the typical operations contract would or an application maintenance contract would.","James Friedman","And then, I had a housekeeping question in response to one of your prior answers. I want to make sure I heard this right. When you were mapping the two sides application services between application maintenance, and I think you would describe it as application modernization, did I hear that right that part of it goes towards outsourcing and part of it goes towards consulting in terms of the disclosures?","David Rowland","That is correct. So, application services has what we have traditionally called application outsourcing, which is -- or application maintenance work, that maps to our outsourcing type of work. The rest of application services, which is really about fundamentally development work, application development work whether it be new tech or could be development around existing legacy applications, packaged software deployment et cetera, that is what we would have historically referred to as systems integration. And that maps to the consulting type of work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on just as digital is becoming a bigger part of your business, what the margin profile is for the digital work that you are doing? And is it fair to categorize its bookings realization as a faster rate than the rest of the business?","David Rowland","Yes, we are not going to comment specific -- I mean not in specific terms on margin for each dimension. I think we have said before that the nature of digital, just as a general statement, tends to be high demand. We have unique and differentiated skills and capabilities and arguably, positioning in the marketplace. And all of those things lend itself to better economics. It\u2019s our job to deliver on that, but it certainly creates the right environment for better economics.","Your last question was -- the other part of the question was digital economics\u2026","Joseph Foresi","It was on the bookings; is it a faster realization rate\u2026","David Rowland","There is to the extent that a high percentage of our digital bookings are consulting and consulting has a higher velocity.","Joseph Foresi","And then just as a follow-up, we have heard some commentary in the market of maybe some pricing issues within outsourcing. Has that increased or changed at all as the pricing -- I know it\u2019s always difficult and some of the maintenance stuff, but I am just wondering if you have seen any changes in the market?","David Rowland","Specifically I think you are referring to the application maintenance, application outsourcing piece of application services. What I would say is that there is no doubt that that is -- continues to be a highly competitive market. When we comment on pricing, we comment on pricing in terms of the profit percentage on work that we sell. And in that part of our business, we see stable pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","I was hoping to get a little bit more color around your shift to the new operating units. It\u2019s been I guess 15 months or 18 months now that you\u2019ve started this transition to strategy, consulting, operations and technology with digital, as an overlay. How deeply is that plumped in the organization, I guess either now or you\u2019re planning to, meaning are these truly distinct business units at this point as labor fundable [ph] across them or do the staff sort of reside within a business unit and do they have different investment profiles, pricing models, can you just give a little bit more color around that?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, absolutely. Happy to comment on this, because I truly believe that we are proposing to the marketplace organizing Accenture in a very unique and differentiated way, and I tend to believe that none of our competitors yet could match the capabilities and the organization we\u2019re putting in place. First indeed, we have created five Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations, all at scale, always highly differentiated skills, a very different positioning compared to the competitive environment, different economics. And to your question, indeed they are run as a business with the objective of being top-class in their own categories. But of course where we differentiate in the marketplace is our unique ability to combine our services to deliver what we are calling the end-to-end services, because we truly believe that more and more clients are buying an outcome more than an effort. And if you want to deliver an outcome, you need to contribute and participate to the design and planning, typically done by Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting, the high value services and consulting which you will, then you move in to building solution with absolutely leading and cutting edge solutions, exactly the job of Accenture Digital for digital may continue solutions and Accenture Technology for the leading platform solution or application packages.","And when you have been building solution, you\u2019re moving to Accenture Operations, the part of Accenture where we could operate on behalf of the clients, either their business process; their cloud operation or their security operation. This depth and breadth and kind of operating model is absolutely unique in the marketplace and is a great source of differentiation for Accenture.","And on top of that indeed, Lisa, we\u2019re putting our rotation to the new. Each of the five have a clear mandate to rotate their business to new type of services where Accenture Strategy is going to be being cutting edge in developing digital technologies and creating new business model for clients. Accenture Technology will now unbed [ph] very innovative ways of doing development, what we\u2019re calling liquid, intelligent and connected. Accenture Operations will be extraordinarily analytics rich in the way we are developing operations. And in security with the acquisition of FusionX, we are absolutely top of the game in term of simulating cyber attacks. So, all these architecture we\u2019re putting in place, and I said that with a lot of passion and energy during that call, is indeed unique in the marketplace, Lisa.","David Rowland","Lisa, let me just add to what Pierre said, and address another part of your question. A key component of what Pierre just said is that our talent strategy is aligned with our five businesses. And so, we have talent that is managed, nurtured, developed specific to Accenture Strategy. Those people tend to work, essentially exclusively on Accenture Strategy work. We have people that are identified as Accenture Consulting, developed, nurtured, et cetera. Those people tend to work for the most past, exclusively on consulting work. By the way that includes our client account leads, people who are predominantly deployed to our operating groups that really not only delivers a consulting services but are also the integrator of Accenture capabilities to serve the clients need. We have operations where again we have talent model for operations. Mike Salvino and Debbie Polishook manage that workforce for the most part work, exclusively in operations.","And then you have Accenture Technology. And Accenture Technology is a little bit different. In that, they have a unique talent model, but yet some of those technology people support the development type work, the new tech, some of those people may actually even be part of consulting project delivery. We also have some of those people that at points in time maybe part of our operations project delivery. So, they work a little bit more across the organization. But beyond technology, we also have the innovation labs and things like that. But excluding technology, the other businesses are very specific and fit for purpose in terms of the talent model and the types of projects those people work on for our clients.","Lisa Ellis","As a follow-up, as you are in discussions with your major clients about their budgets for 2016, can you characterize the magnitude of the shift in their budgets from the old to the new, like 5%, 20%, 1%?","Pierre Nanterme","I can\u2019t characterize. I can characterize only the trend is clear that you see a shift from investment in the legacy, if you will, to investment of the new. I tend to believe that the shift is increasing and as reflected, growth in digital related services. Now I don\u2019t have any market data that would characterize the percentage of the shift. There it\u2019s getting bigger and indeed we could take advantage of this shift in term of budget, as reflected with our 20% plus growth in digital related services.","Lisa Ellis","But where you are sitting right now, it feels stronger now than it did at this time last year.","Pierre Nanterme","On balance, yes.","KC McClure","Greg, we have time for one more question and Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Keith Bachman","Hi, many thanks. David, I wanted to go to one area that you mentioned is the growth of your global GDN. Over the last seven quarters, it\u2019s been pretty steady in terms of increasing as a percent of total headcount by almost 1 point a quarter and it\u2019s now just hovering below 73%. Is there a point at which you need to have local presence, it\u2019s an impediment to the total number? In other words, how high can the global GDN go as a percent of your total headcount? Because I would think that\u2019s been a significant contributor to the strong margin performance you\u2019ve had over the last couple of years?","David Rowland","Yes. So, first of all, we still have room to expand our GDN headcount in our model. And certainly, we don\u2019t see that we\u2019ve reached the destination and we wouldn\u2019t go any further. Having said that, one of the things that highly differentiates Accenture is our deep industry expertise and our client account teams that are at the client site each and every day, working shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients. And so the thing about our model is that we have a very strong presence in each of the geographic markets around the world where we operate. That\u2019s a vital part of what is distinctive about Accenture. And then we extend that and complement that with arguably the best technology global delivery network in the world.","To your question, we have the opportunity to take that further, and we will see how the market evolves and then we will respond accordingly.","Keith Bachman","Then maybe I will just quickly submit my follow-up, if I could. The free cash flow guidance for the year, not the quarter but the year, is a little slower than certainly the growth of net income or the EPS context. And I was just wondering, if you could call out some of the puts and takes there. I assume that the days cycle I think is a headwind; in addition it looks like CapEx is a little bit. But could you also address how currency might be impacting the growth of cash flow for the year? And that\u2019s it from me. Thanks very much everybody.","David Rowland","I will just say -- I can\u2019t really do justice to the question, so I will just share a couple of quick points. First of all, the free cash flow guidance is still above 1.0 in terms of free cash flow to net income, so very healthy level of free cash flow. A couple of things that influence that, one is the DSOs; the other is timing of tax cash payments that not only impacts a particular quarter but can be different fiscal year to fiscal year; and the third is CapEx, just to name those three because you call them out. And we do anticipate a higher level of capital spending this year as compared to last year. So that\u2019s in the mix as well.","Pierre Nanterme","Okay, certainly time now to wrap up. And I want to thank you again for joining us today. With our first quarter behind us, clearly we have created strong momentum in our business, especially with investments we\u2019ve made in digital, cloud and security services which we are now calling at Accenture, the new. And that makes me really confident in our ability to continue to successfully grow business and gain market share.","I want to take this opportunity to wish all of you, our investors and analysts and our Accenture people who are hopefully listening to the call, a very happy holiday season and all the best for the New Year. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC. All the best to all of you and the best for the New Year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 Eastern Time today through March 24th.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Katie. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Announcement. As Katie just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call: Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will then take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. Pam will then provide our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2013. And then we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues.","Some of the matters we will discuss in this call are forward-looking, including the business outlook. You should keep in mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and that such statements are not a guarantee of our future performance. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com.","As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today.","We are pleased with our results for the second quarter, which were in line with our expectations. We continue to drive profitable growth and are investing in differentiated services that are clearly resonating with the needs of our clients.","Here are a few highlights. We delivered very strong new bookings of $9.1 billion, including record consulting bookings of $4.4 billion. Revenues were $7.1 billion, up 4% in local currency, including strong local currency revenue growth in outsourcing of 10%. And we were particularly pleased with our double-digit revenue growth in both Financial Services and Health & Public Service.","We delivered earnings per share of $1.65 on a GAAP basis, including the benefit of 2 items that Pam will talk about when she takes you through the numbers. Absent the benefit of these items, earnings per share were $1. We increased operating income and expanded operating margin on those to GAAP and adjusted bases.","We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $5.6 billion. And we continue to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we announced a semi-annual cash dividends of $0.81 per share, which will bring total dividend payments for the year to $1.62 per share, a 20% increase over last year.","So with the first half of the year behind us, I feel good about where we are. And we remain well positioned to meet our outlook for the fiscal year.","Now let me hand over to Pam, who will review the numbers in greater detail. Pam, over to you.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre. And thanks to all of you for listening today. Let me tell you more about Accenture's fiscal '13 second quarter financial results.","Revenue growth was driven by year-over-year strength in 3 of our operating groups, in outsourcing and geographically in the Americas. Profitability in the underlying business was excellent, and we delivered additional margin expansion this quarter. New bookings of over $9 billion reflects strong demand for future business. So delivery was very solid and we are well-positioned for the future.","Now let's go through the numbers. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP, except the items that are not part of the financial statements or that are calculations.","New bookings for the quarter were $9.1 billion, our second-highest level after the record in Q4 last year. Our bookings reflected a flat foreign exchange impact compared with new bookings in the second quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $4.4 billion, and outsourcing bookings were $4.7 billion. Let me give you some bookings details, starting with those record consulting bookings.","In management consulting, bookings were strong in the United States as well as in Asia Pacific and also in parts of Europe. We continue to see client demand for transformational projects in operations, customer relationship management and talent and organization, as well as a pickup in demand for risk management.","Our bookings in technology consulting moderated this quarter, and they primarily reflected projects to drive cost reduction in the data center, network and desktop infrastructures of our clients. We see lots of opportunity ahead and have strengthened our leadership focus on the technology transformation agendas at our clients.","System integration bookings reflected strong continued demand to modernize and upgrade installed ERP systems, as well as an increasing demand for industry-specific systems across the major platforms. Emerging technologies are often part of the mix, as we are doing more and more to help our clients integrate Software as a Service, cloud platforms, mobile applications and digital solutions.","Turning to outsourcing. Our technology outsourcing bookings were very strong in Q2 as our clients continued to seek solutions for driving operational efficiencies and flexible cost-effective sourcing. Our Global Delivery Network continues to be very well positioned to meet the increased demand for such solutions. These bookings reflect strong demand across all 5 of our operating groups and geographically in the Americas and Asia Pacific.","BPO bookings in Q2 reflected continued demand for our cross-industry offerings, especially finance and accounting, and for our industry-specific solutions in communications and banking. Additionally, we had bookings of over $100 million at 14 clients, with all 5 operating groups represented.","So reflecting on bookings overall, we feel good about the strength in demand for our services, particularly given our very strong bookings in 2 of the last 3 quarters. Our improved position in contracted revenue makes our visibility better. This bodes well for revenue growth over the longer term. At the same time, the conversion of consulting bookings to revenue at a slower rate, a trend that began about a year ago, is continuing and is therefore continuing to impact our revenue growth short term.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the second quarter were $7.06 billion, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and in local currency over the same period last year. Our previously guided range of $6.9 billion to $7.15 billion assumed a foreign exchange impact of negative 1%. There was $55 million more in U.S. dollar revenues resulting from a more favorable actual foreign exchange of 0.2% -- negative 0.2%. Our revenues of $7.06 billion were thus slightly below the midpoint of the recalculated range.","Consulting revenues were $3.75 billion, as compared to $3.78 billion last year, flattish as expected, negative 0.5% in local currency growth actually, and rounding to a 1% decline in both U.S. dollars and local currency. We had single-digit local currency growth in the Americas and were down modestly in EMEA and Asia Pacific.","As I just mentioned, the slower conversion of bookings continued this quarter and influenced our consulting revenue growth. That said, we did see good sequential growth on a net revenue per network day basis in consulting in Q2.","Outsourcing revenues were $3.31 billion, an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency, with strong double-digit growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific and modest growth in EMEA. EMEA growth was impacted significantly by the ramp-down of one contract in CMT.","Now let me give you some highlights of revenue growth in our operating groups. Health & Public Service revenues increased 13% in local currency, reflecting very strong growth in health again this quarter, with strengths in both consulting and outsourcing and across the 3 geographic regions. We also had good demand in public service this quarter in both consulting and outsourcing, driven by strong growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific. We continue to reposition the public service business in EMEA.","Financial Services revenues increased 10% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth driven primarily in the Americas across all industry groups, particularly in insurance and in banking. Outsourcing growth in EMEA was also strong in banking and insurance. Consulting revenues grew slightly, driven by strong growth in Asia Pacific across all industries and very significant insurance growth in the Americas. This was partially offset by a consulting decline in EMEA as we continue to see less demand for smaller projects there.","The Products operating group had local currency revenue growth of 6%, driven by strong growth in outsourcing in both technology and BPO in all industry groups and across all 3 geographic regions. Consulting revenues were flat, with puts and takes and strong revenue growth in our pharma\/life sciences industry.","Overall in Products, the Americas grew double digits, EMEA returned to positive growth this quarter and Asia Pacific declined slightly year-over-year.","Resources net revenues decreased 3% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected slight growth overall, with strong growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in the Americas. Consulting revenues decreased in all 3 geographic regions and both industries where we have recently completed a few large ERP programs.  Consulting growth was significant in chemicals, with ERP ramping up.","We are sharpening our strategy to expand our Resources portfolio and our services, particularly in the Americas, and we thus expect that Resources growth in both consulting and outsourcing will be challenged near term.","Communications, Media & Technology revenues decreased 4% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected slight growth, driven by strengths in the Americas. EMEA declined primarily due to the expected significant ramp-down from one contract. Consulting revenues declined in all 3 geographic regions, particularly in Asia Pacific and EMEA where certain clients are reducing or deferring investments due to ongoing economic challenges impacting their businesses. Significant consulting growth in high tech in the Americas continued as clients increased their focus on building capabilities and enhancing their competitiveness.","We continue to anticipate that CMT will return to growth by the end of the fiscal year.","Now let me comment briefly on our geographies. In the Americas, we were very pleased with the performance, particularly the U.S., which posted double-digit growth. EMEA declined very slightly this quarter, less than 1%. Although a handful of countries declined, we are otherwise holding our own in this part of the world, with growth in most of the countries.","Asia Pacific grew less this quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. Q2 included a decline in Japan, which was primarily in CMT, where certain clients in the high tech industry there in particular have significant challenges in their businesses right now.","In summary, our revenue results reflected strengths across many parts of our businesses as well as some areas where we are sharpening our strategy in order to reignite growth.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 31.6% compared with 31.1% for the same period last year, a 50-basis-point increase. This result reflected improved contract profitability, primarily in outsourcing.","Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $834 million or 11.8% of net revenues compared with 11.4% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, reflecting higher costs to replenish our pipeline. General and administrative expense was $456 million or 6.5% of net revenues compared with 6.7% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, a 20-basis-point decrease as we keep driving efficiencies in our cost base as we grow our business.","In addition, we had an unusual positive item this quarter, a $224 million benefit from a reduction in reorganization liabilities that we had established in connection with Accenture's transition to a corporate structure in 2001. This is a noncash item. And at this point, the reorganization liabilities established 12 years ago are almost behind us.","So GAAP operating income was $1.16 billion in the second quarter. Excluding the reorganization item I just mentioned, operating income for the second quarter was $940 million or 13.3% of net revenue, up 20 basis points compared with Q2 last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 0.5% compared with positive 20.5% for the second quarter last year. We had a second unusual noncash item, also with a large positive impact: a $243 million benefit from final determinations related to prior year U.S. federal tax liabilities. Excluding the benefits of this final determination item, as well as the reorganization item, the effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 24.8%.","Net income was $1.19 billion for the second quarter, and it was $714 million for the same quarter last year. Excluding the 2 unusual items just mentioned, net income for the second quarter was $720 million, an increase of 1%.","Diluted earnings per share were $1.65 compared with $0.97 in the second quarter last year. Excluding the 2 unusual items, EPS for the second quarter were $1.","Let me walk down the components of the $0.68 year-over-year increase in EPS. So firstly, without the unusual items, the increase is made up of $0.06 from higher revenue and operating results; $0.01 from higher non-operating income; $0.02 from a lower share count, partially offset by $0.06 from a higher effective tax rate. These net to a $0.03 EPS increase before the 2 unusual positive items, which were $0.34 from final determinations of prior year tax liabilities and $0.31 from a reduction in reorganization liabilities. Together, these 2 unusual items generated an additional $0.65, for a total year-over-year increase in earnings per share of $0.68 in the quarter.","Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continue to be industry-leading in a difficult environment. They were 31 days, down slightly from 32 days last quarter and up from 29 days in Q2 last fiscal year.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $544 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $634 million, net of property and equipment additions of $90 million. Lower free cash flow this year was driven primarily by a lower sequential decrease in DSOs from Q1 to Q2 compared with the same period last year.","Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at February 28 was $5.6 billion compared with $6.6 billion at August 31 last year. The current level reflects the cash returned to shareholders so far through repurchases and dividends, the U.S. pension contribution we funded last quarter and some acquisitions we've made this year.","Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 261,000 people, and we now have approximately 170,000 people in our Global Delivery Network.","In Q2, our utilization was 88%, consistent with Q1. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 11%, consistent with Q1 and down from 12% in Q2 last fiscal year. Lastly, we continue to expect that at least 50,000 people will join our company this year.","Let me wrap up by commenting on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 8.8 million shares for $609 million at an average price of $69.43 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 12.1 million shares for approximately $830 million at an average price of $68.69 per share. At February 28, we had approximately $3.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","Finally, earlier today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared our second semi-annual cash dividend in the amount of $0.81 per share. This dividend will be paid on May 15, 2013. This is in line with the semi-annual dividend of $0.81 per share we paid in November and represents a $0.135 or 20% increase over the dividend we paid in May last year.","Now let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you an update on some exciting things going on in our business, and then I'll finish up with our business outlook.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Pam.","Our highly diverse portfolio of business, combined with our industry expertise and broad technology capabilities, is positioning us very well to see the opportunities in the marketplace. Our clients continue to focus on large-scale transformation, and we are seeing strong demand for our services. This is evident in our excellent new bookings for the quarter as we are helping our clients try tangible and measurable value, particularly in this fast-changing technology environment.","Our latest technology vision report identifies the trends that are having a big impact across different industries and explores how companies can use technology to improve business results. One of these trends is a convergence of social media, mobile computing, analytics and the cloud, which is transforming the way businesses operate. And this is driving demand for our services.","In mobility, we recently helped a leading global pharmaceutical company move sales and service from traditional on-premise delivery channels to the cloud and on to mobile devices for its global sales team of more than 25,000 people.","In analytics and mobility, we are helping a global industrial equipment company design and implement a telematics capability that will allow its customers to monitor their equipment in realtime. Equipment users can now immediately identify parts that need maintenance, which will reduce downtime and increase revenue growth for our client.","And in cloud, we are creating efficiencies and cost savings for a large government agency by developing a private internal cloud for systems that process nearly $100 billion in transactions annually.","Accenture's industry expertise continued to be a key differentiator. And we are driving growth with our unique end-to-end services, which combine our management consulting technology and business process outsourcing capabilities. In addition to providing market-leading services across more than 40 industries, we continue to prioritize our investments around specific industries where we see an opportunity for greater return. 3 of these industries where our focused approach is clearly paying off are insurance, banking and health, which contributed significantly to the strong performance of our Financial Services and Health & Public Service operating groups this quarter.","In insurance, one of our key wins in the quarter, valued at more than $200 million, is to help a leading U.S. property and casualty insurer with a major transformation of its operating model. We are helping the client accelerate growth by reengineering sales across all product lines and channels through one of the largest salesforce.com implementations.","In banking, we are using process automation to help a leading bank in Italy transform its accounts payable and procurement operations. We are using Accenture finance and risk management services to help migrate the client's legacy applications to SAP, streamlining invoice and payable processes and then running them on a managed-service basis. The goal is to deliver a sustained reduction in operational cost of as much as 25%.","In health, a great example is Accenture Clinical Services and the work we are doing for Trinity Health, a leading operator of hospitals in the United States. We are helping Trinity leverage analytics to better coordinate and standardize patient care and improve patient outcomes. In addition to cost savings and safety improvements, Trinity is already realizing many important patient gains, including a reduction in patient mortality from sepsis of almost 20%.","We continue to focus on our growth markets, which as you know, include our priority emerging markets as well as mature under-penetrated markets.","I continue to be extremely pleased with the strong performance of our business in the United States. With double-digit growth, we are gaining market share, and we are benefited from our recent investments in mortgage processes, insurance and life sciences. And of course, we remain focused on operational efficiency to drive profitable growth while applying rigor and discipline across the board to increase our competitiveness and expand our margins through pricing, cost and productivity improvements. This gives us the capacity to reinvest in the business to expand our differentiation in the marketplace.","The overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging, and there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty especially in Europe, Japan and, to some extent, Brazil. We continue to watch this very carefully and to assess any potential impact on our own business so we remain agile and flexible in the way we are deploying our investments around the world. That said, we continue to execute well, again, in our growth strategy, and we continue to focus on gaining market share.","With that, I will turn the call back to Pam, who will provide our business outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal year. Over to you, Pam.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre.","Now let me give you our update on how we expect to land fiscal year '13. As I mentioned in the last 2 quarters, we knew that revenue growth would be lower in the first half of fiscal '13, particularly in consulting. And overall, we are where we thought we'd be after the first half. With our strong bookings positioning us well for the future, we expect the growth will now start to gradually pick up. And as always, we remain focused on driving overall profitable growth in our broad-based global portfolio.","Let's start with our outlook for the next quarter's revenue and then go through the elements of our annual outlook.","For the third quarter of fiscal year '13, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.25 billion to $7.5 billion. This assumes a foreign exchange impact of negative 2.5% compared to the third quarter in fiscal '12.","Turning to the full fiscal year '13. Based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we assume the impact of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to continue to be negative 1% for fiscal '13 compared to fiscal '12.","First, net revenues. Based on how bookings have been converting to revenue this year, we now expect net revenue growth in local currency to land in the lower half of our previous range of 5% to 8%.","Our new bookings, we continue to target to be in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion for the full fiscal year '13 and anticipate that they will trend toward the upper half of the range.","We now expect GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 14.9% to 15% for fiscal '13. Excluding the impact of the reorganization benefit in Q2, we continue to expect the adjusted range to be 14.1% to 14.2%, a 20- to 30-basis-point expansion over fiscal '12.","Tax rate. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%. Excluding the impact from the reorganization and final determination items in Q2, we continue to expect the adjusted range to be 26% to 27% for fiscal '13.","EPS. We now expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.89 to $4.97. Excluding the impact from the Q2 reorganization and final determination items, we continue to expect the adjusted range to be $4.24 to $4.32 or 10% to 12% growth this fiscal year.","Cash flow. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion, with property and equipment additions to be approximately $400 million. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion.","Finally, we remain committed to return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders. In fiscal '13, we continue to target a return of at least $3.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases and to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 2%.","In conclusion, despite the fact that there continue to be mixed signals all over the global economy, we are staying focused on driving the revenue growth we need for the rest of this year.","Before Pierre and I take your questions, there is one other thing I would like to update you on: I have made the decision to turn over the CFO reins to my successor in a few months, effective July 1, and to retire from Accenture at the end of the fiscal year to pursue some new things. It's been a great 34-year run for me, including almost 7 years as CFO. It's a good time for me to do this. This company continues to be well positioned for long-term financial success. My successor, whom Pierre will tell you about in a minute, is fully prepared and ready. The finance team that supports us is first class in every way. And for me, it just feels like it's time. It's that simple. And I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work first with Bill and then with Pierre to share our outlook and how we are doing with all of you every quarter for the past 26.","It's truly been a privilege to be CFO of this great company. And as I look back on my career, I know that it is the people of Accenture and the work we do for clients everyday that makes this company so special. Of course, I will continue to work closely with Pierre and with my successor, whom I know well and trust fully, to ensure a smooth transition.","Pierre?","Pierre Nanterme","Thanks, Pam. And then just let me take this opportunity to thank you for your dedication, for the tremendous contribution you have made to Accenture growth and success. You've always been committed to doing the right thing for our people, for our company, for our clients and for our shareholders. And it has been a real pleasure for me to work with you, especially since becoming CEO. As Chief Financial Officer, you have built a world-class finance organization, and your focus on rigorous financial discipline has contributed to our strong performance over the years.","Of course, a key part of this has been grooming your own successor. And I'm very pleased to announce that David Rowland, who has been a long-standing leader in our finance organization, will become our new CFO on July 1. David has decades of experience at Accenture and a deep understanding of our business. I have known David for many years, and I know that he is absolutely committed to ensuring that we continue to create value for our clients and our shareholders. I am confident that David will be an outstanding CFO. And in true Accenture style, we will have a smooth transition.","With that, let's move to the Q&A. And Pam and I are ready to take your questions on the quarter and our outlook for the year.","KC McClure","Okay, thanks, Pierre. [Operator Instructions] Katie, would you provide instructions for those in the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Pam, congrats on the retirement. And thanks for everything, I -- definitely, we've enjoyed working with you. And congrats to David as well, on the new role. So let me start by asking -- obviously, the bookings were very, very solid. I think you said the bookings are going to track to the higher end against the revenue at the lower end. So is it safe to say that, the primary driver of moving revenue guidance to the low end, is it really just a slower consulting revenue conversion? Is there something else that we should consider there?","Pamela J. Craig","There really isn't. It is that simple, Tien-Tsin, in the sense that the consulting is just ramping more gradually. There's fewer of the smaller deals in there and that converts after, and that trend has continued even beyond where we thought it would. And so that -- and so we do need more bookings, actually. And so we are trending -- and we are indeed trending toward the upper end of the range.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. Now that's encouraging. So just as my follow-up, just a couple of small ones. Just can you help us with the book-to-bill trend? And as we sort of exit this fiscal year going into next, just the directionally, is there something different we should consider, especially in consulting? And then also, just in the second half, for consulting revenue, can we expect a return to positive growth in the third quarter and something higher in the fourth quarter given what you see today?","Pamela J. Craig","So first, on the book-to-bill. Just based on this complexion of the consulting revenue, we are -- we do believe we need to be higher in that range of 1.0 to 1.1 that we've talked about with you for years. So right now, we are looking, and it is, this quarter, 1.1. Of course, if this smaller, shorter-term stuff comes back into the mix in a greater proportion at some point, then it might move around in there, but it -- but you're right, at this point, that's what we see. In terms of the consulting revenue growth rate, I -- we really do think that we will eke out positive consulting growth in Q3 and that it will be, at least, low positive single digits. And that -- it -- trend would continue in Q4.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And Pam, I definitely wish you the best. Very impressive career at Accenture. And you've definitely put together a world-class finance organization. I'm sure everybody there will miss you, and I think that the Street will as well. So thanks again.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Rod.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Sure. And so a question here on the consulting outlook. It sounds like the small deals are still soft. And I'm wondering whether that is purely a function of softness in the market or if there are competitive dynamics that are playing an increased role in being able to win some of the smaller, less-transformational type consulting deals that are out there.","Pamela J. Craig","It does, Rod. To us, it is a market phenomenon. We see it primarily in Europe where we traditionally had, particularly in some operating groups like Financial Services, a lot of that kind of smaller consulting work. And so it's not that it's going down at this point, it's actually staying rather pretty stable. But just as a proportion of the bookings, it is smaller. And we do see it primarily as a market phenomenon more, that clients just don't sort of gravitate to that stuff as much as other things.","Pierre Nanterme","And just to add a color on this. I mean, indeed, just the volume is remaining, for Accenture, stable, and so it's just the proportion we see changing. But we are starting to be encouraged by the healthy pipeline for this type of opportunities. So we're starting to see some things happening. So again, volume stable proportionally with the lower -- it's not shrinking at all, and the pipeline is showing some good signs.","Pamela J. Craig","Particularly in management consulting.","Pierre Nanterme","Correct.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, great. We've had a lull in management consulting, so it's good to see that looking up. So on the bookings side, given the strong bookings in the February quarter, I should ask if duration rose meaningfully on a year-over-year or quarter-to-quarter basis and if you could answer the duration question for both the consulting segment and the outsourcing segment. And then I've got a quick question about the May quarter bookings outlook.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, the duration has stayed pretty stable, Rod, in the sense we were sort of looking at all those metrics: aging, velocity, et cetera. And it's all pretty stable.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. So you had a very strong August quarter 2012 bookings, you had some softness in November because you were seemingly replenishing the pipeline. And then it looks like that pipeline replenishment paid off in February with the stronger bookings. How do we think about the May quarter? Is it -- is the May quarter another quarter of pipeline replenishment? Or are you still seeing deals ripe to be signed with another strong May quarter on the horizon here?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, we do have the pipeline replenishment, and that's been going well during this month. And so I mean, if I just wanted to give you just some sense, I think the bookings will be higher than they were in Q1 and not as great as they were in Q2.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Pam, also, I just want to extend my congratulations and wish you the best. Thanks for everything.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Listen, just want to jump in on the geographic mix. I mean, we saw some weakness in Europe. It looked like Asia was a little bit slower as well. Is there anything we should read into any sort of transition on the segment there or the geographic segment, if it's just really more on the same? Is it timing or anything we should focus on, any weakness developing in that region we should be worried about?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I mean, Asia Pacific, as you know, is a big place. And there's a lot of different things, and I'm going to let Pierre give a little color, but let me just give you some numbers stuff and then do that. But so we have countries that were clearly trying to develop, like China that has a high growth rate, places like India, et cetera, which where the growth is good. Then we have the more mature markets, like Japan, where we did see some isolated decline, which was in CMT, this quarter. And -- but it -- so we have a decent-sized business there, so it had an impact. And then there's places like Australia, which had just phenomenal growth recently, and we do see that coming a little off. So it's sort of the mix yield, next to something, that it is low positive, it's 2%, but I mean, I think, in terms of the positioning for the future, it's shaping up nicely. But let me let Pierre give you some color.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. Just to add on this, I mean, first, we continue to be extremely pleased with what we see in the U.S., and that's very important for Accenture. As you know, United States is our single largest market, so that's very good for us. In Europe, I mean, Europe, you all know the complexity of the macroeconomic environment, and I think we are holding our own quite well. And we have several of our large markets even growing in Q2 in Europe. When you look at APAC, it's a collection of different markets. And indeed, Pam said it very well, we had some very specific situation, I would say, in Japan. And we have this Australian compare as well. But overall, just to add a color on this, we had record bookings this quarter in Asia Pacific, and we maintain a healthy pipeline. So I think -- directionally, I think our geographies are moving in the right direction, of course, with a different pace, reflecting some different, specific situations here and there.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right, that's helpful. So it sounds like it's sort of similar also on timing to where the booking is being strong, but it should catch up also on revenue a little later on.","Pamela J. Craig","That's right, Darrin.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. Then just one quick follow-up. Now on the outsourcing side, I guess there's been a few quarters of deceleration on growth on outsourcing, but it also seems like there's a bit of a shift in terms of consulting obviously being the longer term and as we talked about earlier in Tien-Tsin's question as where the book-to-bill. Are some of the contracts that you used to think will be in outsourcing sort of shifting gears? Are you just positioning them into the consulting side? Or are clients actually moving more elements into more discretionary or more development-type work that are -- that would now be considered something more -- will have more elements of consulting than they used to that previously would have been in the outsourcing area?","Pamela J. Craig","No, I mean, if anything, outsourcing continues to be strong. And it's had 10 quarters or so of double-digit growth. And I mean, we do see that moderating a little bit, but the pipeline is very strong and healthy. And certainly, outsourcing, as a business and an area of demand, continues to evolve very nicely, I mean, what's happening in IT services as it evolves to more managed services. And just the potential and -- in BPO is very strong. We've made some acquisitions there, et cetera. So we feel really good about the outsourcing business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify the guidance for revenue at the lower end of the range. And I guess, let me ask it a different way. What -- is there anything that's actually changed over the last 3 months? Or is it such that nothing's actually changed and the market continues to be soft and you expect it to pick up?","Pamela J. Craig","Sorry. Just ask that one more time, Bryan. I just want to make sure I understand your nuance here.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I just -- I'm curious to know what changed, if you look at it from the last 3 months since you last guided. And maybe nothing changed, the environment remains pretty much the same in consulting and you didn't see the pickup in the revenue or don't expect a pickup in revenue anymore because the market isn't better. I'm just trying to figure out the slight nuance of the lower revenue growth in consulting, what's really causing that or what's different from what you expected originally.","Pamela J. Craig","I think, in terms of what we expected 6 months ago, we did expect that we would turn to growth in the second half in consulting faster than we are. So it's just a little more gradual. And I would say it's similar to how we felt 3 months ago.","Pierre Nanterme","No, I would just confirm: I do not see any change, so let me be clear with that, in any pattern. It's just, indeed, we continue to see the conversion of consulting booking to revenue at a slower rate, something, as Pam mentioned, began about a year ago. We, to some extent, have some expectation that we had an anniversary with -- in this Q2 quarter. And this trend of conversion at a slower rate is continuing, and therefore, it's impacting our revenue growth short term. So what we see is just a more gradual trajectory that we do not see any structural change on anything.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then Pierre, are we seeing an inflection point yet or a bigger appetite for the market to move more to cloud services?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I mean, this trend, I mean, continues, I would say, nicely. Again, I do not see anything I would qualify as dramatic. I'm very pleased with our performance in term of cloud, but I would add mobility as well, everything going digital. All of these is moving at a good pace, is driving a significant growth in those areas for Accenture. Now I do not see a kind of dramatic point of inflection, if you will. I think this market is picking up. It still early days. I think there is more to come in those different businesses in the coming decade. And it's just moving nicely.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then lastly, Pam, can I still call you in retirement and ask you about the FX movements and the impact to the numbers? I'm just kidding Congratulations.","Pamela J. Craig","Absolutely, Bryan. Thank you very much. And also, I just want to point out one thing that -- I sort of got passed a note here, as we were sitting here. It's just in terms of we did point towards the lower half of the guidance in the 5% to 8%. And that really is just because, at this point in time, as we look forward, it just is more clear that it's going to be in the lower half.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Pam, since we have one last chance, can we get your initial view on fiscal '14 right now? No chance?","Pamela J. Craig","There we go. We knew there would be one of you. And if we had taken bets on who it would have been, it probably -- you would have popped at the top of the list, Julio.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. Oh, congratulations [indiscernible]. It's definitely hard to see you leave, but we're looking forward to working with David as well. I guess, just real quickly, I mean, I think most of the questions have been asked around sort of triangulating between bookings and the lower-end number. I guess, maybe just from the way that we think about the model, more bottom-up. If you think about the headcount growth, you -- I think you did say the 50,000 was still in-line, which I guess would suggest, in the back half of the year, you would have to have a pretty big ramp in headcount. Any particular drivers there in terms of where you would expect to see that headcount growth continue to come from?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, it's primarily the Global Delivery Network. And as you know, from the growth that we're seeing there, it's that this has really become a sort of an incredibly diverse group of people around the world that not only do IT and -- but really, we have doctors, we have nurses, we have people doing very sophisticated analytics. So this is -- really, our focus in delivery is really building up that network and then being -- having the right size of workforces locally to combine in with that. So the strategy is the same, but you're going to see more growth in the GDN.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the SI component of the GDN, I know, about a year ago or so when you guys laid out some plans for SI growth on the GDN side, how far along are we there? Is that going to continue its pace as well?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, it's going along as planned.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, just more thematically, one of the sort of, I guess, questions that we typically get around the growth of SaaS, the growth of cloud -- and theoretically, this, coupled with more offshore growth in global delivery, should be having, I guess, a negative effect in the overall size of bookings and bookings awards. But in fact, when you look at the bookings results that you guys are putting together, the numbers are coming in much, much higher but we're not getting it converted as fast. I'm just trying to draw some -- sort of some cross-links between more global delivery and maybe more sort of SaaS- and cloud-based work? I mean, is that stuff just -- does -- is it smaller overall but there could be more duration? I'm just trying to find sort of a link between this concern that this new work is just not going to add as much revenue, but the bookings don't seem to tell that story.","Pierre Nanterme","You're absolutely correct. And I would just like to refer that's why we're very pleased to announce this -- one of our major win this quarter with this leading U.S. property and casualty insurer, more than $200 million, which is going to be one of the largest salesforce.com implementations. So I think that's what that is. We are transforming sales operation. We're not only implementing Software as a Service. And so indeed, even if the strict SI implementation of the Software as a Service might have an impact on the effort overall. As reflected with that illustration, the overall effort to do a salesforce transformation or a sales transformation, even based on salesforce.com, is still representing a significant transformational investment, including SI. So I think that's a good illustration to your question.","Pamela J. Craig","And just as Paul -- and I mean, that's just a great example, right? And as Paul Daugherty, on -- in October, pointed out, it's that, this kind of new work implementing the new technologies, is -- we do see those kinds of projects, at least this large over time, but they are installed a little differently, right? They don't necessarily have these big, giant development ramp-ups and then ramp-down. It's a little more gradual. So I think it sort of plays into this whole trend as well.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Pam.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Thank you, Julio.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The $9 billion in bookings was about $1 billion above what most analysts modeled. So can you talk about whether that was also above your internal expectations and, given the size of upside, talk about some of the areas of strengths whether it be project types or geographies?","Pierre Nanterme","We always have high expectations. So we're extremely pleased with $9 billion, but we're never complacent. So I'm extremely pleased, but I'm not complacent. I mean, we need to drive the business for profitable growth, and this is what we are doing. And it's all starting with bookings. The bookings are our revenues for the future. We're building contracting revenues, what we used, in the past, to call backlog. And but when you look at the areas of strengths, as we mentioned, definitely, I would say that's been the quarter of Financial Services. I'm -- I don't want to always mention my prior operating group, but it was indeed quite of a high mark this quarter around Financial Services, banking, insurance. I mentioned one of our largest sales. But what is interesting is what Pam mentioned: 14 sales over $100 million across all 5 operating groups. So indeed, we can mention Financial Services, they're going to be pleased this quarter. But I think, across the board, we're pleased to refer to -- health's continued to do extremely well. We're very strong in Products from a booking standpoint. So that would be maybe the 3 operating groups I would describe. And then the good bookings in consulting. But this -- those -- these 14 sales over $100 million across the 5 is probably, for me, a great source of satisfaction.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Good. And then as a follow-up: You mentioned several times throughout the call the slower conversion of consulting revenue, and that's been a topic for couple of quarters. Can you talk a little bit more about why this is occurring? Clearly, the [indiscernible] have decided to harness an opportunity. They've signed a deal, they're moving forward, but they're clearly moving through the stages of these transactions or projects slower than expected. Can you talk about why that's happening?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, Katy, let's just break it down a little bit. First of all, I think that it -- there's this -- in the bookings every quarter and the consulting bookings every quarter, there's a mix of things. And so the first thing that's impacting it is in the mix of how the overall set of bookings converts to revenue. When you have less of the lower -- of the smaller stuff that converts fast, then that just works the average, right? And so that's pull it -- and so the higher volume of the bigger and longer stuff is pulling that average up. And then I think, in terms of that work, we do see and -- that things are being arranged not as these sort of giant consulting projects but more in phases and more chunks. And so that, too, I think, just influences how the stuff then bleeds into revenues. So they're the same size, but it's just that buying patterns are overall a slight -- continuing to evolve, and we see that in our portfolio of bookings.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so there's a mix shift in duration, and then with the separate phases of contracts, I guess it's a little more difficult to forecast. Is that right?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes.","Pierre Nanterme","But on the other hand, it's giving us more visibility. So that's an interesting situation where, indeed, this longer duration, which as well is linked to the nature of the programs, which are more transformational by nature. So you need to put transformation with time. There is no transformation you can drive in the short term. That requires some times. So we've seen the duration, which I think is more linked structurally to the nature of the business, which from that direction is good. And it's definitely given us more visibility in our business and more backlog moving forward. So we need to get through this transition, if you will, in term of pace of short-term growth. And as I mentioned, we'll -- in the back end of the year, we expect to see consulting growth in the single digit, as mentioned by Pam.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Congrats on the retirement, Pam.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Katy.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Pam, let me add my congratulations as well, and all the best for the future. And David, welcome. So in the risk of flogging a dead horse here, I just want to go back one more time to the small versus large contracts and the dichotomy there. Could you provide us some idea of maybe how important are small versus large in terms of magnitude, in terms of the contracts? Is it 15% of the total, 20% of the total? Is there any particular focus on specific verticals? And I think, competitively, as well the question was asked before, is it -- that, in the large contracts, you maybe see more of IBM, but in the smaller ones, you might see the Indian guys. Any information there?","Pamela J. Craig","Well, I'll comment on the -- you say, what industries. I mean, it is in Europe. And historically, some of our businesses did have higher proportions of these in their mix of bookings. And particularly in Europe, and I mentioned Financial Services, they had a high proportion of those. So there is some of that. And again, when you think about the transformation that's happening in Europe, in banking and that sort of thing, this all just makes sense in terms that those buying patterns would change. So I can at least give you that much. I mean, we're not -- we don't give out the numbers in terms of how these things proportionally. But just as a proportion of the total bookings, they're stable, but our lower-proportion because bookings are up.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. And with regards to EMEA, you're -- which countries in EMEA? Is it the, let's say, the normal suspects? I guess, Benelux, weak for a while; and maybe France weakening here. Are those the countries that Pierre sort of mentioned as weak?","Pierre Nanterme","I -- so as you're mentioning France, I'm almost taking that as a personal attack, so I have to respond, of course, on this. And I'm extremely pleased, delighted, to communicate that France is back with some growth in Q2. But more seriously, indeed, when you consider the overall macroeconomic situation in Europe, and we all know, I mean, the challenges in term of economic recession, in most of the part, plus all the Cyprus and other things happening almost everyday, it's very encouraging for us to see that countries such as Germany -- and I'm going to mention the kind of big one, big practices: Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, France, Spain...","Pamela J. Craig","Spain did not, but all the other...","Pierre Nanterme","Spain did not. France -- Germany, Italy and France.","Pamela J. Craig","Switzerland, Ireland, South Africa, yes.","Pierre Nanterme","Switzerland, Ireland, South Africa is a little bit more than Europe, but -- EMEA, anyway, are indeed growing. And if you put that in the context of the overall macroeconomic environment in Europe, I think that's a good signal.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Pam.","Pamela J. Craig","Thanks, David.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just shifting gears. If you could give us some insight into pricing across your range of services and maybe drill down into consulting and outsourcing and then contrast that to the wage increases you're paying in your major practices.","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, overall, pricing is stable -- I might say, maybe -- I will say, stable plus. I mean, you will characterize the plus, but I think it's slightly more than stable. But overall, it's stable. We used to say, with pockets of pricing power, if you will. But I'm feeling comfortable with our pricing situation, and I would characterize into pricing plus. I don't know whether we can give more details, Pam on...","Pamela J. Craig","No, I mean, that's exactly right. I mean, when you look at the contract margins that are up, particularly in outsourcing, as it was reflected in our gross margin, I mean, part of that is pricing, right, that we're able to get that. Now we don't -- I mean, it's -- we're characterizing it as stable overall because, as you can imagine, across this giant business of all these things, it's -- there are some puts and takes. But I think stable plus is a good way to characterize it.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","You mentioned contract margins were up in outsourcing, but you didn't specifically address consulting. Can you provide some insights into that business?","Pamela J. Craig","They were up as well but just not as much, yes. So it's a little more marginal. It just wasn't -- but they were certainly not down.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just finally, on wage trends across the business.","Pamela J. Craig","Well, as you know, we put in our salary increases primarily September 1. And we do adjust those during the year if we need to, but we're just starting the planning, actually, for what we'll be doing next year.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. But if you reflect on what we did that year, I think we did a good job in setting the wages at the right place; in absorbing reasonably rapidly in Q1, in the first half of the year, as reflected as well in the margins. So it's what we continue to have, Pam and I, what we call rigor and discipline. I'm called Mr. R&D in Accenture. I would expect that would be Mr. Research and Development, but it's more resources, more rigor and discipline. But I think we are -- we know how to manage our cost. And it's very important: In such a competitive environment, we need to be competitive. So we will never give up in our competitiveness, and we will continue to invest in our differentiation.","Thanks a lot, David. And thanks, all of you, for joining us on the call today. Now as you heard, this call today was somewhat special for Accenture, but it will be an special for me as well, with Pam announcement.","Now coming back to the business, and in closing, I'm pleased overall with where we are. And as we said, at a time where economic volatility and uncertainty are still prevalent, we continue to manage our business with a permanent focus on driving profitable growth. We are leveraging our global footprint and our unique end-to-end transformational capabilities to provide highly relevant business solutions to our clients. We are investing in our future, and we remain totally committed to delivering value for our clients and shareholders. And finally, with 261,000 highly qualified and highly dedicated men and women around the world, frankly, I feel confident in the ability of Accenture to continue to win in the marketplace.","We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. And in the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC.

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Ms. KC McClure. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings announcement. As Tom just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. David will then provide our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2014, and then we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.","As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues.","Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, including the business outlook.

As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our results for the first quarter, which were in line with our expectations. We again delivered profitable growth and returned substantial cash to our shareholders. I'm particularly pleased with our new bookings, which demonstrate that we continue to provide differentiated and highly relevant services to our clients and which position us well for the rest of the fiscal year.","Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We did a good, very strong new bookings of $8.7 billion, including consulting bookings of more than $4 billion. We generated revenues of $7.4 billion, a 3% increase in local currency and at the top of our guided range. We delivered earnings per share of $1.15, an 8% increase. We expanded operating margin 30 basis points to 14.8%.","We generated free cash flow of $122 million, and we continued to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4.5 billion. And we continue to return substantial cash to shareholders through a significant increase in our share repurchases this quarter versus Q1 last year and the payment of a semi-annual dividend of $0.93 per share, which is a 15% increase over our prior dividend. So we are off to a good start in fiscal year '14 with our business developing in a way that makes us confident in our ability to deliver our business outlook for the year.","Now let me hand over to David, who will review the numbers in greater detail. David?","David P. Rowland","Thank you. Thank you, Pierre. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for joining us today. As I review the results on this morning's call, you'll see that we delivered very good results in quarter 1 as compared to the business outlook that we provided for both the quarter and the full fiscal year. Our results continue to reflect good profitability and cash flow, and our result -- and our revenues landed at the top end of our guided range for the quarter with signs of positive momentum in several areas of our business. So overall, I was pleased with our quarter 1 results, which came in as expected and represent a solid start to the new fiscal year.","Now let's get to the numbers, starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were $8.7 billion, the third highest quarter on record as we saw strong demand for our services across many dimensions of our business. Consulting bookings were stronger than expected at $4.3 billion with a book to bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were very good as well at $4.4 billion, following a very strong quarter 4 with a book to bill of 1.3.","Taking a closer look at our new bookings, there are several additional points worth noting. Consulting bookings were the second highest quarter on record and exceeded $4 billion for the first time since quarter 2 fiscal '13, reflecting good demand across the 3 components of our consulting business. In particular, systems integration bookings were the strongest in 3 quarters, reflecting double-digit sequential growth and a book to bill at the upper end of our target range.","Outsourcing bookings reflected good demand in technology outsourcing with strong sequential growth and a book to bill of 1.3. BPO bookings were solid this quarter, following very strong bookings in quarter 4, and the overall demand environment remains robust. Bookings in Financial Services and H&PS both reflected double-digit sequential growth, providing a solid foundation for the remainder of the year. And lastly, we continued to see strong demand for helping our clients tackle their largest, most complex projects, resulting in 13 clients with bookings over $100 million.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.4 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency, reflecting negative 1% FX impact as compared to the approximately negative 2% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for FX, we were at the top end of our guided range for the quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.9 billion, down 1% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.4 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars and down (sic) [up] 6% in local currency.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, the results were also very consistent with our expectations. So let me share some of the highlights. Products in H&PS led the way with both operating groups posting 6% growth. Products, our largest operating group, continued their track record of driving a very consistent level of growth, and once again, the results were characterized by broad-based growth across the dimensions of the business, meaning they delivered positive growth in both consulting and outsourcing in all 3 geographic areas and in the majority of industry segments.","As expected, H&PS did see some moderation following 9 straight quarters of double-digit growth. Our Health business grew double digits driven by the Americas. Public service growth was also positive for the quarter with very strong growth in the Americas offset by a decline in EMEA. For H&PS overall, we expect some further moderation in the growth in the second quarter before building in the second half of the year.","Financial Services grew 3% in local currency, very consistent with what I signaled last quarter. The transformational agenda continues to be a central theme with our clients, which fueled strong outsourcing growth in the quarter across most industries and geographic areas, offset by a modest decline in consulting. Also, it's important to note that we saw overall positive momentum in both EMEA and Asia Pacific with low single-digit growth in EMEA and very significant double-digit growth in Asia Pacific.","Resources showed improvement with 1% local currency growth as the business continues to stabilize and position itself for positive growth this year. We continue to focus on repositioning the business in North America and EMEA. That said, we're seeing pockets of strength emerging in certain areas of our resources business, most notably in both our global energy business and Asia Pacific.","CMT posted negative 2% growth in the quarter, but we continue to feel good about the actions underway to position the business for sustained, positive growth this year. Our efforts to diversify our CMT business are taking hold, and we see strong demand for transformation-led, value-driven projects where we are uniquely positioned. We continue to be pleased with our progress in the Americas, including very significant growth in electronics and high tech.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.3% compared with 32.8% for the same period last year, up approximately 50 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 12.6% in net revenues compared with 12% of net revenues for the first quarter last year, up approximately 60 basis points.","General and administrative expense was 6.1% of net revenues compared with 6.2% of net revenues for the first quarter last year. Operating income was $1.1 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 14.8% operating margin compared with 14.5% for the same period last year. This 30-basis-point increase reflects a benefit of approximately 20 basis points from a reduction and reorganization liabilities.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1% compared with 26.8% for the first quarter last year. Net income was $812 million for the first quarter, and it was $766 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 6%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.15 compared with $1.06 in the first quarter last year, an increase of $0.09.","Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding continue to be industry leading. They were 34 days, up from 31 days last quarter.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $181 million, net of property and equipment additions of $59 million.","Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at November 30 was $4.5 billion compared with $5.6 billion at August 31 last year and reflects our share repurchases this quarter in addition to the higher dividends we paid in November.","Moving to some other operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 281,000 people, and we now have approximately 186,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In quarter 1, our utilization was 87% compared with 88% in quarter 4 last year. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 11%, down from quarter 4 and in line with quarter 1 last year. Lastly, we now expect that at least 60,000 people will join our company in fiscal '14.","As it relates to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 9.7 million shares for $722 million at an average price of $74.27 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $6.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.93 per share for a total of $630 million. This represented a $0.12 or 15% increase over the dividend we paid in May.","So in summary, in a market that offered many opportunities but also many challenges, our results came in as expected and gave us a good foundation to build on as we progressed throughout the year.","With that, let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. At our investor and analyst conference in October, I shared with many of you how we are investing across the board to further differentiate Accenture and capture new ways of growth. Today, I'm going to provide a brief update on some of the steps we are taking to drive further innovation and to continue to build differentiated capabilities and solutions for our clients.","Earlier this month, we launched 2 new growth platforms: Accenture Digital and Accenture Strategy. We continue to invest in strategic acquisitions to enhance our capabilities in key growth areas, and we remain focused on positioning Accenture as the partner of choice for large-scale transformation. Let me bring this to life with a bit more detail.","Starting with Accenture Digital. Over the last few years, we have made significant investments in building our digital capabilities through Accenture Interactive, Accenture Analytics and Accenture Mobility. With Accenture Digital, we are bringing all of these together to create what we believe is the world's largest end-to-end digital capability.","Accenture Digital includes 23,000 professionals working across the entire digital landscape, including developing, implementing and running digital solutions. It leverages the breadth and scale of Accenture's cloud, systems integration and enterprise application capabilities, as well as our Global Delivery Network. Combined with our industry expertise and broad local footprint, we are very well positioned to help clients transform their businesses to compete in a digital world.","For Unilever, we built a digital social platform in 12 weeks to connect its marketers, brand managers and partners in 190 countries. We helped BT Sport reach millions of broadband customers by delivering their end-to-end video solution that spans live streaming video-on-demand mobile apps and cloud services. And for a leading European automaker, we are leveraging our mobility capabilities and our connected vehicle business service to bring customers new innovations inside their cars from real-time traffic information to voice-controlled entertainment.","We also launched Accenture Strategy, a unique capability focused on strategy at the intersection of business, technology and operations. This new growth platform is all about helping C-suite executives shape and execute their transformation agendas, focusing on issues relative to growth and innovation, industry convergence, geographic expansion and enterprise transformation. In short, we helped them define and implement industry-specific strategies that are enabled by technology. This is our sweet spot, and we truly believe Accenture Strategy will be highly differentiated capability in the marketplace.","For example, we are helping a global consumer products company increase its competitiveness and reestablish its leadership position across key product categories. Leveraging our strategy, technology and industry-specific operations expertise, we are helping the company deliver more than $1 billion in bottom line impact.","At the same time, we continue to invest in strategic acquisitions to further differentiate our capabilities in key growth areas. Earlier this month, we finalized the acquisition of Procurian, making Accenture the clear leader in procurement BPO. The combination of Procurian's strategic sourcing expertise and our industry expertise will significantly enhance Accenture's end-to-end sourcing and procurement capabilities.","We also continue to invest in differentiated industry-based business services. In manufacturing, we are expanding our product life cycle management services through the acquisition of PRION Group and PCO Innovation, which will enhance our ability to help automotive and industry equipment companies deliver products more quickly and efficiently.","And finally, we remain the partner of choice for our clients' large-scale transformation programs. We continue to see strong demand for this type of work as demonstrated by our 13 bookings over $100 million in Q1, which David mentioned.","We have a long-standing relationship with Dow Chemical and are now helping Dow with 1 of their most strategic transformation initiatives, positioning the company for cost savings and value creation of about $2.5 billion over 5 years. And we helped Ducati, the Italian motorcycle company, transform the way it interacts with dealers and customers. The new global dealer communication system is accessible through mobile devices across 88 countries, helping Ducati analyze sales and services activity to respond in real-time to customer demands.","Now let me turn to the geographic dimension of our business. In the Americas, we grew even 4% in local currency with high single-digit growth in the United States, which is our largest market. However, we are facing challenges in both Brazil and Canada. In EMEA, revenues were up 1% in local currency, driven by growth in Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. And in Asia Pacific, we grew revenues 5% in local currency driven primarily by growth in Australia, ASEAN and Japan. That is the strongest growth we have had in Asia Pacific since the first quarter last year.","In a global economic environment that is characterized as more or less sluggish, we are managing our business with discipline to increase our competitiveness while continuing to invest to drive further differentiation. I feel confident that we are well positioned to drive more growth in the second half of the year where we will benefit from the return on our investments in launching new growth platforms, building new business services and acquiring new capabilities.","With that, I will turn it back to David, who will provide our business outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year.","David P. Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Before I get into the business outlook, I was told that I may have misspoken on a key metric, so let me just clarify that right now. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.4 billion. They were up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 6% in local currency.","So let me now just turn to the business outlook, and let me start by providing some brief context for how we see the remainder of the year before I get into the numbers. From a revenue standpoint, as we've said, the first half of the year is shaping up very consistent with our -- with the expectations we had when we provided our initial business outlook. At the same time, we're seeing signs of momentum in certain areas of our business, and that is reflected in our strong quarter 1 bookings, as well as a very healthy pipeline as we move into the second quarter. Given that, as Pierre said, we're even more encouraged about our ability to drop higher growth rates in the second half of the year.","So let's now turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal '14, we expect revenues to be in the range of $6.95 billion to $7.25 billion. This assumes a foreign exchange impact of approximately negative 1.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '13. For the full fiscal year '14, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to be negative 0.5% compared to fiscal '13.","For the full fiscal '14, we continue to expect net revenue to be in the range of 2% to 6% growth in local currency over fiscal '13. For the full fiscal year '14, we continue to expect new bookings to be in the range of $32 billion to $35 billion. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal '14 to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, a 10- to 30-basis-point expansion over adjusted fiscal '13 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%. For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '14 to be in the range of $4.44 to $4.56, or 5% to 8% growth over adjusted fiscal '13 results.","Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '14, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $400 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning the substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, David. [Operator Instructions] Tom, would you provide instructions for those on the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Bryan Keane representing Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to ask about consulting. What can we expect for second quarter '13? I guess it came in about flat in revenue in the first quarter. It was about as expected. Should it be another flat? Or should we see a little bit of improvement as we move into 2Q? And then I assume the back half of the year gets a little stronger in consulting. Just looking for some color.","David P. Rowland","Yes. If you just -- in terms of time to the overall range that we gave, we think consulting could be flat to low single digit positive. We are encouraged by the bookings that we saw in the first quarter. We're also encouraged by the pipeline that we see going forward in our business but in the second quarter, flat to low single digit positive. And we see the potential for building momentum in consulting as we go through the year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up. I guess, I saw you guys increase headcount, just your thoughts around that. And then secondly, on SI bookings year-over-year, is there a growth rate we can think about? I know sequentially, they were up double digits, but I'm just kind of curious how they're trending year-over-year.","David P. Rowland","Yes. The headcount, frankly, just reflects -- we're 90 days further into the year. We're that much further with our supply-demand management, our recruiting, planning. We certainly have the visibility of the bookings that we just had in quarter 1. So it really just reflects we're further up the curve, if you will, within the year in terms of our supply-demand management. So that's why we increased the number to at least 60,000 to give you the best possible view of how we see it at this point in time. The SI bookings, I did anchor to the sequential growth, really, to -- because I was trying to give you an indication of current momentum. I actually don't have the number in front of me, but I believe the year-over-year growth in SI was healthy as well.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line on Tien-tsin Huang representing JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just similar questions to what just Bryan just asked. Just on the consulting front, it's the first time we've seen book to bill in the first quarter sequentially in quite a while, looks like since '09, if I'm right. So I guess my question here is, is the timing of bookings conversion, has it changed at all in terms of what you've observed in the last several quarters because it sounds like second quarter should be at least flat based on your prior answer? Just trying to gauge what that could -- how that could fill out the rest of the year based on the book to bill.","David P. Rowland","Yes, I don't know so much, Tien-tsin, about the timing point. As much as it is, I think last quarter, I mentioned that we felt good about our consulting pipeline, but it was a little bit less mature. And what we had in the first quarter was we were just very successful moving deals at pace through the pipeline and getting work contracted. But it does -- it was broad-based improvement when you look across the 3 components of consulting that we talked about. We were particularly pleased with the consulting activity -- bookings activity in North America, but within North America, we saw good activity across most of our industry segments. And so it was fairly broad based in that sense, both in terms of the type of consulting work that we do, as well as the North America where we saw the strength across many of our industry segments.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, good. And then in just in systems integration, you said the bookings were strong. But can you be a little more specific? I mean, what type of integration work is being demanded? I know that this is a hot topic, obviously.","David P. Rowland","Yes. I don't know that I could characterize a common theme if you look to the bookings. It's the mix as you would expect. I think it crosses the platform of services that we provide. Certainly, you -- we also have in there situations where we have application maintenance type contracts where we are also doing development work, new development work within those longer-term contracts that would be in the mix as well. And certainly, digital would be a component of that as well as we continue to be very encouraged by the activity that we see in the digital space and how our capabilities are lining up against those opportunities with our clients.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of David Grossman with Stifel.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if I could just kind of follow on to Tien-tsin's question. I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of speculation about how tightly your growth is correlated with some traditional lines of business, like ERP license growth. And I'm wondering just how much work really remains in the installed base independent of license growth and how does the migration of the ERP [ph] vendors, as well as how these other cloud-based applications impact your model.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. I mean, I will take this one and I mean, provide a context of this question, especially around ERP. And let's start with the question around ERP. I mean, first, ERP remains an important part of our business, and it's still an important part of the bookings David alluded to. We are still selling, implementing ERP. And by ERP, I mean mainly finance and accounting application solution, human resources application solution and supply chain application solution. I think this is definition given to the core ERP business. As you know, there've been very significant ERP program 2 or 3 years ago where all the giants been investing and creating their backbone solution to organize their operations, especially on a global basis. These last couple of years, there have been a cycle of lower growth in ERP, but it's still a good business for Accenture. That being said, the vast majority of what we do at Accenture is not falling in that category of application packages, if you will, around finance and accounting, HR and supply chain. We have a much more diverse portfolio of business. David is mentioning digital, where we're enjoying double-digit growth in that category of our business. I'm thinking, of course, about the BPO. I'm thinking about all the -- which is not system integration, of course, about digital. I'm thinking about all the custom solution we're still developing with some clients. And as you know, there are industries out there which are not so much ERP heavy but more custom-made heavy. I'm thinking about financial services. If you take banking and insurance, the core banking system and the core insurance system are still more custom made or packaged but are not ERP per se in the definition of ERP. If you take communication, media and technology, all what we're calling the OSS, the BSS, the system, the billing system, the customer systems are not ERP related in the strict sense of the definition, and we're doing a lot of this as well. So ERP, important at Accenture but not at all the vast majority of what we do. So we are not that dependent on ERP as you might imagine.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Very good. That's helpful. And if I could just ask a little bit about the flow of the year, I mean, obviously, we've gotten off to a very good start in bookings, but the guidance, as I think you mentioned your prepared remarks still remains back-end loaded, if you will, on the revenue side. Can you help us better understand what are the dynamics that give you that confidence that revenue growth does accelerate in the back half of the year?","David P. Rowland","Yes, there's -- I mean, there are several things that we look at. First of all, as you said, the strong bookings in the first quarter give us a great foundation to build on as we move forward. The second thing is that we do feel very good about our pipeline and how it is shaped up during the quarter even with the very high bookings we had. And we see the opportunity for another good bookings quarter in the second quarter. But beyond that, there's really 3 things that I think I would point to that give us confidence in building growth. The first is that you've heard us talk quite a bit over the last several quarters about our success in selling large-scale transformation programs. We've been very transparent with those numbers each quarter. For example, this quarter, I said we had 13 deals over $100 million. Well, we can now see specific instances, specific contracts where those contracts are building to generate meaningful sources of incremental revenue as we turn the page to the second half of the year. So one element of our confidence ties to the uptick in those large transformation programs starting to impact revenue. The second thing is the investments that you've heard us talk about in creating these new business services, these end-to-end solutions from consulting to BPO such as Accenture post-trade services where we announced the pilot deal, I think it would have been in the fourth quarter of last year. I think I specifically commented at a point that the interesting thing about that opportunity, one of the interesting things was that the revenue ramp occurred after we had been in the program for several months. And so that's another example where some of these new business services, we believe, will start to drive incremental revenue as we turn the page to the second half of the year. And then of course, the third thing would be the investments that we have made in acquisitions as an engine for organic growth. And so Procurian is the one that is the most noteworthy that we closed earlier this month. And so if you look at how -- take Procurian as an example and as we fold that into our Accenture BPO business and we look at the revenue accretion that we'll get from that, that is our third source of confidence as we look at the back half of the year. And so we look at those things in combination, and that, again, gives us reason to be optimistic in terms of our revenue trajectory as we move past the second quarter into the back half. Hopefully, that's helpful.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So you posted 3% revenue growth in constant currency in the quarter, and your Q2 guidance implies revenue growth in constant currency. It may not show acceleration, and clearly, your fiscal year guidance implies that acceleration is in the cards. Is your February quarter guidance embedding an extra layer of conservatism due to uncertainty about clients' upcoming budget decisions in the new calendar year? Or are you seeing certain parts of the business that will show added struggle in the February quarter? You had a little bit of that in the November quarter where a couple of the verticals took a step back because of timing. Do you have any of that going on in the February quarter? Or is this just, say, you're being careful with guidance as the new calendar year turns the corner?","David P. Rowland","Rod, thanks for the question. The upper end of our range is 4%. If you were to take it out a decimal, maybe a 4 point x percent growth. And so the upper end of the range does show momentum over the 3% that we just delivered this quarter. And of course, our range is established to reflect the possibilities of what could happen in the quarter, but we work very hard to try to drive the business as high in the range as we possibly can. There are a number of things about the second quarter that are just structural aspects of the second quarter. You have holidays in there around the world, including the New Year holiday. You do have the page turn to the calendar year, which you alluded to, and we don't have any particular concerns about client budgets based on what we see now. We don't have any evidence that client budgets would be under pressure per se. But we have seen years where even if the client budgets are expanding in a year, you can have some slower ramp-up in certain instances. We've seen that in the month of January. And so the second quarter is always a more tricky quarter to predict revenue momentum. And so I think the guidance reflects some of that as well. But again, the guidance that we provided is consistent with how we really saw the year building up in the first half of the year, and it's pretty much as we expected and very much in line when we communicated our original guidance 90 days ago.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. And just the follow-up us to that is, can you quantify how much sequential revenue growth you'll get in Q2 from new acquisitions, particularly the ones that you've done since your last earnings report? How much sequential and year-over-year revenue growth do you expect in the February quarter? And it would be helpful then to see if the -- if your guidance implies revenue growth acceleration at the upper end even after accounting for the newly added acquisitions.","David P. Rowland","Yes. Rod, what I would tell you is that 90 days ago on the earnings call, as well as I -- we said that our inorganic contribution would be around 1%, plus or minus. Since then, we've closed Procurian, and so I would tell you that the inorganic would be -- may be a tad higher for the year in the plus or minus 1.5% range, and that reflects Procurian and some of the deals -- other deals that we've closed. That will vary quarter-to-quarter. And I really -- I'm cautious about getting too much in the weeds on the inorganic each and every quarter because, again, you have to remember, in our case, the inorganic is really just an engine for organic growth. We fold these businesses in a very quickly, and they, in many ways, become indistinguishable from our organic business in a very short period of time. So let me just stick with, for the full year, it's going to be in that 1.5% range, and that will vary by quarter.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And just to clarify on that, I mean, is that 1.5% range for the year for inorganic growth, is that pretty secure? Or could that number get to 2% before the year ends?","David P. Rowland","Well, certainly, it depends on to the extent we do other deals as we progress through the year that are outside of what we assume in that 1.5%. But that 1.5%, plus or minus, right, is the ballpark that we think it's in. I'll remind you as well not to get too much in the weeds on this, but I will remind you of something that I've shared at IA Day. The way we think about inorganic is we look at deals that we have done on a rolling 4-quarter basis. So that is the way we will describe inorganic. That's the way we do the calculation. And again, we do that logically because when we get to the 1-year anniversary on these deals, they are very much embedded in our core -- in our organic business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You talked about Brazil and Canada weighing on America's growth, but I think you said U.S. grew high single digits, and that number was double digits all of next year. So can you just talk about what you think is driving that modest deceleration in the U.S. market?","Pierre Nanterme","As you said -- this is Pierre -- it's a modest deceleration for that quarter. I mean, personally, I continue to be externally pleased with our activity in the U.S. U.S. is very important. So we were double digit. I guess, last time, we announced something around 10, even when we said double digit, kind of 10. So high single digits is in the grand scheme of being close enough to where we are expecting to be. For us, what is very important is we grew more than the market. And I guess that this is what is happening in the U.S. as well. We continue to gain market share. And this quarter, it's high single digit, but I have absolutely no concerns that we continue to develop very well in the U.S. It's interesting to see that U.S. performed very well, both consulting and in outsourcing. So it was a very balanced growth across the different dimension of our business.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, as you know, some of your technology partners are talking about weakness in China due to spy gate or whatever you want to call it. Have you seen an impact on your business in China as it relates to that weakness at some of your partners?","Pierre Nanterme","If you look at -- I mean, China, what happened last year, indeed, you have the change in the government. It was in the first half of the -- of 2013 if I remember well. And it's very typical when you're in China that indeed not only the government is changing but all the leaders in the state-owned enterprise, the famous SOEs, are all changing as well. And inevitably, it's creating a kind of pose in China around the major investments scene, if you will, until the new teams and the new leaders will establish themselves with the program and relaunch projects. So again, very pleased with what we delivered this last years in China. Indeed, a couple of -- a form of pose due to this leadership changing in China. But again, on the long term, we continue to be extremely positive with the prospect in China.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to touch on Europe, a little more detail if you don't mind. It's -- it obviously showed at least a very mild acceleration versus last quarter, but maybe more specifics as to what actually is going on from a regional standpoint within Europe, as well as more in the industry vertical and how sustainable is the acceleration. Obviously, that's been a driver for, I think, a lot of investors recently.","Pierre Nanterme","I guess it's for me, David, here, the specialist of Europe. I guess, we might start to see the light at the end of the tunnel in Europe. So let me explain. I mean, first, the macro in Europe are not -- I mean, fundamentally better. So I would characterize it's stable, which is probably an improvement compared of all the uncertainties Europe faced these last probably couple of years. Second, you can, indeed, see some signs, to paraphrase David, of positive improvement. I'm thinking about the U.K. You can see the U.K. economy coming back. I'm thinking about France slowly getting out of the recession. I'm thinking about even Spain starting to rebuild competitiveness and better position. We know that all of this is going to be incredibly slow for also a couple of reasons. So there are not going to be any dramatic improvement, but we have some sign of stabilization, plus. And I'm pleased to see that it's starting to reflect in the progress we are making with some of our large markets in Europe. And I mentioned Germany. I mentioned France. I've mentioned the Netherlands, and I've mentioned Belgium, to mention a few, which are doing very well despite economic environments. Still complex, but I would characterize a slight incremental progress but progress.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","When we look -- that's helpful. When we look at your -- the second half of the year acceleration, I mean, is Europe part of that? In other words, do we expect Europe to pick up steam further into the year as well?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. That's great. And then just a quick question. A couple of years ago at your investor day, you -- I think you gave a good overview of how large to smash that [ph] was or different areas, whether it was mobility or analytics in terms of revenue size. You had mentioned $1 billion here, $2 billion there. You gave us a good idea as to what percentage your revenue was. Is there a way to update that either now or maybe in another near-term layer [ph] ? Maybe just give us some color now if you can.","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, this is -- as you know, we're launching Accenture Digital, and we're going to think on how we would provide more information in due course when we will have, finally, cleaning all the data, all the information in Accenture. We want to be extremely accurate and to define a very strict protocol in the way we communicate the information, so you have a base to measure and a base to evaluate the progress. But indeed, you remember very well that many cross the billion when we announced. So without saying too much, it's a multi-billion-dollar business we're talking about.","David P. Rowland","And growing very well.","Pierre Nanterme","Multibillions.","David P. Rowland","Yes, yes.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","[indiscernible] talking about. If I could just sneak one quick one and now just on the industry verticals. There were some weak pockets in resources, obviously, and communications had a contract also. It seems like that's been resolved, David, is that -- are we on the other side of that now?","Pierre Nanterme","I'm going to jump on this one, David.","David P. Rowland","He's in a talking mood.","Pierre Nanterme","Let me talk to you about the business. I can't explain my instinct. But looking at industry, and I were commenting more specifically [ph], we are covering it with just looking 19 industry segments in Accenture. This is the way we are measuring our different industries, such as banking, capital market, insurance, that -- all that industry segments. 17 out of 19 posted positive growth. And just to give you a flavor first of the depth and breadth of the portfolio of business we're doing, the diversity of what we do across the board, 17 out of 19 in Q1, positive growth. With a few, I'm thinking about life science, health, energy, EHT, electronic and high tech, capital market, high single digit, if not, double digit for some. Now fact of the matter is and you spotted this one, too, on the 19, yet, I have to turn the corner, communications and natural resources. But David will explain.","David P. Rowland","Yes, in the case of communications, we have talked, Darrin, several times about the ongoing transformation of the communications sector. We've talked about the challenges of some of the incumbent telcos as their business evolves. And then we've also talked about the headwind we had with the large CMT client in Europe. That headwind will essentially go away in the second half of this year. There is some residual headwind that we continue to have in the first and second quarter of this year. Frankly, as it turned out, not too different than many of the quarters last year. But once we get past the second quarter, I can say definitively that that year-over-year compare dynamic goes away for CMT. So that is still in the mix of CMT's results this quarter and will be in the mix next quarter. In the case of resources, we've also talked -- that was a business that, for many, many quarters, for an extended period enjoyed very strong growth, and it was driven by a very strong consulting business in particular. And we had several of those contracts that wound down as we turned the page from fiscal '12 to '13, and that was right about the same time that natural resources, as a sector, came under significant pressure, including in several markets around the world, Brazil being one. And so -- but with resources, we've done a very, very nice job kind of repositioning the business, moving into new business services areas, new assets offerings, kind of focusing on the new world around digital, et cetera, and we feel very good about the momentum that's building there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It looks like you grew your non-GDN staff. It's been over a year since you've done that, and I'm wondering what drove it, if it should continue and if you think that we're now at a more of a steady state of GDN versus non-GDN in terms of employee ratios.","David P. Rowland","Well, we had -- we did see some expansion in our headcount in some of our larger, more established geographies. I think, the United States in particular, we saw growth in headcount, and that simply reflects what we're doing on the supply side to have the skills that we need to match the type of work that we're doing as we go forward. In terms of the balance between GDN and non-GDN, I think that continues to -- that will continue to evolve and be fluid. And ultimately, the market will dictate what that mix is. But you are correct in pointing out that we did have growth in our non-GDN headcount.","Pierre Nanterme","And I think it's reflecting as well the nature of the services of the businesses we are investing in. And I'm thinking about the Digital. If you look at this Digital business, at least as a starter, it is more onshore driven than offshore driven. I think all the time, before we're going to follow the same path, as we've seen historically from onshore to offshore, that the skills required to be competitive in Analytics, in Mobility, in Digital Marketing are still more onshore, which might as well reflect this take-up if you will.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That makes sense. Second question, to hit the bookings guidance for the year, it looks like the rest of the year bookings would have to be down quite significantly to maybe up very slightly. But given the first quarter strength in your commentary around the second quarter, I'm wondering if you're really expecting weakness in the second half. Or is this more just a function of being conservative since it's early in the year?","David P. Rowland","Well, Sara, as you know, bookings can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, so I'll just remind you of that. But I'll also say that bookings is like every other metric. We're working as hard as we can to be as far up in the range as we can. And we don't -- there's -- I mean, we just finished one quarter, right? And so we -- as much as we see some reason to be encouraged after one quarter, I don't -- I guess, I don't remember a fiscal year where we've changed annual guidance after a quarter. And all the possibilities and scenarios that we evaluated when we started the year are still in play.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman representing SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Pierre, did your bookings growth on a regional level support your expectation that Europe will accelerate in the second half?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, absolutely. It's -- I mean, the nature and the construct of the booking by region supporting the fact that Europe should accelerate in the second part of the year.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then with regard to digital, I just wanted to go back to a previous question about sizing that market. And without getting too specific, though, I was just wondering about how you're defining digital. Is that the Brian Whipple group, which is Accenture Interactive? That seems much larger than that seeing that you're saying there's 25,000 people there. So what do you mean when you're saying digital these days?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, it is. What we're putting in it, you would find Accenture Interactive, which is the organization dedicated to end-to-end digital marketing capabilities. We are adding Accenture Mobility, which is all about developing, implementing and potentially running mobile solutions. And three, it's Accenture Analytics, which is all about, I mean, mining and doing all the analytic information, including the most advanced analytic and predictive analytics. So it's all the 3 from design to implementation, including the run. That's why we have 23,000 people because, of course, part of our people in the current GDN, Global Delivery Network, are providing the services as well for the execution.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then last question, at the IA Day on October 8, you had previewed movement in some of the operating groups. I was just looking for some update from this vantage point about 2. You had said, I think, accurately, that HPS (sic) [H&PS] would decelerate. And then resources, you had a cautious view for the full year. So looking forward at the dynamic of growth of both of those, should we continue to that sequence to play out for the rest of the year?","David P. Rowland","Yes, we had -- we see some potential for further moderation in H&PS in the second quarter, which I said in the prepared comments. But to be clear, we feel very good about our H&PS business, and we think we're very well positioned as we then progress through the rest of the year. On resources, we do think that resources will be positive this year. And as I commented earlier, we see good momentum in certain parts of the resources business to give us reason to believe that. So we are pleased with the progress. There's still work to do in resources, but we do think that we'll be positive for year.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg representing Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to circle back on the back half a little bit just to make sure that we're in full command of the numbers here. So I guess, if you come in at the midpoint of your Q2 revenue range, it looks like that would put you through the first half of year, at roughly 2.5-ish percent, in terms of constant currency growth. And so what I'm really trying to get at here is, is it prudent for us collectively to be thinking about the lower half of your full year range as being more likely than the upper half? I mean, obviously, you aspire to do better than the midpoint, but just based on where you'll be through the midpoint of the year and given that conversion of consulting bookings to revenue over time has been a little bit unpredictable, can you just comment on whether or not the lower half looks more likely at this juncture in time?","David P. Rowland","Jason, it was a noble attempt, but I'm not going to color within the range after just one quarter of results. We set the range to represent the range of possibilities that we see. And if we didn't think that there was a possibility of being in the upper half of the range, we would have narrowed the range. And so as we progress through the year, we'll get more specific, and the second quarter will be important in terms of how that plays out.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just lastly, a bigger picture question around Europe. We've been picking up more data points, seems to be suggesting more willingness among European clients on the continent to use more low-cost delivery, if you will. And obviously, that kind of offshore market is quite underpenetrated. Are you guys seeing that? Do you see that as being purely additive? Has some of it kind of will stick to your traditional onshore work in Europe? We'd just love your thoughts on how that might play out.","Pierre Nanterme","No, we believe -- I mean, first, indeed, there is, for all sorts of competitiveness reason, appetite for the -- our clients in Europe to leverage more outsourcing fueled by offshore. That's a fact. This trend started more, as you know, in the U.K., in the Nordic countries, and now it's going south in more Continental Europe and touching France, and Netherlands and other markets. That's our point of view [ph] . Again, so it's yes, this one is there. It's playing, we believe, in our favor. A few data points on this is, first, our outsourcing business in Europe is developing very well. If you look these last couple of years, outsourcing been doing -- has been our strong growth point in Europe. And from a cost standpoint, we believe that with our network of delivery centers and with our GDN, we have, indeed, the right cost response -- cost-effective response to this market as we invested earlier in the GDN, if I may say, compared to more local players.","All right. It's probably time now to wrap up. And thanks again for joining us on today's call. With the first quarter behind us and looking at how the business is shaping up for the rest of the year, I feel confident that we have made the right choices, that we are making the right investments and that we are moving at the right pace to capture new waves of growth and position Accenture for the future. Of course, I want to take this opportunity to wish all of you, our investors, analysts and of course, our Accenture people who are listening to the call a very happy holiday season and all the best for the New Year. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. And in the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC. Happy holiday season, and all the best.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 a.m. this morning, Eastern Time and running through March 27, 2014, at midnight.

For the year, we continued to strengthen our leadership position in \"the New\", Digital, Cloud and Security Services. We gained significant market share growing about three times to market with strong growth in nearly all of our largest markets once again. And we returned very substantial cash to our shareholders.","Here are the few highlights for the year. We delivered record new bookings of $42.8 billion. We\u2019re generating revenues of $39.6 billion, another record and of 10.5% in local currency. I am especially pleased with our balanced growth once again across the dimensions of our business. We delivered record earnings per share of $6.74 on an adjusted basis, a 14% increase.","Operating margin was 14.8%, consistent with last year on an adjusted basis. We\u2019re generating outstanding free cash flow of $5.4 billion. We returned $4.3 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and we just announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.46 per share a 10% increase over our prior dividend.","So, we delivered an excellent year in fiscal 2018 and I feel very good about our business, the durability of our performance and the strong momentum we have as we enter the new fiscal year.","Now, let me hand over to David, who\u2019ll review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for taking the time to join us on today\u2019s call.","By any measure our fourth quarter results capped off what has been another truly outstanding year for Accenture. These results were underpinned by our ability to manage our business with rigor and discipline while leveraging the full power of Accenture\u2019s unique leadership position in the marketplace to drive significant value for our clients, our people and our shareholders.","Before I get into the details of the quarter let me summarize a few of the important highlights which once again reflects strong execution across all three financial imperatives for driving superior shareholder value. Revenue momentum continued with very strong net revenue growth of 11% in local currency reflecting our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Our growth continued to significantly outpace the market reflecting both our leadership position in \"the New\" and the durability of our diverse yet highly focused growth model.","Our operating margin of 14.3% came in as expected and was up 10 basis points from last year. We were very pleased with our strong underlying profitability, which allowed us to invest significantly in our business and our people, and we delivered EPS of $1.58 in the fourth quarter up 7% from last year. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $1.9 billion which was better than expected driven by strong growth and profitability and continued industry leading DSOs.","With those high level comments, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $10.8 billion for the quarter reflecting our second highest bookings on record. "," Consulting bookings were $6.1 billion, representing an all-time high and a book-to-bill of 1.1, and outsourcing bookings were $4.7 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0. The dominant theme continued to be strong demand for \"the New\" which represented more than 60% of our total bookings.","For the full fiscal year, we delivered nearly $43 billion in new bookings which represents 12% growth in local currency and we were particularly pleased with double-digit bookings growth and strategy and consulting and system integration.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $10.1 billion, an 11% increase in both USD and local currency. This was a $100 million above the top-end of our guided range. Our consulting revenues for the quarter were $5.5 billion, up 12% in both USD and local currency, and our outsourcing revenues were $4.6 billion, up 9% in both USD and local currency.","Looking at the trends an estimated revenue growth across our business dimensions, we were especially pleased with the strong balance in our growth with double-digit growth across all dimensions Strategy and Consulting Services, Operations and Application Services. And \"the New\" including Digital Cloud and Security related services continued to deliver very strong double-digit growth.","Consistent with last quarter, I\u2019d also like to highlight continued strong demand for Intelligent Platform Services, which was an important contributor to our growth. These services primarily relate to deploy next-generation technologies and SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, and Workday.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, resources led all operating groups with [15%] in local currency, reflecting double-digit growth across all three industries and all three geographies. Communications, Media and Technology grew 15%, driven by continued strong momentum in Software Platforms which posted very strong double-digit growth, especially in North America.","Products delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with 12% growth in the quarter. We saw strong broad-based growth across all three industries in all three geographies.","H&PS grew 6%, driven by strong growth in public service, as well as double-digit growth in both Europe and the growth markets. We saw flat growth in North America primarily reflecting some pressure in our U.S. federal business.","Finally financial services grew 3% reflecting good growth in insurance and modest growth in banking and capital markets. We saw double-digit growth in the growth markets and solid growth in North America offset by some challenges in Europe. We expect a similar level of growth in the first quarter.","Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.8%, compared to 31.5% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7%, compared with 11% in the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.7%, compared to 6.4% for the same quarter last year.","Operating income was $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.3% operating margin, up 10 basis points, compared with quarter four last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, compared with an effective tax rate of 23.9% for the fourth quarter last year. The higher tax rate in the fourth quarter was primarily related to an increase in prior year tax liabilities.","Diluted earnings per share were $1.58, compared with EPS of $1.48 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 7% year-over-year increase. Day services outstanding were 39 days, consistent with last quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.","Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $179 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $5.1 billion compared with $4.1 billion at August 31 last year.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3.4 million shares for $552 million at an average price of $163.24 per share. This week our Board of Directors approved $5 billion of additional share repurchase authority bringing the total to $6 billion.","As Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.46 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15, and represents a $0.13 per share or 10% increase over the previous semi-annual dividend we declared in March.","So before I turn it back over to Pierre, I want to reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. As a reminder we had two unusual items impacting metrics for this year.","Last year we recorded a settlement charge related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan and this year we recorded charges related to tax law changes. The following comparisons exclude these impacts were applicable and reflect adjusted results.","For the full year net revenues grew 10.5% in local currency well above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year with strong growth across all areas of our business with many posting double-digit growth.","Roughly 80% of our overall growth was attributed to strong organic growth of 8%, and \"the New\" represented approximately 60% of revenues for the year reflecting our strategic focus to be a market leader in digital cloud and security-related services.","On an adjusted basis, operating margin of 14.8% was consistent with FY 2017 and in line with our updated guidance while slightly below our original guided range. As I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with the continued underlying margin improvement that allows us - that has allowed us to continue to invest for long-term market leadership.","On an adjusted basis diluted earnings per share was $6.74 per share reflecting 14% growth over FY 2017 and was above the original guided range primarily driven by strong topline growth. Our free cash flow of $5.4 billion was well above our original guided range again reflecting strong operating discipline and industry-leading DSOs.","And finally, we delivered on the objective of our capital allocation model by returning $4.3 billion of cash to shareholders while investing roughly $660 million to acquire critical skills and capabilities and strategic high-growth areas of the market. So again, we had another outstanding year of broad-based growth resulting in significant market share gains underpinned by strong profitability and cash flow.","Now let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David.","Our outstanding results for fiscal year 2018 demonstrate that we continue to execute our profitable growth strategy of differentiation and competitiveness extremely well.","Our very strong revenue was our new bookings reflect excellent demand for our services. We are clearly leading in \"the New\" in the marketplace and we have gained significant market share over the last few years, demonstrating that our services and capabilities are highly relevant to our client's agenda.","Over the last five fiscal years we have delivered compound annual revenue growth of 9% in local currency and 10% compound growth in adjusting earnings per share. And I'm especially pleased that over the same period we have delivered a compound annual total return to shareholders of 21%, significantly above the 15% annual total return for the SAP-500.","Our strong and durable performance reflects the relevant investments we have made ahead of the curve to differentiate our offerings and enhance our competitiveness, as well as the rigor and discipline we bring to managing the business.","Our rapid rotation to \"the New\" digital, cloud and security-related services has contributed significantly to our performance. In fiscal year 2018 \"the New\", accounted for that $23 billion or approximately 60% of total revenues more than the double the revenues just three years ago.","In digital, I'm especially pleased with the success we have had in growing Accenture Interactive. Today we are the market leader operating at scale for many of the world's leading brands.","We're working with Radisson Hotel Group at their global experience agency to improve customer acquisition and retention for more than 1000 in 80 countries. Accenture Interactive leveraging our travel industry expertise, data analytics and digital marketing capabilities to create more personalized customer experiences.","Why is \"the New\" has truly become core to our business. As you would expect we continue to invest and innovate to capture new ways of growth. And indeed we are making excellent progress with Accenture industry X.O which we launched recently, where we are helping clients to range that manufacturing with advanced technologies like the Internet of Things, connected devices and digital platforms.","With ABB, the switch industrial manufacturer, we developed an IoT Solution to connect data from smart sensors embedded in its electric models to customers. With a new mobile app portal and sensor platform, ABB can now apply more advanced analytic that's deepen its knowledge about multiple performance, competitive assets and customer needs.","We continue to invest in our industry X.0 capabilities and complete its three acquisitions in the first quarter; Pillar Technology, a software firm in Columbus, Ohio, Mindtribe, a hardware engineering company in San Francisco and Designaffairs, a design firm in Germany.","At the same time, we continue to leverage our unique role in the technology ecosystem as re-leading partner of key platform players including SAP, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce which are also rotating rapidly to \"the New\".","That evolves to a new generation of cloud-enabled platforms with advanced analytic, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. We are working with a broad range of clients across industries around the world to transform their businesses using SAP S\/4 HANA Solution from Lion, Australia's largest brewer, to Chelsea, the Latin American utility, to Barilla, the Italian food company.","Turning now to the geographic dimension of our business, I feel very pleased that we deliver another year of very strong broad-based growth in most of our largest market. Starting with North America, I'm delighted with the acceleration in our business with revenue growth of 9% in local currency for the year driven primarily by the United States.","In Europe we continue to drive high single-digit growth. We delivered 9% growth in local currency for the year led by double-digit growth in Germany, Italy, France and Island as well as high single digit growth in Spain.","And finally our gross markets are becoming an increasingly significant contributor to our performance with 16% growth in local currency led once again by very strong double-digit growth in Japan as well as double-digit growth in Australia, Brazil and Singapore.","Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our talent strategy to continue leading in \"the New\", which clearly sets us apart in the marketplace. Our people intimacy makes the difference in delivering high quality services to our clients.","And as we transform Accenture, we are making substantial investments to ensure that we have the most relevant and specialized skill and scale to meet our client's needs. And we are particularly focus on attracting and developing the best possible team of leaders in our industry.","And I'm extremely pleased that in fiscal year 2018 we promoted about 700 new managing directors and hired nearly 300 from outside Accenture adding very significant industry expertise and specialization.","At Accenture we continue to believe that diversity is a critical source of competitive advantage. I'm especially proud that just these months, we were named the top company, number on the Thomson Reuters Diversity and Inclusion Index which recognizing the 100 most diverse and inclusive companies in the world.","And finally, I want to thank our 459,000 people for their unique passion and energy which makes all the difference for Accenture and more importantly for our client.","With that, I will turn it over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2019. Over to you, David.","David Rowland ","Thank you, Pierre.","Before I get into our business outlook I want to highlight a few changes for FY 2019 and beyond. For our Fiscal 2019 we adopted \"the New\" revenue intention accounting standards and have posted reconciliation on our IR website.","In summary the adoption does not have a material impact on our financial reporting. However, you'll notice that revenues will now include reimbursements and as a result going forward we will report a single revenue number which will include reimbursements. Also as a result to these changes there will be a corresponding impact to operating margin which restated for FY 2018 would be 14.4% compared to the reported operating margin of 14.8%. Our FY 2019 guidance in comparisons to FY 2018 reflect the adoption of \"the New\" revenue standard including the change in the presentation of revenues and the resulting impacts on operating margin, as well as the updated standards for pension accounting and income taxes on intercompany transfers.","I'd also like to highlight a change we will be making in the payment of our dividends. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we will move from a semi-annual dividend payment schedule to a quarterly dividend payment schedule. This change will take effect in FY 2020 and in FY 2019, we will continue to pay dividends on a semi-annual basis.","Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect revenues to be in the range of $10.35 billion to $10.65 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and reflects an estimated 7% to 10% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year 2019, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in USD will be about negative 2.5% compared to fiscal 2018.","For the full fiscal 2019, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal 2018. For operating margin, we expect fiscal 2019 to be 14.5% to 14.7%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2018 results.","We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25% and this compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23% in fiscal 2018. For earnings per share, we expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $6.98 to $7.25 or 4% to 8% growth over adjusted fiscal 2018 results.","For cash flow for the full fiscal 2019, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $5.75 billion to $6.15 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow range to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2.","And finally we expect to return at least $4.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?","Angie Park","Thanks David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Greg, would you provide instructions for those on the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","I wonder if you could start off by talking about what the margin drivers will look like and how we should think about the base margin exiting this year and how margins will expand next year?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I mean the margin drivers are really consistent with what I've talked about previously and you could really look at it in two ways, I mean first of all our profitability fundamentally starts with strong contract profitability and that gets into the way we price our services, and gets into the discipline with which we deliver those services to the expected economics and so contract profitability is always high on our profit agenda.","And of course it can be impacted by a number of things including the mix of work in a particular quarter or year across the business dimensions, it can also be influenced by the mix of work across geographies.","But we're very focused on profitability and of course our strategy which is focused on leading and delivering high value services to our clients to be outcome driven in the work that we perform for our clients and of course our focus on leading in \"the New\", all of that supports our objective of expanding our contract profitability over time.","The other two things if you look at it through another lens would be that our profit drivers are also focused on efficiently managing the evolution of our payroll structure in relation to the evolution of our revenue and of course we have an ongoing focus on that. And then finally we're always focused on continuing to improve our SG&A structure in the efficiency of the cost of doing business and all of those things come into our margin expansion objectives for next year.","Joseph Foresi","And then as my follow-up just staying with margins. On the M&A front, what's your expectations for contribution to the top line and how do you balance that with your desire to obviously expand margins? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, so we expect our inorganic contribution next year to be about 1.5%, that's about a point lower than our experience in FY 2018 but it\u2019s important to reinforce that we are firmly committed to our inorganic strategy again using inorganic as an engine of organic growth. This year we would expect to spend up to $1.5 billion consistent with our capital allocation strategy as always given the right opportunities and the right circumstances, we could certainly spend more than that.","And from a profitability standpoint, all of that is in the mix of how we manage our margin expansion over time, you've heard us say many times that underneath the margin that we report externally, we have underlined margin improvement which I referenced from time to time and our focus as an organization is to get sufficient improvement in our underlying margin so that we can absorb all of our investments which includes our ambition around acquisitions as part of our growth strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso","Can you talk a little bit on the people side, your attrition rate was 18% versus 15% a year ago seems a lot of your peers are showing rising rates. Can you sort of dig down a little bit on why and maybe what efforts you're trying to maybe slow that down or you\u2019re getting more comfortable at this higher level?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, on attrition, so let me directly answer your question. We are constant with the 17 not at all. Let\u2019s be clear, I think we are today, we believe it\u2019s reality level of attrition given the level of competition for talents in the marketplace. We have today zero issues to hire the talent that we need and it\u2019s true everywhere across the world and so we are - and from way we do to be attractive, I mean first our strategy, I mean the rotation to \"the New\", the fact that we are leading in all these new ways of interactive manufacturing Internet, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, cloud, blockchain and I can mention and it is creating a very attractive place to be.","Second is our performance. We are the leader in the industry and of course it's attractive for talent. I was just reading this morning, its fresh from France, I\u2019m in Paris], we are the number one in all the dimensions as in professional services from an industry standpoint, from a technology standpoint and across the board.","So we have zero issue being attractive and finally it\u2019s our balance strategy and the environment we providing to our people. I think we worked a lot to create the right workplace where people are collaborating. We are creating a right environment to add multiple cultures coming together and developing a lot of creative thinking. And it\u2019s our tone and style we are developing at Accenture and its probably to benefit of being the leader.","Edward Caso","My other question it relates to margins, around how much benefit are you getting from platform that you built from reuse it seems like the - a lot of \"the New\" starting to settle in here and it seems like there is an opportunity for an industry leader to sort of reprint what you\u2019ve already done?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes on this jumping on this one David, I mean for us platforms are extremely important to the success of our country. I think this is very clear what we\u2019re calling now the intelligent platforms because the platform provided by our partners SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, Workday and Salesforce but that could add that so system and others are becoming more and more intelligent and our strategy has always been the same.","We leveraged the best platform in the marketplace and this and is important on top of them we build industry specifications. So for instance when we\u2019re working with an SAP we have developed a very specific add on that platform in upstream oil and gas. The same in utility we\u2019re working with the Salesforce.com on joint company called Velocity and the objective of Velocity is add speed develop industry specific solutions on top of the Salesforce capabilities. So this is our strategy and it\u2019s working so far very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Congrats on double-digit growth. I\u2019ll ask on the revenue momentum, I am curious it sort of bigger brand on the outlook just if we look back a year ago, you exited the year growing 8% I believe and you guided to 5% to 8% revenue growth. So this year your guidance is same 5% to 8% but you using at 11%. So I am curious how might the upside case be different this year versus last year any considerations across macro demand competition, digital being little bit more mature et cetera?","David Rowland","I would say I mean first of all there is no doubt that we have strong momentum in the business and there is also no doubt that we feel very good about our business and the momentum that we have. And you could point to as you mentioned the fact that we exited 2018 with very strong broad based organic growth by the way our organic growth in quarter four was 10%. We had record bookings in the second half of the year.","We had our all-time high in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter it was second only to quarter three. And we got good line of sight to 1.5% in organic and so there is a lot of things for us to feel positive about and we do to be clear.","At the same time, you also have to reflect on the fact as we do that this is the point in time where we are providing guidance over the longer cycle. And so that comes in to the mix by the very nature of the fact that we\u2019re guiding over essentially 12 months.","And also we take stock of what\u2019s happening in the macro environment as well and may be its debatable but I would say from our standpoint and perhaps this year the macro environment is incrementally more volatile than it was last year at the same point in time. You think about the potential for a hard Brexit. And of course you can reflect on all of the disputes around global trade and so we think about the global environment over that 12 month horizon.","And it\u2019s really in that context that we guide to 5% to 8% and the other thing Tien-tsin I would remind you and the others of is that we guide to 5% to 8% in a market our investable basket market that is growing in the range of 2% to 3%. And so anywhere on that guidance range of 5% to 8% we would be taking significant share and if you think about the upper end of the range which is where we always strive for then at 8% we would be growing more than 2.5 times the market.","And so 5% to 8% which is consistent with what we\u2019ve done the last three years is in fact reflective of what we would consider be outstanding growth especially in the upper end of that range reflective of the Accenture as a leader. Anything we do above that is exceptional growth and it is true that we had a pattern over the last four years for delivering double-digit growth and we\u2019ll see how 2019 plays out and we\u2019ll update our guidance appropriately as the year progresses.","Tien-tsin Huang","Agreed, now it seems very prudent. I\u2019ll ask my quick follow up just on the financial services segment I know you mentioned a little bit David just it lag a little bit was the impact broad based or isolated to a region or few clients it sound like North America it sound like it was okay just wanted to get a little bit detail there? Thanks so much.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, sure so very pleased to comment on financial services. If I had to summarize the situation it\u2019s mainly Europe where we are facing this challenging of lower growth. And it\u2019s mainly due to some large program we had in Europe winding down in the context of 2018. So something which is not un-typical by the way that happened in other industries this last few years. I remember CMT in Europe just two years ago we had the same phenomenon of some large program getting to a close.","And so what it is you need to do and now people are working very hard you need to replenish the pipeline to build the backlog and that is going to create the revenues of tomorrow. So our people are working on it, we have encouraging signals that indeed the pipeline in financial services in Europe is building up. We certainly believe that it\u2019s going to take couple of quarters to show in our growth, so we expect the H1 to still be in the low single digit and then H2 to get back more power with the rest of Accenture. So I do not think anything un-typical are coming from anything happening to this industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Rod Bourgeois","So in terms of the revenue growth outlook I want to ask, are you seeing actual headwinds starting to impact your growth in upcoming months or is your guidance simply accounting for the possibility that\u2019s the macro headwinds could grow over the course of the next 12 months. I am just trying gauge are you seeing visibility into flowing or you just prudently thinking about the next 12 months and what might happen?","Pierre Nanterme","I cannot take on this one because I think David mentioned already some element of this. From an Accenture standpoint, we\u2019re pleased with where we are and no doubt we are entering Q1 with good momentum.","Now for us Q1 is the end of the calendar 2018. So we\u2019re moving to a new calendar January the 1st, so to be very specific it\u2019s not something we see now. But the role of the leadership of any company is to look beyond the horizon and to understand what might happen in calendar 2019.","And just to build on what David mentioned for instance I mean the Brexit negotiation going to get to end and we\u2019ll know what\u2019s going to happen and its seems we more moving to something like a hard Brexit than a soft one. What we\u2019re calling the trade war again not signaled as we speak to you now that there is an effect but this trade war might impact some industries moving forward and by impacting these industries there could be a ripple effect on our business.","We are watching as well very closely Latin America. Latin America, we've been doing well despite the complexities in that region, you\u2019ll see what we're doing in Brazil which is absolutely great. Now Latin America prospects are concerning as well, and not to mention the other risk we all know you\u2019re starting to see again some volatility in the commodity pricing.","Not too long ago we talk about the oil price at $30 a barrel and now it\u2019s getting to be very, very high. We are about to see some commodity pricing volatility again all of these we will see in calendar 2019, how things going to unfold.","So that is the answer, nothing now but our job is to consider and to risk adjusting our guidance accordingly. Now that being said, what David said is absolutely true five to eight is an aggressive guidance if you look at the growth of the basket of competitor and the market. So it\u2019s at 8% that would be two to three times the market. I would not consider that as conservative.","Rod Bourgeois","And then on the free cash flow outlook, you outperformed on cash flow in fiscal 2018 which sets up a tough comparison for fiscal 2019. Is there anything lumpy in the fiscal 2019 free cash flow outlook, I know you sometimes include some buffer on DSOs in case that moves around but are there any special lumpy items in the fiscal 2019 free cash flow outlook?","David Rowland","I mean there's no special lumpy items that\u2019s - again we focus more on the absolute number in relation to net income and that ratio which is the guidance is actually quite strong in that regard then we do the year-over-year change. I mean we had beyond an outstanding year in DSOs in 2018, we really had an exceptional year and from a guidance standpoint, you're not going to assume that happens every year and so for example Rod we have allowed for the potential of some increase in DSOs as an example.","But there is not anything other than the normal things that we would kind of factor in that\u2019s in the mix. Again we would be very pleased to land a free cash flow in the range of 1.1 to 1.2 times net income.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","Let me just start off, I mean can you just give a little more color on what you are seeing around wage inflation specifically in \"the New\" or maybe some of your better digital areas. How is it around pricing for those areas, it seems like giving the margin guidance you should be able to pass through price increase to offset but just a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing on those two variables?","David Rowland","Yes, I mean it\u2019s - I will make a couple of comment and Pierre may add as well. I mean first of all it\u2019s with the size of our workforce and the diversity of skills and geographies et cetera, it's really hard to talk about wage questions in aggregate and for that reason we typically stay away from them.","But let me just generically say that, I mean certainly when you look at the high growth areas of the market especially the leading edge areas of the market, there are in many cases premium salaries that go with premium skills and we hire a lot of those people and we always - we pay the market rate.","On the other hand, we do get differentiated pricing in digital and that's the point is that we're not, we want to pay at a market relevant rate to retain people kind of fit for purpose for the skill set that we're talking about but what we focus on is whether or not we can get the right bill rates and ultimately yield the profitability off of those resources and so in that regard, there's not anything that we're concerned about, we as I said earlier we're always focused on driving our contract profitability upward which ultimately means that we have to get the right pricing in relation to what we're paying people and we feel positive about that.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, and maybe just to add on this, I mean, to attract and retain people, it's not always about the money. And it's interesting when you're driving analysis and surveys, the number one wish of the people working at that center is interesting work that is number one, the second is all the working environments and the balance and three the comp.","So at the end of the day, the point is not about giving more money or to be the one who could have paid the most, it\u2019s going to be the company is going to provide the most interesting work for our people and this is what we do with our rotation to \"the New\" and working with our diamond clients.","Second, creating the right working environments I mentioned that already and indeed competitive compensation, so it's a mix of things you need to work on.","Darrin Peller","And just sort of a follow-up, I mean could you just deconstruct a little more around the growth of that specifically maybe breaking down what you are seeing in Cloud versus some of the center interactive side which I know has been a big party of growth also and if there is any other big call outs worth mentioning and thanks again guys.","David Rowland","I\u2019ll make a couple of comments in terms of just some facts and Pierre may add some color as well. I mean the - first of all our growth in \"the New\" was strong double-digits and that has continued and when we say strong double-digits as we've said before, we mean very strong double-digits. So let's say well north of 20% is the growth rate that we see in \"the New\".","And when you look at the components of \"the New\", we also see strong double-digit growth across every component, so when you look at digital and the three components of digital, Accenture Interactive, Accenture Applied Intelligence and Industry X, when you look at our cloud related services and when you look at security, all of those businesses are contributing with strong double-digit growth to the overall numbers that we very often talk about with respect to \"the New\".","These are very attractive markets, we are - and strengthening our leadership position in each and we're benefiting from the growth that goes with it.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, we could be even clearer because you mentioned the 20% as [zero], I think all of them are growing more than 20%, to be very clear.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","I wanted to ask a follow-up on that. I think you guys have a fact in there that \"the New\" grew about 25% constant currency in fiscal year 2018, I guess that means the legacy business declined last versus last year and actually I have legacy business almost being flat to slightly up, so just want to see if maybe we've reached a point where we won't see that core legacy business declining as much as we have in the past because there's a certain amount of spend that always will occur with that business going forward?","Pierre Nanterme","Excellent analysis indeed. The core is declining less than in the prior year, so you made exactly the right analysis and calculation. But the rationale behind is we worked hard to not to protect the call but to make the call more competitive. So it was not like if our strategy was we\u2019re going to put all our investment behind \"the New\" and let the core decline or becoming uncompetitive which would have been extremely bad.","So we invested as well in the core in the form if I have to summarize of massive robotic and automation and modernization of what we are providing in term of - for instance application outsourcing or other activities you would put into core where indeed we have reached a level of automation which is extremely high and accordingly we have been able to protect the margin of the core and limit the erosion. So, you're absolutely right, but it's more because we worked on it for robotic automation and modernization.","Bryan Keane","And then, David, without the adoption restatement and changes in the pension accounting, just curious if operating margin still would've expanded the same 10 to 30 basis points? Some folks are getting a boost through 606 on operating margin or pension accounting. I just want to make sure that's not the case here. That\u2019s still be underlying operating margin expansion without those changes? Thanks.","David Rowland","That is correct. It would be the same without the changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Bryan Bergin","I wanted to follow-up on the macro demand questions. In your client budgets, the conversations you're having in the U.S., is there any indication that there's been a pull forward of tax spending demand in 2018 due to things like tax reform or just broader deregulation?","David Rowland","I would say, no. I don't think we have any evidence that there's been a pull forward of spending for those reasons. No.","Bryan Bergin","And then my follow-up, as you're building new, new areas in area - places like Industry X.0 and Applied Intelligence? Can you give us a sense of scale of these businesses? And then just talk about what you learn from building out the interactive business that you were able to leverage in these new areas?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. Now we have a kind of routine we established at Accenture, which is moving from the first and this is a role of R&D specially Paul Daugherty, an Accenture Research, is to understand what's coming. And clearly as you know we're spending $700 million in R&D at Accenture. And their job is to intensify to next ways and putting them in incubation in what we call strategic growth initiatives. So we incubate. This is what we did for the other businesses.","We're starting to test business models. And when we get into a level of maturity, and we see the opportunity to scale and create an impact with client then we industrialize and move to the big business of Accenture. So we learn about this process of incubation to industrialization. Second, it's all about talent and leadership. And this is where we have the combination between acquisition and organic growth.","So indeed we are making acquisition and I mentioned in the call, for instance, the three acquisitions we made in Industry X.0 this very quarter. To attract the skills, so companies of mid - small to mid-size that having deep skill especially in Industry X.0 on embedded software and product design where we are investing a lot. So we know now how to combine and of course all of this supported, I could see Amy Fuller next to me, our Chief Marketing Officer with good communication campaign we putting behind.","So we have developed a savoir-faire in term of incubation - detection, incubation, industrialization and launching the campaign behind with a good mix of organic and inorganic behind. So its quite well oiled, if you will as a machine.","Angie Park","Greg, we have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","That question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Harshita Rawat","My question is on headcount follow-up to a previous one. So you're hiring almost 100,000 people annually on a gross basis. That's obviously a big number. So my question is where are you hiring people from? Are you looking at different kinds of skills versus what you've looked at historically? And more broadly how should we think about your ability to continue to find and not just attract people and drive more automation in a very tight labor market which puts constraints in a supply of people?","Pierre Nanterme","On this, I mean, we are - we continue to hire on onshore large markets especially in the context of our rotation to \"the New\", our largest markets are as you know, U.S., U.K., a lot in Germany, Japan if I had to mention maybe - maybe three countries I would certainly mention the U.S., Germany and Japan where we are recruiting a lot. But it\u2019s true as well in our other metro markets U.K., France, Italy, Spain.","So onshore deep skills probably more around high-value consulting in the context of \"the New\" and in the context of driving our largest relationship with clients especially with our Diamond clients, and we continue to hire significantly on - let's call at the offshore especially in India.","And thank you for giving me the opportunity not to polarize that now that we'd e all about onshore and offshore would be called legacy. It's not true at all. Not true at all. And everybody would visit Accenture in India would be blown away by the quality of the people and their rotation to \"the New\". We had an event last year in term of R&D and innovation where some of our, I'm not going to mention the name, but some of our largest brand and clients from the U.S. being moving there for less than an hour to support that team who've been working on truly innovative session and brainstorming.","So, we continue to invest onshore and offshore, drive the right balance and having the right skills. And this is exactly why, to your second question, is there scarcity in the pool? We don't believe. We operate in many markets. And in many markets we find the right people including business scientists. I think we have more than 2000 business scientists at Accenture, growing, and we could find these people all around the world. Again to your prior question, Accenture today is very attractive. Good for us. So we need to take our chance. And while we are attractive based on our results and positioning, we have no issue in finding the right people.","Pierre Nanterme","So, thanks a lot for listening and joining us on today's call. As you might have guessed, we are and I'm extremely pleased with our strong finish and excellent performance for the first fiscal year 2018.","No doubt we have a strong momentum on during fiscal year 2019 and with our leading position in \"the New\" the significance investments we are making and the disciplined management of the business, I'm very confident in our ability to continue gaining market share and delivering value for all our stakeholders.","We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any question please feel free to call Angie and the team. All the best to everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Angie Park. Please go ahead.","Angie Park","Thank you, Greg. And thanks everyone for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings announcement. As operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.","On today's call you will hear from David Rowland, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call.","David will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. David will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2019. We will then take your questions before David provides a wrap up at the end of the call.","Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call including our business outlook are forward-looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for our investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now, let me turn the call over to David.","David Rowland","Thank you, Angie. And thanks so much to all of you for joining us on today's call.","Accenture delivered another strong quarter and I couldn't be more pleased with our overall performance as we continue to execute our growth strategy and create significant value for all of our stakeholders our clients, employees and shareholders. We again delivered revenue growth well ahead of the market as well as strong profitability and free cash flow, while continuing to make substantial investments for long-term market leadership.","Here are a few to highlights for the quarter. We delivered new bookings of $10.6 billion which was in the range we expected. We generated record revenues of $11.1 billion at the top of our guided range with 8.4% growth in local currency.","We delivered earnings per share of $1.93 an 8% increase compared to adjusted earnings per share last year. Operating margin was 15.5% an expansion of 20 basis points. Our free cash flow was very strong at $2 billion. We returned $1.4 billion dollars in cash to shareholders through our share repurchases and the payment of our semi-annual dividend.","So, all-in-all, it was another strong quarter by any measure. Looking forward, I feel very good about our business and our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter and in doing so to complete what will be another truly outstanding year for Accenture.","Now let me hand it over to KC to review the numbers in greater detail. KC?","KC McClure","Thank you, David, and thank you all of you for joining us on today's call.","Let me start by saying we were very pleased with our third quarter results which were in line to our expectations and were strong across many dimensions of our business. Once again, our results demonstrate the power of our highly differentiated growth strategy. As we have often stated a key intent of our growth strategy is to create durability in our revenue growth at a level that is consistently above the market taking share and strengthening our position as a leader.","Against this objective, we have created a unique footprint that includes scale and leadership and the world's largest and most critical geographic markets and industries. This footprint along with our highly relevant offerings delivered within our end-to-end service model is key to being a market leader in helping our clients rotate to the new.","Our third quarter and year-to-date results are an illustration of our growth model in action and based on the strength of our results and the confidence and the visibility we have in our fourth quarter, we are increasing key elements of our full-year outlook which I will cover in more detail later in the call.","Importantly, our results and updated guidance reflects very strong execution against our three financial imperatives for driving superior shareholder value. Revenue growth of 8.4% in local currency in the third quarter continued to be driven by strong double-digit growth in all three areas of the new including digital, cloud and security related services. This strong top-line growth was broad based with several areas growing double digits or high single digits. Revenues landed in the range we expected and importantly, we did see the anticipated improvement in financial services and the U.S. Federal business.","Operating margin of 15.5% expanded 20 basis points for the quarter and reflects strong underlying profitability allowing us to invest at scale, in our people and in our business."," And we delivered very strong EPS of $1.93 which represents 8% growth compared to adjusted EPS last year even with an FX headwind of over 4%. And we have record free cash flows for both the quarter of $2 billion and year-to-date of $4.2 billion which reflects both our strong profitability and our excellent DSO management.","We are well positioned to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. We continue to execute against our strategic capital allocation objectives with year-to-date investments and acquisitions of approximately $1.1 billion and over $4.1 billion return to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.","Now, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $10.6 billion for the quarter, consolidated bookings were $6 billion with a book to bill of 1; outsourcing bookings were $4.6 billion with a book to bill of 0.9. This quarter, our bookings continue to be well balanced across the dimensions of our business and the dominant driver of our bookings in the quarter continue to be high demand for digital, cloud and security related services which we estimated approximated 65% of our new bookings.","Overall, Q3 bookings landed in the range we expected. As you know, quarterly bookings can be lumpy which you've seen in our year-to-date results. And that is consistent with our historical pattern. Looking forward, we have a very strong pipeline and we expect strong bookings in Q4.","Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, a 4% increase in U.S. dollars, an 8.4% in local currency and were at the top of our previously guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.2 billion up 3% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency.","Outsourcing revenues were $4.9 billion, a 5% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency. Looking at the transit estimated revenue growth across our business dimensions, technology services posted strong high single digit growth, strategy and consulting services grew mid-single digits and operations continued its trend of double-digit growth. Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Resources grew 19% in local currency delivering its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Continued momentum was driven by double-digit growth across all three industries and all three geographies. Products grew 8% reflecting continued strength in our largest operating group.","Demand continued to be broad based across all three industries and all three geographies. Communications media and technology grew 7% reflecting continued strong double-digit growth in software platforms and we had strong balance growth across all three geographies.","H&PS delivered 6% growth in line with our expectations. Europe was double-digit growth and we were very pleased with the strong growth in North America which reflected strong growth in our U.S. federal business.","Finally, as expected, we saw an up tick in financial services this quarter with 4% growth. Insurance again grew double digits across all geographies and we saw some improvement in banking capital markets globally including in Europe. Overall, financial services delivered double-digit growth in growth markets, strong growth in North America partially offset by contraction in Europe.","Turning to the geographic dimensions of our business, I am very pleased with the continued demand across all three of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered 9% revenue growth in local currency driven by continued strong growth in the United States. In Europe, revenues grew 5% in local currency with double-digit growth in Italy and Ireland as well as mid single-digit growth in the U.K. And we delivered another very strong quarter in growth markets with 13% growth in local currency led by Japan which again had very strong double-digit growth. We had double-digit growth in China and Brazil as well.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.8% compared with 31.2 for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7% compared with 10.3 for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expenses was 5.6% compared to 5.5% for Q3 of last year. Operating income was 1.7 billion in the third quarter reflecting a 15.5% operating margin up 20 basis points compared with Q3 last year.","As a reminder, in Q3 of last year, we recognized a charge related to tax law changes. The following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.6% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.8% for the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.93 compared with adjusted EPS of $1.79 in Q3 of last year.","DSO was 39 days compared to 40 days last quarter and 39 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion net of property and equipment additions of $140 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $4.8 billion compared with $5.1 billion at August 31.","And with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.8 million shares for $488 million at an average price of $173.95 per share. At May 31, we had approximately $4.1 billion of share repurchase authority remain.","Finally, as David mentioned on May 15, 2019, we made our second semi-annual dividend payment for fiscal '19 in the amount of $1.46 per share bringing the total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.9 billion.","So, in summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and are now focused on Q4 in closing out another strong year.","With that, let me turn it back to David.","David Rowland","Thank you, KC.","Our strong results for the third quarter and year-to-date demonstrate that we continue to execute our growth strategy extremely well. In particular, we continue to benefit from our leadership position in \"the New\" where revenues again grew at a double-digit rate with broad based growth across all components of \"the New\" including the Accenture Interactive upon intelligence industry [indiscernible], cloud and security.","And as KC mentioned, our third quarter and year-to-date performance is powered by our unique leadership footprint in the marketplace with breadth and scale across the most strategic geographies, industries and capabilities and this provides for durability and consistency in our performance and uniquely positions us to deliver seamless outstanding service to our global clients.","While there are many positive aspects of our third quarter results; today, I want to focus on Accenture Technology, which is the largest part of our business overall and also accounts for the majority of our revenues in \"the New.\" So, in many ways, Accenture Technology is really the engine of our strong leadership position in \"the New.\" We believe Accenture has the strongest and most innovative technology capability in our industry with scale and leadership in all the areas that are most relevant to our clients.","To-date all companies are digital businesses and certainly Accenture is a digital technology company at our core with advanced capabilities such as data and analytics, automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning.","Last quarter, I highlighted three key focus areas in Accenture Technology that powered growth in our business. And today, I'd like to dig a little deeper. First, in intelligent platform services, we apply our digital capabilities, innovation and industry expertise on top of the leading core platforms, SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and Workday to help clients drive large scale enterprise wide transformation. We are proud to be a leading partner of all the key players and we see continued strong demand for intelligent platform services which again grew at a double-digit rate in quarter three and accounts for about 40% of our total revenues.","As one example, we're helping a leading fashion retailer with a global implementation of SAP S\/4HANA that leverages myConcerto. Our proprietary AI powered development platform, myConcerto brings together our deep industry knowledge and differentiated tools and methodologies to help clients innovate and accelerate platform implementation. Our work is driving greater synergies across the retailer's global brands and building a strong foundation for future growth.","The second area intelligence software engineering services is focused on developing and delivering the custom systems that our clients are increasingly demanding. With more than 30,000 people, we have one of the largest teams of specialized software engineers and architects solving the most challenging problems in agile and creative ways using data, the cloud, artificial intelligence and other new technologies.","As an example, we're helping Swisscom, Switzerland's leading telecom company transform into a digital service provider by leveraging our proprietary digital omnichannel platform with AI, machine learning and analytics. We are increasing the precision and personalization of the customer experience across all their channels.","And third, an intelligent cloud and infrastructure services, we provide clients with powerful differentiated solutions from cloud strategy and migration to managed services and cloud security. We are the leading partner of Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform which are often at the heart of our clients' agendas to adopt new and leading technologies and rotate their own businesses to \"the New.\"","To-date, Accenture has worked on more than 25,000 cloud computing projects for clients including 80% of the Fortune Global 100 and we have more than 77,000 people trained in cloud technology. A good example is our work with Del Monte Foods to unlock innovation and streamline their operations by migrating hundreds of servers and critical SAP Enterprise wide applications to the cloud in less than four months. They're benefiting from a more agile operating environment, real-time customer insights and a 35% reduction in IP cost freeing up resources to grow the core business.","There are three common threads that run through all of these areas in technology one is innovation and in fact technology is at the heart of our innovation agenda. A great illustration is our AI high powered Microsoft myWizard platform which you've heard us mention many times previously, which differentiates our service delivery by improving client's business performance with superior productivity and predictability. And we continue to leverage our unique innovation architecture, which integrates our capabilities from research, ventures, labs, innovation centers and delivery centers. Second is our powerful ecosystem relationships as the largest independent provider of technology services. While scale is certainly a factor, it's also our ability to co-innovate with our partners delivering outcomes and value at speed in \"the New\" and looking to the next new that differentiates us in the marketplace.","And the final piece that underpins our technology leadership and is pervasive across everything we do is our unmatched industrialized global delivery capability which uniquely positions Accenture to deliver large scale complex programs.","Let me now switch gears and comment on our continued commitment to invest for long-term market leadership including operating investments related to assets and solutions, talent and innovation as well as capital investments to acquire critical skills and capabilities and strategic high growth markets.","So far this year, we've deployed approximately $1.1 billion in capital on acquisitions with the majority focus in \"the New\" and especially Accenture Interactive where we've completed nine deals so far this year. I'm particularly pleased with the acquisition of Droga5 by far our biggest of the year which has a large New York based creative agency that significantly strengthens our capabilities to design, build and run customer experiences that grow brands and businesses.","But before I hand it back to KC, I want to take a moment to acknowledge some of the external recognition we've received. Accenture rose to number 28 on Brandz list of top 100 most valuable brands. And we also achieved our highest ranking ever on Forbes list of the top global brands and we had our highest ever -digit increases in brand value on both list. I'm also very pleased that we were named for the first time into FastCompany rankings for innovation. First, in the category of world's most innovative companies and second for world changing ideas. And finally, Accenture was ranked number one on Barron's new list of the most sustainable international companies.","Before I close, I want to briefly mention that our CEO succession process is going very well. And as I said last quarter, we expect to complete the process by the end of this fiscal year.","With that, I'll turn it over to KC to provide our updated business outlook. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks David.","Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, we expect revenues to be in the range of $10.85 billion to $11.15 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year 19, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 3% compared to fiscal '18.","For the full fiscal 19, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal '18. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal '19 to be 14.6%, a 20 basis point expansion over fiscal 18 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23% in fiscal '18.","For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '19 to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.35 or 8% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '18 results.","For the full fiscal '19, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be the range of $5.85 billion to $6.25 billion. Property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion.","Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. And we continue to expect to return at least $4.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.","With that let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?","Angie Park","Thanks KC. I'd ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask the question. Frank would you provide instructions for those on the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Good morning, David. Good morning KC.","David Rowland","Good morning, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I want to start with a question on bookings. Generally [indiscernible] with the book-to-bill lower than one, can you detail a bit? Particularly when I looked at the comment it says 65% of bookings are in the New implies a third is from legacy services. Is this what sort of there you have a need to provide clients with higher productivity requirements? Is this a plan we should be looking at more carefully in the future because that's what FX bookings growth and in the New were the growth, is that a visibility question we should be asking with regards to a higher cloud component or higher agile development component. Does that also bring with it low visibility?","KC McClure","Okay. Thanks Ashwin. Let me just cover a lot of the questions there. You have booking, so maybe I will first start with as I mentioned bookings really were in the range that we expected and they were quite well balanced. And we'd like that they are about 65% in the New. So just as a reminder, that's well for covering up so long bookings can be lumpy by quarter. So you see that in our results this year where we had really strong bookings record bookings in Q2. But there are historical patterns, we've always had some lumpiness and variability quarter-to-quarter of bookings.","So as it relates to what we're seeing, the second half is really playing out largely as expected. We'd like our position where we are year-to-date. It really is where we anticipated that we would be at this time of the year. And so they're looking forward and talking about your visibility question. Now based on the strength of our pipeline and the visibility that we do have, we do see strong bookings in Q4. There's not really an element of the new impact of visibility, we like that we have the majority of our bookings in the New. And we feel that we're really well positioned based on where we are to-date with what we can see for Q4 bookings to be well positioned for next year.","And I think that really just points to as you were talking about our offerings, the relevance of our offerings and our capabilities in the marketplace.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And then, with the anticipated improvement in financial services that's good to see that come through. Looking forward is it -- should we assume that continues to step up?","KC McClure","So as you said, we were also pleased with the up tick in financial services that we saw this quarter and that did come in as expected. And I did note, I will say again that we were particularly pleased with our strong growth in North America and the continued double-digit growth that we have in the growth markets. And while Europe did contract, it is -- we did see improvement in banking capital markets and as it relates to what we think for the rest of the year, we still see the second half of the year in financial services being stronger than the first half of the year which is what we had anticipated. And you see the first part of that happening in Q3.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Good morning guys. How are you?","David Rowland","Good morning, Tien-tsin. How are you?","Tien-tsin Huang","I'm good. Let me ask on the margin side. It looks like gross margin drove the raise in margin guidance. Is that correct? And what would you attribute that to the favorable mix pricing, contracts execution, a little bit bumping up overall?","KC McClure","Yes. Hi, Tien-tsin. As you know, we really do run our business first of all to operating margin. So that's really how we manage the business. And the first thing that we do look at -- within gross margin is, how contract profitability is performing. And overall for both the quarter and for the year, we're happy with our improvement in contract profitability. And that really just all starts with pricing, right. So as we have more and more of our work in the new and in areas where we see strong demand and where we have highly differentiated skills, we do see that we're able to price at a better rate than in other areas. So you'll see that that is part of what's driving our gross margin which is in fact a part -- a big part of driving operating margin.","It's also important to note that even within gross margin, we do have our investments and that's really key for what we're doing. So again that's why we run our business operating margin but from quarter-to-quarter, we are also absorbing investments in our people, in our business, in our gross margin as well.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. That's healthy. Then on top of Ashwin's questions on pushing on bookings just a bit lumpiness there, is it, now to simplify, but is it -- attribute it to just normalization and given the outperformance you saw in the prior quarter and the time required to refill the pipeline then obviously bookings came in quite strong last quarter.","David Rowland","Yes. Tien-tsin let me just jump in because you remember, some may remember this became a little bit of an -- maybe even an unnecessary distraction in quarter one. And just to make sure that maybe we're even more clear on our messaging. So let me just say that we're very, very pleased with the demand environment. So let's be clear on that. That's reflected in our revenue growth year-to-date that's reflected in the revenue growth that we see in the New is reflected. And what we feel is a very strong pipeline position as we closed out the third quarter and that's reflected in our statement and our confidence that we will have strong bookings in the fourth quarter. So to be clear, we're not concerned about bookings, bookings do vary by quarter.","Very often it can be influenced by the timing of when the large deals closed and in the scheme of our big business that we have deals that close in the month of June let's say as opposed to a few weeks early in the month of May. Obviously, that didn't make any difference in the health of our business and what we see from a demand standpoint. So, we're very encouraged by the demand environment. And as KC said the bookings aren't lumpy as they have always been in our business. And I would focus more on the confidence that we have in the fourth quarter than I would, the fact that quarter three was at $10.6 billion.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. Message delivered. Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead guys.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Good morning and congrats on the solid results. I just want to ask about strategy and consulting. I know you in the past had hovered around mid single digits then it bumped up a little bit when the [indiscernible] double digits. And then now, I think it decelerated a tad in mid single digits. So can you just talk a little bit about maybe the ups and downs of that business and the slight deceleration we saw in the quarter?","KC McClure","Yes. Thanks Bryan. So, overall as you mentioned, we do feel good about our business in strategy and consulting. And we do feel good about mid-single-digit growth. And we did have very solid bookings this quarter as well. And as you mentioned the growth will ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. And really as we look at our strategy and consulting business just a reminder that there's really kind of a dual purpose of what we're trying to accomplish there. First of all is just a main objective of the role of delivering strategy and consulting work to our clients.","But then also, it's really to bring as you know the full scope of our end-to-end services. A lot of the overall transformation work and any of the larger scale deals in the pipeline that we may have also led by and brought by our strategy and consulting business. So in that context as we stated before, we see strategy and combined, if it's in the mid, the high single digits and that will ebb and flow by quarter, we think that's [indiscernible] for us.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Helpful. And as a follow up, I want to ask about the acquisition. It sounds like it's been about $1.1 billion capital deployed in acquisitions. Can you just talk about how much you plan to spend in acquisitions as we go into next year, are we still thinking a point or two of acquisitions kind of as a revenue contribution is kind of the right metric to think about?","KC McClure","Yes. Maybe I'll just give some of that financial data and David can talk a little bit more on that. So overall for this fiscal year, we think that we will probably spend based on where we are today very closer to $1.3 billion in acquisitions -- for acquisitions. And overall for this year than we believe based on what we've seen in the pipeline that we have in front of us and the deals we've already closed. We think the revenue for the inorganic revenue contribution this year will be closer to 2% probably closer to 1.5% that we had previously mentioned.","David Rowland","And again, I would say just in terms of how to think about this going forward, our inorganic strategy or our acquisition strategy as we've said through the years really using inorganic as an engine for organic growth that continues to be a focus area for us and that will -- that is a strategic objective will -- is really unchanged as we look forward.","And really if you look at what we've done year-to-date it's -- I'm really pleased with how we've executed that. I think over about 80% of what we've done is focused on the New we've done of course several deals and interactive as I called out, but we've also done deals in both Industry X.0 and applied intelligence. We've also done several deals and Accenture Technology in both our intelligence platform services where we were strengthening our skills and differentiation in a few of the platforms.","And then, we've also done deals to acquire high-end software engineering capabilities again in our intelligence software engineering services. And then to round out as will always be the case we have a handful of bills in the mix that are verticals specific and it's interesting and just as an illustration of the importance to banking and capital markets does over the long haul is an important industry. We've made several investments in banking during this period of time. So this will be an important part of our strategy and you should really expect more of the same as we look forward.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Moffettnathanson. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","Good morning. Question actually on the non-new I guess I'd say looking at performance of some of your peers over the last few months, one of the notable striking observations is that some of the traditional services appear to be deteriorating. So, I'm just hoping you could unpack for us a little bit in the Accenture's non news meaning the other 35% or so. Just remind us a little bit, what exactly is in there and what trends are you seeing in that -- in those traditional services? Thank you.","David Rowland","So, first of all from a business trend standpoint we have -- we really haven't seen a change in the pattern at all. If you were to even -- if you just took the information that we provide you could extrapolate that the 35% is declining, let's say in the single digit range and that's a pattern that we've seen now for some time. And so to be clear all of our growth and this is by design comes from our rotation to the new and the success that we've had in driving those services.","In many ways, we are in some instances -- we're actually accelerating that because we are in the interests of our clients, for example, we're taking some legacy services, I think legacy application maintenance type services and we are introducing new technology to do that work in a more innovative way. And in doing so, you see those legacy services an application maintenance as an example decline, but that is by design. You might say we're cannibalizing ourselves which is in support of our strategy, but we also do it in delivering value to our clients.","The other thing that you have in the New and this is not to say that this is not a comment on market demand, but you do have a lot of -- let's say more traditional classic consulting services would be in the New and while there's still demand for some of those classic consulting services where our real opportunity is and where we're really focusing on our skills capabilities and serving our clients is the strategy and consulting service tied to work that we do in the New. And so the classic services have less focus therefore less growth because we're doing everything rotated to the New.","So hopefully that, really the bottom line is, we really haven't seen any change in the dynamic of the growth rate in the non-new versus the growth in the New. And it's really happening exactly as we intent for our strategy.","Lisa Ellis","Got it. Okay, terrific. Thank you. That's helpful. And maybe a quick one for KC. It looks like attrition picks back up a little bit this quarter. Can you just comment on what you're seeing on the labor front? Thank you.","KC McClure","Yes. So it is an 18%. It's in the range that we have been before. At least that's the overall 18% it's not something that we're concerned about. But I would like to say that within that if I peel back a little bit, I do feel really good and we feel really good about the strong retention rates that we have in the areas that David just talked about a lot of the strategic high growth areas of our business including strategy and consulting as well as many other components of the New. And maybe just to close out as a reminder, we really have no issues getting the talent that we need. We are really quite a magnet for talent based on the strategy that we have. Our financial performance is attractive and overall our talent strategy and the experience that we provide to our people the right workplace and our culture, our strategy, it's really an environment where innovation is at the heart of everything that we do and that's very attractive to many people in the workplace.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thanks. I think it's good to talk to you.","David Rowland","Thanks Lisa.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Koning","Oh, yes. Hey guys. Thank you. And I guess my first question I know in the details you send out the New has been over 60% now for four quarters, the prior seven quarters it's stuffed up every single quarter. And I think you did call it on this call, it's more like 65% now. But is there any reason that that pace of like change into the New seems to maybe be slowing. I know the growth is really good. But is there anything changing at all there?","David Rowland","I don't think there's anything changed. I mean I think you're going to see as we continue to talk about the New in the quarters ahead, I think you're going to see the same type trend line in terms of what it -- how it increases as a percentage of our revenue.","So, I think as we get to the fourth quarter where we typically round the number that we quote externally inside, I think you'll see the typical pattern continue to evolve.","Dave Koning","Okay. Now, that's great. And the other thing just I know it sounds like the environment remains strong and hasn't changed a lot, but the last seven, eight quarters or so have been kind of in the 8% to 11% constant currency. And I think you're kind of guiding 5 to 8 or so in Q4. Is that kind of the typical set the bar to somewhere that's pretty easy to hit and if you execute well you kind of beat that? Or is there something a little different maybe related to the bookings this quarter that you're just trying to be a little more conservative?","KC McClure","Hey Dave. I would say that, I wouldn't characterize our book -- our guidance range is any different in terms of our practice. I mean as you know for the 5% to 8% from Q4, we always tend to aim -- we aim towards the upper end of that range. That's no different than what we have historically done and what we always try to do. And there's not really any difference within because the bookings in Q3 or what we see in Q4, I think it's pretty much our standard way of looking at the quarter and getting the right balance that we believe the revenue expectations we would want to set with all of you.","Dave Koning","Got you. All right. Well, thank you. Good job.","David Rowland","Thank you.","KC McClure","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso","Hi. Thanks for taking my call here. I wanted to ask about non-linear growth with your head count now at 481,000 and it seems like a lot more of the digital world is sort of platforms and non-people based solutions. And if you talk about your investments in that area and where you see it maybe going as a percent of revenue? Thank you.","David Rowland","No. We have talked about that before and at the level that I guess is appropriate for us to talk about in this forum, I will say again that certainly we believe that non-linear growth over time will be more in the mix. You are right that that platform based solutions bringing IP to the table solution aids et cetera which I referenced several in my script are increasingly a bigger part of the services industry and increasingly a bigger part of our differentiation. And so, over time, we will be focused even more. And I'm sure we'll become even better at capturing the value of the IP and the solution aids et cetera that we bring to our clients to deliver services and to deliver value to our clients. The pace at which it happens is harder to predict. We're quite comfortable as we look forward in terms of our ability to manage the SaaS talent organization we have. And as we looked out as you would expect we do over a multiyear horizon there's not anything about the progression of our headcount that that concerns us in terms of executing our business strategy.","So non-linear growth that I think will be more in the mix in the industry and I would expect Accenture would lead the way, but the timing and the slope of the curve I think is still yet to be defined and we'll see how that plays out.","Edward Caso","Okay. Another question, I think in the past you might have given us a view on the FX for the coming fiscal year. I wonder if you could help us out in that department, your initial views on the FX headwind or benefit in FY'20?","KC McClure","Hi, Ed. We won't provide any FY'20 guidance including FX until we get the full FY'20 guidance that we typically do at the end of our fourth quarter.","Edward Caso","Great. Thank you. Congrats.","David Rowland","Thanks Ed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity. Please go ahead.","Rod Bourgeois","Hey, there. Good to talk to you guys. I wanted to ask how you're feeling about the trends and valuations that you're paying for acquisitions, maybe you can talk about how you're performing against your ROI targets, for your average acquisition that you've completed in recent history.","David Rowland","As we've said before, we are very rigorous in tracking our return on our investment for our acquisitions. As a management team we do it very rigorously and we actually review that with the Finance Committee and the Board every quarter. And so, it is a big focus and as I said before we are really pleased with the performance of our portfolio and really have been for the last several years as we really started to ramp up our game in this area. As it relates to valuations in certain areas of the market which well valuations have gotten pretty frothy and we consider that as we do the analysis of [barb] [ph] versus build.","We're not going to be -- we will never be irrational and in overpaying for an asset in the market. But on the other hand, if we also look at things through a strategic lens and we understand that if something has significant strategic value and there's a scarcity of the skill in the marketplace then we make the judgment about paying a little bit more in those instances and there's been instances where we've done that.","So as you would expect of us Rod, we are extremely thoughtful. There are areas like applied intelligence. In the analytic space for example where the valuations are super high, Industry X and in some areas there the valuations are super high. And so, we navigate that within our financial objectives. Again, we have a willingness where it is the right strategic play, but by and large we focus on valuation because we're very return focused in the way we execute our strategy.","Rod Bourgeois","Got it. That makes sense. Just a follow up on the outlook in consulting growth versus outsourcing growth. I was impressed last quarter with the strength in outsourcing growth and it up ticked again this quarter and while consulting slowed a little bit.","So is your outlook for growth in consulting versus outsourcing at a similar clip or do you expect one to look stronger than the other in the next few quarters as you look at what's happening in the pipeline?","KC McClure","I will give you a little bit of color and how we see that playing out in FY'19. So for the fourth quarter, we've been consulting and outsourcing both are going to be about mid to high single digits growth and that would put for the full year both consulting and outsourcing at a high single digit growth range.","Rod Bourgeois","All right. Great. Thank you guys.","David Rowland","Thanks Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman","Thank you. David, thanks for the deep dive on the sensor technology, you had articulated the dimensions of intelligent platforms, intelligent software, engineering and cloud and infrastructure. I was wondering can you help us -- I don't say that intelligent platforms is 40% of revenue, big number. I was wondering can you give us some sense of the sizes of the other two?","David Rowland","I don't think we can communicate that externally. And I don't think I want to do that on this particular call, but we take that point and we have anticipated that we will start to introduce some quantitative numbers behind those parts of our business. But right now it's a little bit premature to do that. But expect that we will do that as we move forward.","James Friedman","So maybe a different direction then, KC you commented in your observations about the operating groups that the platforms which David has described in his prepared remarks. He's populated very well in CMT. Or, you said it was like driver of growth \u2013 software and platforms you said was the driver growth CMT. Can you give us an idea of how we would use the presence of say platforms in the other operating groups, do they over index with any of the other operating groups?","KC McClure","Jamie, thanks for that question because that provides a good opportunity to make sure that we're clear with the use of the word platform maybe so. Platforms that David was talking about that we talk about quite a bit, they are pervasive in all parts of our business all operating groups, all geographies, in all parts of our business dimension. So that's what we talk about when we discuss platforms.","David Rowland","And by the way again in that case when we talk about the platforms, it's the work that we do around SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and Workday and we refer to that as our intelligent platform services business that's the work we do around those platform in that context.","KC McClure","Right. So that's all five of those, and that is pervasive everywhere. When I commented specifically Jamie on CMT; CMT has three industry groups that make up the operating group of CMT. One of which is called software and platforms. So I know that, it\u2019s the use of the platforms name twice, but that's why I specifically called that out within CMT. But most importantly the IPF that David talked about the five platforms that we quantify in IPF, intelligence platform services are pervasive everywhere.","David Rowland","So, on CMT, it was the industry segment reference she was making as a driver of growth.","James Friedman","I got you. Okay. Thanks for the clarification guys.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, good morning guys. So just to clarify on the comment about bookings improving in Q4, do you mean in absolute terms, do you mean the book to bill, do you mean acceleration in year-over-year growth, would it be all the above?","KC McClure","Yes. It's pretty much all the above. I mean mainly I'm focusing on -- in absolute terms, but it would generally be all the above.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Got it. And just on Accenture Interactive, obviously, you mentioned all the deal activity there which is quite interesting, want to see if we can just get an update on how fast that business is growing organically or the annualized revenue run rate of it. I know you've talked about it in some Investor Days in the past. I know you've been getting a little bit bigger on the agency record side there. So just hoping to get a general update qualitatively and quantitatively on that part?","David Rowland","Yes. The last time we saw, it was for FY'18 and it was $8.5 billion. And when you look at this business, this year it has continued to grow strong double-digit growth. And if I pair it the way peer would have said it, I mean very strong double digit growth. So you can think of it as -- is not in the teens but higher than that. And that growth continues. And of course within that as important as the acquisitions are and how we've executed our growth strategy in the context of 8.5 plus billion dollar business the vast, vast, vast majority of that growth of course is organic. And so it is fundamentally an organic driven business where we have used the strategic acquisitions, it's really an igniter if you will of the organic growth and which ultimately led to the scale of 8.5 plus billion dollars.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. I appreciate the comments.","David Rowland","Sure.","Angie Park","Greg, we have time for one more question, and then, David will wrap up the call.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Bryan Bergin","Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow up margin question from earlier. So you\u2019ve had solid performance this year. Can you comment on what's being done differently this year to yield that margin expansion really getting back on track for your model versus last year? Because I think you call that contract profitability earlier, but any other particular factors that are standing out.","KC McClure","Thanks for the question Bryan. We're really focused as I mentioned before on pricing. So we're always focused on pricing and I talked about this a little bit last quarter. That's nothing new, but we continue to really be taking a look at our business in terms of getting the right value for the offerings that we're bringing and pricing out the right way in the marketplace. The benefit, first us, would also as well as make sure that we're doing the right arrangements for our clients. So I think that's really what I would say is the difference that is yielding probably most of the power within our margins is what we're able to do in pricing.","Bryan Bergin","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just to close out here.. Industry X.0, it seems like peers are also emphasizing connected products in IoT with a pick up in recent deals. Can you give us an update just on that business how you see this space, how you feel about the outlook and then any metrics you can share on that business?","David Rowland","I mean it is central to our strategy. We're super excited about the potential and Industry X. We've said that many times before, it is relative to Accenture Interactive which still has a big growth proposition in front of it. X is lower on the maturity curve if you will. And so there's a lot of runway in front of Industry X.0. In many ways it's still relatively immature. But we are working hard to be positioned right at the heart of that wave. And we've and -- we're well positioned now to be a leader in that way. So we're very focused on it. It is a top short list strategic objective and we're excited about the market potential.","Bryan Bergin","Thank you.","David Rowland","All right. Thank you.","David Rowland","Okay. So, thanks again for joining us on today's call. And as you can tell we feel very good about where we are and confident in our ability to finish the year strong. With our highly differentiated capabilities, continued investments across Accenture and disciplined execution of our growth strategy, we're very well-positioned to continue delivering profitable growth and significant value to all of our stakeholders. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. And in the meantime if you have any questions as always please feel free to call Angie and her team and I hope all of you have a great day.

And thanks everyone for joining us today. We had an excellent first quarter and I am extremely pleased with our results. We delivered strong and broad-based revenue growth across all dimensions of our business and gained significant market share once again. Our strategy continues to different Accenture in the marketplace and we are seeing very strong demand for our services, particularly in digital, cloud and security.","Here are few highlights for the quarter.","We delivered very strong new bookings of $10 billion. We generated revenues of was $9.5 billion with 10% growth in local currency. We delivered very strong earnings per share of $1.79, a 13% increase. Operating margin was 15.6%, consistent with the first quarter last year. We generated strong free cash flow of nearly $900 million and we returned more than $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","So, we are off to a strong start in fiscal year 2018 and I feel very good about the continued momentum in our business.","Now, let me handover to David, who will review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Happy holidays to all of you and thanks so much for joining us on today\u2019s call.","Building further on Pierre\u2019s comments, we were very pleased with our quarter one results which positioned us well to achieve our full year business outlook, especially as it relates to our strong and broad-based top-line growth. Once again, these results demonstrate the durability and resiliency of our growth model and the high degree of relevance and differentiation of our capabilities in the marketplace.","Before I get into the details of the quarter, let me summarize a few of the important highlights.","Starting with net revenues. We expanded our business by approximately $1 billion in the quarter, with 10% growth in local currency. The diversity and durability of our growth model was evident with strong and extremely well-balanced growth across all five operating groups and all three geographic areas, with double-digit growth in four operating groups in both Europe and Growth Markets. Strong double-digit growth in digital, cloud and security continued to be the dominant driver of our growth, and it was pervasive across the business. And we estimate that our 10% growth significantly outpaced the market as we continue to gain share and strengthen our position as a leader in the new.","With respect to our profitability. Our operating margin of 15.6% in the quarter was consistent with quarter one of last year, and continues to reflect the significant level of investment in our business. And we delivered very strong EPS of a $1.79, which was up 13% compared to last year.","Looking at cash generation and capital allocation. Our free cash flow of $872 million in the quarter was consistent with our expectations and supports our ongoing objective to invest in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. We invested roughly $130 million, primarily attributed to two acquisitions, and returned approximately $1.4 billion in share repurchases and dividends. And we continue to expect to invest approximately $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in acquisitions during fiscal 2018.","With that said, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings.","New bookings were $10 billion for the quarter, reflecting 19% growth in local currency over last year. Our consulting bookings were $5.9 billion with the book-to-bill of 1.1 and represented an all-time high. Outsourcing bookings were $4 billion with the book-to-bill of 0.9. Once again, our new bookings were well-balanced across the business and we were especially pleased with strong bookings in North America and overall in our strategy and consulting business combined. Strong demand continued for digital, cloud and security, which we estimate represented more than 60% of our new bookings. It\u2019s also noteworthy that we had 13 clients with new bookings in excess of $100 million in the quarter.","Now turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $9.5 billion, a 12% increase in USD and 10% local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange tailwind of roughly 2%. Our net revenues were $170 million above the upper end of our previously guided range, as a result of stronger than expected performance across every dimension of our business. The consulting revenues for the quarter were $5.2 billion, up 13% in USD and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $4.3 billion, up 11% in USD and 9% in local currency.","Looking at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions. Growth was led by application services and operations which both posted double-digit growth. We also saw an uptick in strategy and consulting services combined, which grew mid single digits. And as I mentioned earlier, we continued to deliver strong double-digit growth in digital cloud and security by leveraging the significant investments we\u2019ve made in recent years to build highly differentiated capabilities.","Looking at our operating groups, financial services led this quarter with 11% growth in local currency, reflecting strong growth in both banking and capital markets and insurance. Growth was strong across all three geographies including double-digit growth in Europe and the Growth Markets.","Communications, media and technology grew 10% in the quarter, representing their strongest growth rate in seven quarters, driven by continued strong double-digit growth in software platforms, and we delivered double-digit growth in both North America and the Growth Markets, and we\u2019re particularly pleased with the return to strong growth in Europe.","Products delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth with 10% growth, led by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services as well as industrial. We continue to see strong demand for our services in Europe and the Growth Markets, both of which grew double digits. Resources built further on the momentum established in the second half of last year and delivered a strong quarter at 10% growth.","The highlight of the quarter continued to be strong double-digit growth in chemicals and natural resources, and we were also pleased with continued signs of stabilization in energy, resulting in positive growth in the quarter.","Finally, H&PS grew 8%, reflecting significant improvement over growth rates in fiscal 2017. We saw strong growth in both health and public service, led by double-digit growth in both Europe and the Growth Markets, and strong growth in North America.","Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1%, consistent with the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared with 10.4% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 5.9% compared to 6% for the same quarter last year.","Operating income was $1.5 billion for the first quarter, reflecting 15.6% operating margin, consistent with quarter one last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared with an effective tax rate of 20.4% for the first quarter last year.","Diluted earnings per share were $1.79 compared with EPS of $1.58 in the first quarter last year, and again, this reflects a 13% year-over-year increase.","Days services outstanding were 43 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 44 days in the first quarter of last year.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $872 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1 billion net of property and equipment additions of a $133 million. Our cash balance at November 30th was $3.7 billion compared with $4.1 billion at August 31st.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4 million shares for $563 million at an average price of $139.69 per share. At November 30th, we had approximately $2.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.33 per share for a total of $854 million. This represented a $0.12 per share or 10% increase of dividend we paid in May.","So in summary, we\u2019re very pleased with our quarter one results and we\u2019re off to a good start in fiscal 2018.","Now, let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David.","Our very strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute our strategy very well and are clearly benefited from the substantial investments we have made to build differentiated services and further enhance our competitiveness.","I am especially pleased with our continued rotation to the new digital, cloud and security, which again grew at a very strong double-digit rate this quarter. We have been particularly successful with Accenture Digital, nearly tripling the annual revenue from this business since we launched it four years ago. And we have expanded our capabilities to help our clients with their digital transformations.","Now, given the increasing importance of artificial intelligence, automation, machine learning and other innovative technologies, we are evolving Accenture Digital to be even more relevant to our clients and drive even greater differentiation in the marketplace. Going forward, Accenture Digital will be focused on three big areas, Accenture Interactive; Accenture Industry X.0; and Accenture Applied Intelligence. Let me bring this to life for you.","We\u2019ll start Accenture Interactive, which is all about serving the CMO and the marketing function, helping the world\u2019s leading brands transform the customer experience. We are working with Maserati to do just that across all of its channels, leveraging our expertise in data-driven marketing, digital analytics, and creative services. We are also strengthening our end-to-end marketing capabilities for CMOs by investing to scale intelligent marketing operations. This capability, which is part of Accenture operations combines platforms, analytics and artificial intelligence to run marketing campaigns as a seamless managed service.","Second, Accenture Industry X.0 focuses on the digital reinvention of manufacturing and production, helping clients create smart, connected products and services, using advanced technologies including the Internet of Things, connected devices, and digital platform. A great example is that we are partnering with Schneider Electric to create a Digital Services Factory to build and scale new services in predictive maintenance, asset monitoring, and energy optimization. By combining real time analytics with collected technologies on an IoT platform, we are helping anticipate customer needs and reducing the time to launch new services at scale by 80%. And to give our clients hands-on experience, we are opening industrial IoT innovation centers including one near Munich where we\u2019re working with clients to design and prototype digital solutions that will improve engineering, manufacturing and production. We plan to open new centers soon in the U.S. and Asia.","The third area, Accenture Applied Intelligence brings together the capability to building advanced analytics and artificial intelligence. Increasingly, we are embedding artificial intelligence into the core of our clients\u2019 businesses across every function and process.","And given our technology independence, Accenture holds a unique position in the tech ecosystem. And we are working with all the leading providers of artificial intelligence technologies including Microsoft, SAP, Google and Amazon to bring the best solutions to our clients.","We are working with a leading European insurance company to use analytics and artificial intelligence to understand what their customers want and deliver a personalized experience. Our solution across marketing, claims processing and customer service is enhancing customer loyalty and making a significant bottom-line impact. We also continue to invest in this area with our acquisition of Search Technologies to expand our expertise in big data and enterprise search; and our investment in Pactera [ph] which helps companies generate value from data more quickly.","Of course, we continue to work with clients on their largest and most complex transformation programs, delivering services end-to-end across our five businesses to drive business outcomes. With Marriott International, we are working at the heart of one of their most important business imperatives, the integration of Starwood, including the massive data migration. We\u2019re also leveraging key elements of our innovation architecture to help Marriott achieve its goal to enhance the travel experience and accelerate growth. And today, we are very proud to be a flagship innovation partner for Marriott.","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I am very pleased that we delivered strong revenue growth in all three of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered 7% growth in local currency, driven by the United States. In Europe, we had another excellent quarter with growth of 11% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in Germany, France and Italy as well as high single-digit growth in Spain. And I am extremely pleased with our development in growth markets where we delivered 16% growth in local currency, led once again by very strong double-digit growth in Japan as well as double-digit growth in Australia, Singapore and Brazil.","Before I turn it back to David, I want to mention that the digital capabilities we\u2019ve built along with our highly differentiated talent in the new are absolutely key to the successful execution of our strategy. That is why I am pleased we continue receive recognition by industry analysts in key areas ranging from the strength of our execution capabilities in digital strategy and consulting to our digital experience services in design, content and co-innovation, and for our overall market leadership in digital services.","I am also pleased Accenture was recognized by Fortune as a company changing the world and by JUST Capital for our leadership in environmental sustainability and in the training and development of our people.","I truly believe Accenture is a magnet for top talent in the new, not only because of the work we do for clients but because our culture supports employee who want to make a difference in the community where we live and work.","So, with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre.","Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenues to be in the range of $9.15 billion to $9.4 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 4.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2018, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be positive 2.5% compared to fiscal 2017. For the full fiscal 2018, we now expect our net revenues to be in the range of 6% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal 2017.","For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2018 to be 14.9% to 15.1%, a 10 to 30 basis-point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2017 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. This range does not include the impact from the U.S. tax legislation.","Before I move on, let me add some additional comments on our view of the new tax legislation. Our current assessment is that we do expect to record a non-cash expense in fiscal 2018 which could be up to $500 million to reflect the impact of lower tax rates on our U.S. deferred tax assets. Beyond this expense, we expect the impact to our fiscal 2018 tax rate to be minimum.","For earnings per share, adjusting for the updated net revenues, FX and tax assumptions, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $6.48 to $6.66 or 10% to 13% growth over adjusted fiscal 2017 results.","For the full fiscal 2018, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion.","Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.","With that said, let\u2019s open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?","Angie Park","Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Kevin, would you provide instructions for those on the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Hey. Good morning, Tien-Tsin. ","Tien-Tsin Huang","Good morning to you. Very strong results here. I guess, I\u2019ll hone in on the consulting book-to-bill metric; like you said, it\u2019s the highest you\u2019ve seen. Wouldn\u2019t that imply acceleration for the consulting segment here, in the short to mid-term? Maybe you can update us on that and just growth across consulting and outsourcing, and if that\u2019s changed for the fiscal year?","David Rowland","Yes. I mean, let me start by saying that we are very, very pleased with our consulting bookings, obviously in the first quarter. We do see good momentum in the business. We\u2019re pleased with our pipeline. And in fact, if you look at our bookings overall, we expect to have another strong bookings quarter in quarter two. So, if you look at momentum really, broadly across our business including consulting but not limited to consulting, we are very, very positive.","Perhaps your question really was getting at therefore why didn\u2019t we raise guidance further, perhaps? And on one hand, we have a lot of reasons to be optimistic. We clearly see momentum in our business, but on the other hand it\u2019s just one quarter in the books. And as we normally do, we want to have a little bit more visibility to the full year before we significantly change guidance. We feel obviously very comfortable. We\u2019re taking the low end of the previous guided range off the table. And we will see where we end in quarter two. And at that point, we will reevaluate the upper end of the range. But overall, very comfortable with our business and feel very good about the momentum.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Got it. That makes perfect sense. Just my quick follow-up, then I\u2019ll just ask you obligatory question around acquisitions and the contribution to revenue or even bookings, if you have that in the quarter from acquisitions?","David Rowland","Okay. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. For the full year, our view of acquisitions hasn\u2019t changed. We expect the revenue contribution, the inorganic to be in the 2.5 to 3% range. Now, that will be heavier or higher in the first half of the year where in the first half of the year, the impact is in the 3 to 3.5% range; and certainly, in the first quarter, let\u2019s say it was probably more toward the upper end of that 3 to 3.5% range. And then, in second half of the year, it will be lower in the 2 to 2.5% range. So, 2.5 to 3 for the full year, higher in H1, a little bit lower in H2.","We continue to focus obviously on acquisitions as an essential part of our strategy. We did have a lower level of acquisitions in the first quarter. There is nothing you should read into that, is driven by market dynamics and the timing and kind of lumpiness of the way the pipeline evolves in acquisitions. We continue to focus on investing 1.1 to $1.4 billion this year, heavily focused on the new and acquiring critical capabilities to further support that part of our business, which is growing at such a high rate.","Operator","Our next question is from the line Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys and happy holidays as well. Just looking at strategy and consulting. That was kind of a key segment that we saw last year kind of decline through the year and I think it was flat in the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis and then, it\u2019s bounced back here to mid single digits. Also, I heard positive bookings comments about strategy and consulting. So, maybe you can just talk about a little bit on the turn here we\u2019ve seen in strategy and consulting?","David Rowland","Yes. Let me make a comment or two, and then Pierre may want to add some comments or not, depending on what I say. So, first of all, let me just remind you. When we had this discussion last year, we noted for the group that all of our businesses are subject to going through ebbs and flows and cycles. We commented on the fact that in fiscal 2015 and 2016, we had consistent double-digit growth in consulting and strategy services combined. We mentioned last year that application services and operations were very hot.","And we also talked about the fact that our strategy and consulting practitioners really play two roles. One role is to serve our clients and delivering strategy and consulting services specifically. But the other role is to really bring the full scope of Accenture services and offerings to the client. So, they have a dual role of both selling the full suite of Accenture\u2019s capability to drive transformation, as well as let\u2019s say business-specific service.","So, in that context, as we indicated, these parts of our business can go through kind of natural ebbs and flows. We\u2019re at a point in time now, where if you look at the transformation that a lot of industries just continue to go through, if you look at the high level of growth in the new, we\u2019re at a point where the convergence, the factors were such the demand for those services, which is higher in quarter one, it was fairly broad-based and it was heavily focused on the new. In fact, the growth rate for consulting and strategy in the new was much higher than the average growth rate of mid-single-digits that I commented on.","Pierre, let me just see if there is anything you\u2019d want to add to that.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, sure. Complementing to just what you said, I clearly see three main drivers for strategy and consulting growth. I think of course the number one is pretty obvious is there is a strong and stronger demand around digital strategies and digital transformations in all industries and across the world. And number two, there is still the same appetite today for rationalization. You know what is this [ph] around the evolution of the industries; digitalization is on one hand, rationalization on the other hand. In terms of rationalization as administration, we have great success with our, what we call, BBZ, budget base zero kind of approach, which is all about rationalizing operations and cost to make our client more effective. And three, it is a clear rebound in what I would call the platform business. And by platform, I\u2019m thinking about SAP, I\u2019m thinking about Microsoft, I\u2019m thinking about Salesforce.com as an illustration. Clearly, their new platforms, cloud-enabled are creating demand for our technology services, but as well are driving demand for consulting services, because you have to significantly transform the organization as well as the processes.","Bryan Keane","Just one quick follow-up. When thinking about the 10% constant currency revenue growth rate, I know that\u2019s up from 8% constant currency last quarter. Just trying to think about the two big dimensions. Did the new growth portion accelerate that cause that acceleration or did just the core growth business improve? Thanks so much.","David Rowland","The primary driver of our growth in the quarter continues to be the new. So, the big story continues to be underpinning that 10% is just very, very strong growth in the new.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","So, can you guys comment on -- as you\u2019re now in the close of the calendar year and you\u2019re doing your discussions for calendar 2018 with clients, what the underlying growth rate is looking like in their overall IT budgets? I mean, we talk a lot about the shift into the new. But, I am curious what the dynamic is with overall growth. I highlight that just because in our recent CIO surveys, we\u2019re actually seeing a material uptick in actually overall budget growth. I am curious if you guys are sort of seeing a similar thing as you look into calendar 2018?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. Thanks Lisa for your question. And indeed, I\u2019ve been reading carefully the report you provided regarding your CIO survey. And I could only describe to the conclusion you\u2019ve made from this survey, indeed there is an increase in the budget. But, as you know, the investments -- I mean, they continue to shift from the legacy to the new to use our own terminology. And on the legacy, the demand is still around rationalizing the application and rationalizing the infrastructure, which is creating a good demand on our cloud services administration or good demand as well and we have results this year on our application outsourcing business, which is part of our application services. And indeed, we see a shift of the budget to digital technologies at large, including the digital technologies in the IT shelf but I would extend to the digital technology in the marketing budget as well. And all of this is increasing, as I think we\u2019re moving in digital from what I would qualify these last couple of years, the proliferation of the POC, the proof-of-concept. So, the prototypes that have been proliferating across the different organizations; and now we are moving to the industrialization of the deployment of the digital capabilities. And of course, it\u2019s creating strong demand to Accenture services because we organize our capabilities exactly to support the industrialization of digital services.","Lisa Ellis","Perfect, thank you. And then, David, my follow up is for you. Could you give a little color on the free cash flow numbers? I just noticed those are -- actually free cash flow is a little bit down year-on-year, quarter-to-quarter and also your guidance for the year and the midpoint of the guidance is -- doesn\u2019t have growth year-on-year, despite the strong earnings growth outlook?","David Rowland","Yes. I mean, as I said, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particular to point out on our free cash flow guidance. The first quarter played out pretty much exactly as we had expected. It\u2019s typical that we have an uptick in DSO in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, and that played out as expected in the range that we had expected. And we continue to track well for our free cash flow for the full year. Again, one of the things that you know Lisa we comment on is the relationship between free cash flow and net income. And our free cash flow range continues to indicate that we have a model where the free cash flow exceeds our net income. So, we feel very good about it. I mean, we work hard every day on DSOs and other aspects of our cash flow to try to land as high in the range as possible. But, we feel good about the range that we started here with and reconfirmed just few minutes ago.","Lisa Ellis","Okay, cool. Yes. I just wanted to know if there were no specific call outs, all right. Thank you. ","David Rowland","Yes. All right. Thank you, Lisa. ","Operator","Thank you. And next we have Moshe Katri, Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Moshe Katri","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Can we talk a bit about digital, cloud and platforms? I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s north of 50% of revenues. Maybe some color in that. And you did indicate double-digit growth, maybe some more color on that. Is growth accelerating or are we still at the same level that we\u2019ve seen a year maybe two years ago? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. I\u2019m very pleased to comment on this. I mean, first, what we\u2019re calling the new digital, cloud, security services; you added platforms, I\u2019m fine with that. We see continued momentum in the services we have built these last few years, interactive, what we call mobility, analytics, cloud and security. This is very strong and we continue to enjoy a good growth.","But, in addition, we don\u2019t stand still. And this is what I wanted to communicate, especially in this call to all of you is the new ways of digital technologies and innovations are coming extremely rapidly. And so, what we wanted to make sure we stay ahead of the curve and so we could provide to our clients at scale, the services in these new technologies, and that\u2019s why we are launching these three new services that are going to join Accenture Digital. I\u2019m thinking about Accenture Applied Intelligence, so bringing the artificial intelligence and machine learning on top of our existing analytics business. So, the analytics business had a good momentum, and we are adding artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate this momentum and accelerate growth.","We\u2019re doing a very similar thing by the creation of Accenture Industry X.0 where we\u2019re bringing the new capabilities we\u2019ve developed in terms of engineering, production on the internet manufacturing, if you will, around the digital manufacturing platforms and all the IoT and connected devices world to again sustain and accelerate our momentum in that space. And the last one is around what we\u2019re calling intelligent marketing campaign in Accenture Interactive. Again, Accenture Interactive has an excellent momentum as we speak in the existing services, mainly design, content production and commerce production as well. And we are adding intelligent marketing operations. So, we are adding on top of the good momentum an accelerator, if you will with the new capabilities we are launching. So, I\u2019m very comfortable that we will continue to drive excellent double-digit growth in this part of our business.","David Rowland","And if I could just add -- let me just add one comment just on the quantitative side and call out that our revenues in the new now represent approximately 55% of our total revenue stream. One of the things that Pierre and I were looking at yesterday is -- and of course, we have been managing this for many quarters now is just how pervasive that is across our business. I mean, literally, every industry, every geographic market, you see a level of rotation to the new that is let\u2019s say in the range of 50% or higher and 55% overall. And I think that that\u2019s important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that supports an essential element of our strategy which is to create durability and resiliency in our revenue. And that\u2019s an illustration, one illustration of how our model is working to do that.","Moshe Katri","Thanks. And just as a follow-up to this. Our surveys are talking about the fact or indicating the fact that average project sizes in this area are starting to pretty much scale and increase pretty significantly, just given the fact that we\u2019re getting to a point where you are saying your typical enterprise buyer kind of connecting the front end to the back end legacy backbone systems. Are you seeing that as well? And obviously, from your perspective that could be kind of a multi-year phase as well.","Pierre Nanterme","No doubt the digital projects are getting bigger and they are getting bigger, just consistent with the transition, as mentioned before. We had this space where clients were investing in smaller projects that qualified in terms of prototyping or proof-of-concept type of projects, testing the thing. Now, we\u2019ve passed that phase where we have evidence that the digital transformation is driving growth and value for the different industries and clients are shifting to industrialize the digital capabilities. You\u2019ve seen more and more the creation of what we\u2019re calling or clients are calling digital factories, digital hub. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing with Schneider Electric, illustrated a few minutes ago. So, the projects are getting bigger in average as digital technologies are maturing and are scaling. So, it\u2019s a very good trend. And of course, it is supporting double-digit growth in digital- related services.","Operator","Thank you. And next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois, DeepDive Equity.","David Rowland ","Hello, Rod. How are you?","Rod Bourgeois","Hey, doing fine. Thanks very much. Hey, I wanted to talk a little bit about -- the growth definitely came in strong; I want to talk about the margins for a second. Your operating margin was equal to the year-ago quarter. But I know there is a lot of moving parts underneath that margin result, particularly since you\u2019re reporting a gap margin and essentially absorbing all of those acquisition investments. So, can you share the main puts and takes on your margin trend when you compare this year to last year? And I want to know, are there certain underlying factors that are meaningful headwinds year-to-year and certain factors that are meaningful tailwinds?","David Rowland","Okay, great. Very good question. So, first of all is -- I think you started with -- let me just again say that our operating margin can in fact vary quarter-to-quarter. That\u2019s the typical pattern in our business for a variety of reasons. Let me also reiterate that irrespective of what our margin was in quarter one which we were pleased with, we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re on the trajectory of delivering 10 to 30 basis points of expansion for the full year while also meeting on our management objective which is to invest at significantly higher levels than the rate of our revenue growth and then covering that by real underlying expansion in our margin. As it relates to quarter one, there are probably two or three things that I would point out, none of which are too much of a surprise in terms of a normal flow of our business.","The first thing, I would highlight is that quarter one of last year was an extremely strong quarter for us. You may remember, Rod, that quarter one of last year, we reported 40 basis points of expansion. And so, some of what you say in our first quarter result is -- compare against a very strong quarter last year.","I think if I was to just point two other things in our results in the first quarter. One thing is, as you alluded to and I confirmed, we did have a very high level of investments flow through our P&L in the first quarter, which I think you and others would expect, given many reasons including the $1.7 billion of acquisitions that we invested in last year. And I would say in general, our investments are probably on balance higher in the first half of the year this year than the second half of the year.","The other thing that we called out is that we did see some of our operating groups had lower consulting contract profitability. But again, as you know as well, our contract profitability ebbs and flows at different points in time in our business. And we expect that consulting contract profitability improves as we progress through the year. So, those are some things, I would say, the tough, the higher compares. So really, I would say, we delivered a consistent level of very high profitability that we reported quarter one last year. And the rate of investment growth was much higher than the rate of revenue growth.","Rod Bourgeois","On a somewhat related note, I want to ask about your trend in your sole-source business. In our research, we\u2019re seeing some reasons for sole-source activity to increase, but some other factors that could put some pressure on that. So, I\u2019d love to know, when you net all the trends together, what\u2019s the net impact on sole-source signings activity kind of on a weighted average basis across your business. So, can you say where your sole-source percentage is now and whether it\u2019s heading up or down?","David Rowland","Yes. I mean, we have had -- we track this every quarter. And frankly, we have an amazing level of consistency in the sole-source deals as a percentage of the total. It continues to run in the range of about 70%. So, really, Rod, we\u2019ve seen -- we haven\u2019t seen a significant change in that pattern. I think, Pierre, you wanted to add something.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. I\u2019m going to give some color on this, because it\u2019s giving me the opportunity to give you an information we didn\u2019t match in the script. When you talk about sole-source, I think it does relate to the quality and the deepness of the trusted relationships we have developed with our clients over many, many years. And I\u2019m very pleased to share with all this group that we have now 169 diamond clients. I am mentioning this number, because many of you know how important are these diamond clients in the Accenture\u2019s strategy including in the economic model. It\u2019s a record high of diamond clients at Accenture, 169, including the best brands across all the world and the deepness and the kind of relationship we\u2019ve been developing for many, many years are as well driving these sole-source projects, because sole-source projects are directly correlated to the trust and the confidence our clients are putting in Accenture.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Good morning. So, I just wanted to start with a question on digital, which obviously is the biggest part of the new. We have estimated that the Interactive business might be upwards of maybe half of digital. So, any commentary around that? And just a general update on the growth trajectory of Interactive and the competitive positioning you see there versus the digital and the traditional ad agencies as the lines continue to blur there? I would love to hear about that?","Pierre Nanterme","I couldn\u2019t be more pleased to comment on Accenture Interactive, which I would qualify as a darling of Accenture. And I want to take this opportunity to recognize Brian Whipple for the amazing job he has been doing in providing leadership on Accenture Interactive. And Accenture Interactive has been creating not long ago and as you know, for two years in the row, we have been ranked as the leading company in digital marketing by Advertising Age in terms of size, in terms of growth. We have an amazing momentum. I was very pleased to announce in my presentation that we are now the agency of record for Maserati. It means something for us because it means that indeed we are now a key player in the agency world. We are gaining massive market share. We are becoming certainly a leader in digital marketing solutions. And we have three major segments so far in Accenture Interactive, all the digital design was filled, all the digital content production. And you will remember that some years ago we acquired a company called avVenta being the basis for that. And in all commerce, e-commerce solutions with Acquity. You\u2019ll remember an acquisition made in the U.S., and very pleased with the acquisition of Altima we made in France as well, which is going to boost our equity -- digital equity business. And we are adding now this intelligent marketing campaign where we\u2019re going to analytics and artificial intelligence. So that\u2019s the kind of fourth growth engine we are adding in Accenture Interactive. And so, I am extremely comfortable that we will continue to gain market share and to grow significantly with Accenture Interactive.","And I am very pleased by the way that to lead our intelligent marketing campaign, we are going to welcome a very prominent and iconic leader from the industry Nikki Mendon\u00e7a who is going to join Accenture soon to lead that business. So, couldn\u2019t be more pleased.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, terrific. So, Accenture along with pretty much everyone else in the space is seeing this real bifurcation in growth between the new versus the legacy service offerings. And I am just wondering, if you guys think that that may lead to some acceleration in industry consolidation perhaps including larger deals and not just tuck-ins that have been more of the norm across the industry in recent years?","Pierre Nanterme","It\u2019s a good question. So, let me start by -- I\u2019m going to talk for David on this because David has got a very strong point of view on the topic and always telling me that the big transaction in professional services fails at 100%, which is quite a significant percentage if you will. So, are we going to see that? I don\u2019t know. This is not our game at Accenture. Our game is to drive organic growth on top of acquisition of very specific companies with very specific and differentiated capabilities. And then, what Accenture is offering to these companies we\u2019re acquiring is our unique access to the best brands in the world and our unique geographic footprint; that\u2019s the combo we\u2019re bringing. You imagine, when these companies are joining Accenture with access to 169 diamond clients the best brands in the world. So, I tend to trust David, I always trust David. 100% of the big transaction in professional services and consolidation fail.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Well, trusting David has worked so far. So, you might as well -- happy holidays, guys.","David Rowland","You should always trust David. It\u2019s the best year for the industry.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks, enjoy.","David Rowland","Hey, Jason. Thanks for teeing that up. ","Jason Kupferberg","Anytime.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Brian Essex, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","David Rowland","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Essex","Good morning. Thank you for taking the call and happy holidays from me as well. There is a lot of conversation about the new, certainly worth highlighting. I was wondering if maybe I could follow on a question I think that Bryan had asked. We\u2019ve seen some better than expected results, particularly recently from traditional on-premise hardware vendors. Kind of driving the debate for on-premise workflow computing environment, and what\u2019s going on in that space. What are seeing -- are you seeing stabilization in the core as stabilization within legacy contracts as well or do you have any insight into what\u2019s going on there, or do you view that as maybe an anomaly in the market?","Pierre Nanterme","What I can share with you is indeed our view on this platform\u2019s market. As you know, we are working with all the major players in the ecosystem, I mean think about SAP, or I call Microsoft, Salesforce.com, Workday to mention a few. If you take what probably you\u2019d call the legacy players and not the -- I mean, the cloud native [ph] such as Salesforce.com and Workday, there are kind of periods, especially SAP and Oracle, of pause where they were facing this transition from on-premise to cloud-enabled platforms. And then what you\u2019ve been seeing is that put the act together in a very strong way. And if you take just SAP, they launched S\/4HANA and then on top of HANA their in-memory analytics tools, they are putting now Leonardo, which is bringing more intelligent and artificial intelligence on top of it. And all of this now is cloud enabled and you heard that partnership between SAP and Azure to provide the SAP solution on the cloud. And now, this is what we\u2019ve seen in our services that our services on these platforms are growing significantly. And so, to a great extent, I don\u2019t believe that there is anymore -- the terminology of legacy players. I think they\u2019ve been able to transition in the new and now they could compete in cloud ERP solution, likewise the Salesforce.com or the Workday. So, I\u2019m very impressed with the rotation they\u2019ve been driving in their business to move from on-promise legacy to cloud as a service business.","Brian Essex","Great. And then, maybe if I could touch on, as a follow-up on a question that Lisa I think has asked with regard to budgets. I mean, our CIO surveys also pointed to better spend next year but that was a 3Q survey that was prior to tax reform. Are you having any -- or do you have an incremental color for next year, if there is any sensitivity to lift from reform and potential upside to what you\u2019ve initially had in terms of conversations with your customers?","Pierre Nanterme","No, I can mention. I mean there are many analysts who have been providing information as well as you are driving CIO surveys and they are all very consistent that the budget would increase with the shift from legacy to digital. But for me, to be honest, with 10 billion bookings in Q1, it would be hard not to acknowledge there is a demand out there. ","Angie Park","Kevin, we have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you. That question is from the line of David Grossman, Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.","David Grossman","David, sorry if I missed this, but I think you mentioned the tax reform had minimal impact on fiscal 2018 EPS. Can you provide us with any parameters that may help us understand the potential impacts of tax reform beyond this fiscal year?","David Rowland","Yes. So, just to I guess to reconfirm, to ensure I was clear in the remarks I made in the script. Again, we expect our tax rate this year again to be in the 22 to 24% range. And that does not include the impact of the U.S. tax legislation. Again, our current assessment is that the impact on the effective tax rate will be minimal, other than a non-cash expense for fiscal 2018, which could be up to 500 million which reflects the impact of lower tax rates on our U.S. deferred tax assets. I didn\u2019t say it in the script but let me also add that we do not expect an impact on our tax cash payments this year. So, having said that, over time, on an ongoing basis the legislation could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. And so, the specific answer to your question beyond what I said about 2018 is that on an ongoing basis, we think it could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate. And essentially, you\u2019ve got the lower rate, which is let\u2019s say offset essentially or closely offset by the loss of certain deductions and then the other thing in the mix as well is the tax imposed on intercompany transactions. But, in the mix, we see a modest impact over time.","David Grossman","So, that\u2019s the modest impact, plus or minus, is that up?","David Rowland","I would say more likely a modest upward pressure than downward.","David Grossman","Got it. Great. Thanks for that. And just one very quick follow-up. So just in addition to -- you\u2019ve done a great job of using acquisitions to accelerate your ability to reach scale change in the marketplace. So, if in fact that\u2019s an accurate observation, given that the guidance for a slower pace of acquisition for this year, should we assume that your recruiting and training infrastructure is now at a point that you can better satisfy in market demand or are there other dynamics that play in that equation?","David Rowland","I would say that -- I wouldn\u2019t -- I understand that if you just look at it purely numerically, you would say that we have a lower rate of acquisitions. I wouldn\u2019t say that -- what I would say is that this year\u2019s estimate of 1.1 to 1.4 is entirely consistent with our strategic objective. It just so happens that last year, the nature of the opportunities in the marketplace was such that we went above what would be our typical strategic range. That could happen at any time in the future. So, it\u2019s not a slowdown as much as it was last year; it was just above our strategic range. And this year, we\u2019re guiding 1.1 to 1.4 which is right consistent with our strategic objective and we\u2019ll see how the year plays out.","Pierre Nanterme","All right. I think it\u2019s time right Angie to wrap up the call. Thanks again for joining us on today\u2019s call. So, in closing and with the first quarter now behind us, as you probably heard from David and I, we feel very good about where we are. And I\u2019m personally confident that we are well-positioned to continue gaining market share, driving profitable growth and delivering value for both our clients and all our stakeholders. I want to wish you, our investors and analysts and everyone at Accenture a very happy holiday season and all the best for the New Year. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any question, as always, please feel free to call Angie and the team. All the best. Happy New Year. Talk to you next year.","Operator","Thank you.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accenture's First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Ms. KC McClure. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2013 earnings announcement. As Tom just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call.  Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. Pam will then provide our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013, and then we'll take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues.","Some of the matters we'll discuss in this call are forward looking, including the business outlook. You should keep in mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, and that such statements are not a guarantee of our future performance. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the Risk Factor section of our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures where appropriate to GAAP, in our news release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our results for the first quarter, which were in line with our expectations and demonstrate that we continue to deliver value to our clients and to run our business with discipline. This is enabling us to drive profitable growth despite a continued volatile economic environment.","Here are a few highlights. We delivered solid new bookings of $7.5 billion. Revenues were $7.2 billion, up 5% in local currency. We are particularly pleased with our double-digit revenue growth in outsourcing, up 13%. Earnings per share were $1.06, up 10%. We expanded operating margin more than 60 basis points to 14.5%.","We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $5.7 billion. And we continued to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and payment of a semiannual cash dividend of $0.81 per share, a 20% increase over our prior dividend.","So we are off to a good start in fiscal year '13 and are raising our outlook for both EPS and operating margin for the full year.","Now I'll hand over to Pam, who will review the numbers in greater detail. Pam, over to you.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre. Happy holidays, and thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased to tell you more about Accenture's fiscal '13 first quarter financial results, which as Pierre just mentioned, are starting us off well for the year. Overall, our growth in revenues was driven by double-digit growth, both in outsourcing and geographically in the Americas. We also achieved double-digit growth in our earnings per share as we continue to drive our business with a strong focus on profitable growth.","Now let's get to the numbers for the first quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP except the items that are not part of the financial statements or that are calculations. New bookings for the quarter were $7.5 billion and reflected a negative 2% foreign exchange impact compared with the new bookings in the first quarter last year. This was what we expected after Q4 bookings of $9.2 billion, and we have replenished our opportunity pipeline to be well positioned for bookings in future quarters. Consulting bookings were $4.2 billion, and outsourcing bookings were $3.3 billion.","Let me give you some bookings details, starting with consulting. In management consulting, bookings were lower this quarter, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific but were up in the United States. Business demand continues to be strongest in operations, customer relationship management and talent and organization.","Technology bookings were up and reflected continued strong demand from our clients looking to capture greater business value from IT. We saw a number of transformational projects this quarter in workplace enablement, desktop transformation and data center consolidations, as well as projects in infrastructure consulting, IT strategy and security.","System integration bookings are holding their own from a book-to-bill perspective and reflect continued demand to modernize and upgrade core ERP, as well as more demand for industry-specific systems across the major platforms. Emerging technologies continue to gain momentum as we are helping clients integrate Software-as-a-Service\/cloud, mobility and digital interactive solutions.","Turning to outsourcing. Our bookings in technology outsourcing were down a bit after our strong fourth quarter bookings, yet reflect good demand across our operating groups and geographically across the Americas, Asia Pacific and parts of Europe and Africa. Our clients are seeking immediate cost savings and reliable performance in addition to flexibility and talent at scale to meet their dynamic IT needs from legacy to emerging and to help them transform their operations to drive more competitive levels of IT and business performance.","BPO bookings in Q1 were lumpy compared to the record level of Q4. They reflect continued demand for our cross-industry offerings, especially finance and accounting, as well as procurement and for our industry-specific solutions in resources, products and financial services. Finally, we had bookings of over $100 million at 7 clients, with all 5 operating groups represented.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the first quarter were $7.22 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency over the same period last year. Pretty close to the outlook of negative 3% FX we provided last quarter, these revenues reflected a foreign exchange impact of negative 3.4% compared with Q1 last year and were in the middle of our guided range of $7.1 billion to $7.35 billion.","Consulting revenues were $3.96 billion, down 3% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. We had single-digit local currency growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and we're down modestly in local currency in EMEA. We are experiencing changes in consulting demand patterns, and we see variability across our broad footprint by geography, industry and type of consulting work.","We continue to see an increase in large transformation consulting projects, which are converting to revenue at a slower pace. In addition, we've seen a near-term decline in small and medium-sized consulting projects, particularly in EMEA. These patterns, net-net, have resulted in flat consulting revenue growth this quarter, and we expect this to continue through next quarter.","Outsourcing revenues were $3.26 billion, an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. We saw a strong double-digit growth in local currency in the Americas and Asia Pacific and single-digit growth in local currency in EMEA.","And let me give you some highlights of our revenue growth in the operating groups. Health & Public Service revenues increased 13% in local currency, reflecting very strong growth in Health again this quarter, with strengths in both consulting and outsourcing and across the 3 geographic regions. Our investments in Health continue to pay off in market tick-up. We had good demand in Public Service this quarter, driven by very significant growth in Asia Pacific and growth in the Americas. Key drivers were our human services and operations and management offerings.","Financial Services revenues increased 9% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, driven primarily in the Americas across all industry groups, particularly in Credit Services where we made an acquisition last year, and in insurance. Consulting revenues grew slightly, driven by capital markets and insurance, and this growth was partially offset by a slight consulting decline in banking.","The Products operating group had local currency revenue growth of 5%, driven by very strong growth in outsourcing globally in both technology and BPO. From an industry perspective, overall revenue growth was led by retail and life sciences in all regions. Revenue in consumer goods declined as we are going through a cycle of near completion on large-scale ERP work at a few large clients. The Americas grew double digits, with EMEA and APAC flat year-over-year, as strong outsourcing growth was offset by a decline in consulting for those 2 regions.","Resources revenues grew 3% in local currency, with outsourcing growth, particularly in energy, reflecting client demand to reduce ongoing support costs while increasing flexibility to meet operational priorities.","In consulting, revenue was flat as growth in chemicals, driven by ERP work, was offset by declines in utilities and natural resources. Some clients, primarily in utilities and natural resources, have lowered their spend, a trend we expect to continue in the near term.","Communications, Media & Technology revenues decreased 1% in local currency. Outsourcing continued to grow, driven by our clients' focus on improving the efficiency of operations. CMT's consulting revenue declined in all 3 regions. This was most pronounced in EMEA and in Communications globally where the trend of certain clients deferring investments in core capabilities for traditional markets continued. There was significant Consulting growth in high tech in the Americas as clients increase their focus on building and improving systems for managing customer relationships. In the emerging markets, there is renewed system integration activity to build core capabilities on new platforms.","In summary, the revenue we delivered in Q1 was right in line with our expectations overall, a very good result.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 32.8% compared with 31.8% for the same period last year, a 100-basis-point increase. This result reflected improved contract profitability, primarily in outsourcing, and net lower noncontract costs.","Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $868 million or 12% of net revenues compared with $837 million or 11.8% of net revenues for the first quarter last year. This quarter's results reflected higher business development costs to replenish our sales pipeline after our record Q4 bookings.","General and administrative expense was $449 million or 6.2% of net revenues compared with $433 million or 6.1% of net revenues for the first quarter last year, a 10-basis-point increase.","Operating income was $1.05 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 14.5% operating margin. This compares with $981 million or 13.9% operating margin in the first quarter last year, a year-over-year expansion of more than 60 basis points -- 66 basis points to be precise. This quarter, we were particularly pleased with our contract profitability, as I just mentioned, and also with our management of costs overall.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.8% compared with 28.3% for the first quarter last year as this year's Q1 rate included higher benefits related to final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities.","Net income was $766 million for the first quarter compared with $712 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 8%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.06 compared with $0.96 in the first quarter last year. The $0.10 increase is made up of a $0.07 increase from higher revenue and operating result, a $0.02 increase from a lower effective tax rate and a $0.02 increase from a lower share count, partially offset by a $0.01 decrease from lower nonoperating income.","Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 32 days, up from the low of 27 days last quarter and consistent with Q1 last fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $195 million rounded, resulting from cash used by operating activities of $109 million, plus property and equipment additions of $87 million. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow this quarter included the expected discretionary cash contribution of $500 million made to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which had a net impact on free cash flow in the quarter of $350 million after tax.","Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at November 30 was $5.7 billion. It compares with $6.6 billion at August 31 last year. We funded the pension payment as mentioned and the semiannual dividend, as well as some acquisitions in the quarter.","Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 259,000 people, and we now have approximately 167,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In Q1, our utilization was 88%, up from 87% in Q4. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 11% compared with 12% both in Q4 and in Q1 last fiscal year. Lastly, we expect that at least 50,000 people will join our company in fiscal '13. Attrition is down at this point, and overall hiring reflects the continued balancing of supply and demand as our business builds.","Before I turn things back to Pierre, I'll comment on our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 3 million shares for $221 million at an average price of $66.74 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $0.81 per share for a total of $560 million. This represented a $0.135 or a 20% increase over the dividend we paid in May.","With Q1 behind us, we've entered Q2 with solid results and strong profitability. We are pleased with our ability to deliver consistent results in what continues to be a challenging economic environment for our clients around the world.","Now let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you an update on some exciting things going on in our business, and then I'll finish up with our business outlook.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Pam. Our Q1 results reflect the continued focused execution of our world strategy, which as we shared with you at our Investor & Analyst Conference in October, is all about differentiation and competitiveness. And at a time where the macroeconomic environment is still quite volatile, we are particularly pleased with our continued ability to drive profitable growth. Our focus on operating margin expansion reflects our commitment to running the business with discipline to enhance our competitiveness. And over the years, we have developed and nurtured this mindset across the company.","At the same time, we remain focused on generating growth, winning the right business for Accenture and leveraging the latest industry and technology trends to provide differentiated services that create tangible business outcomes for clients. In particular, we continue to make excellent progress with our strategic initiatives in fast-growing areas such as Analytics, Mobility and Digital Marketing. Increasingly, chief marketing officers are becoming key buyers of our services, and we are making strategic investments in Digital Marketing to enhance Accenture Interactive to better serve them. In Q1, we expanded our Digital Marketing capabilities with the acquisition of avVenta Worldwide, a provider of digital production services.","Accenture Interactive now includes an end-to-end solution that enables CMOs to manage content from its initial creation all the way through to distribution. Accenture Interactive was key to a recent win at a leading consumer goods client where we're helping transform the shopping experience for customers with a new e-commerce platform that will integrate online and offline channels across 41 countries. And we are combining our capabilities in Digital, Analytics and Mobility to help Verizon Wireless launch a new strategic initiative called Precision Market Insights, which is designed to deliver targeted business intelligence to retailers and other enterprises that want to expand the reach and precision of their marketing efforts.","Our clients continue to turn to Accenture for our technology expertise, including the capabilities we have built on the Microsoft platform. We are helping a global financial institution migrate more than 300,000 Microsoft desktops, modernizing its IT infrastructure and reducing its application portfolio to increase efficiency. We will deliver this project with Avanade, our majority-owned joint venture with Microsoft, using proprietary assets to reduce migration time and costs.","Avanade is important to our strategy of playing a leading role in the technology ecosystem, and we continue to invest in the company. The recently announced acquisition of Azaleos Corporation will enhance Avanade's capability to provide remotely managed services for Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint and Lync.","Our clients continue to invest to transform their businesses, and we are bringing together the best of Accenture for them, combining our industry expertise with our management consulting, technology and business process outsourcing capabilities. We are working with a leading European telecommunications client on one of the world's largest ERP implementations, creating a global shared services organization to standardize business processes with the goal of eventually delivering 80% of transactions through mobile devices.","We are helping global Spanish bank BBVA with a landmark technology system upgrade in the U.S. Combining our core banking services with our Alnova software, we are helping implement a new system across more than 700 branches in 7 states. And just this morning, we announced that we have expanded our BPO agreement with Unilever to provide HR services for more than 130,000 employees across 100 countries.","Geographic expansion remains a key focus for us, and we continue to invest in priority emerging markets, as well as mature underpenetrated markets. In our priority emerging markets, revenues in Q1 continued to grow at a faster rate than Accenture overall. Our business in China, one of our key priority emerging markets, is performing very well. And we're off to a good start with double-digit growth in Q1.","I was in China 3 weeks ago where I had the opportunity to open the new Accenture Innovation Center for Financial Services in Beijing. This center, combined with our new technology lab, which is also in Beijing, give us a great environment to engage with clients, to explore industry and technology innovation. And our business in the Americas is also off to a good start with 10% revenue growth in Q1 led by the United States and Brazil.","In summary, I remain confident that in this fast-changing environment, we are executing the right strategy, a strategy that is clearly aligned with the transformation needs of our clients. We continue to see strong demand for our services, and our highly diverse portfolio of business, combined with our industry expertise and broad technology capabilities, positions us very well to seize the opportunities we see in the marketplace.","With that, I will turn it back to Pam, who will provide our business outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year.","Pamela J. Craig","Thank you, Pierre. Now let me give you our update on how our fiscal year '13 is shaping up. We continue to expect the growth rate in outsourcing to be higher than in consulting this year with consulting ramping up in the second half. As you and we expect of us, we remain focused and disciplined about driving our business for profitable growth.","So let's start with our outlook for the next quarter's revenue and then go through the elements of our annual outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal '13, we expect revenues to be in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.15 billion. This assumes a foreign exchange impact of negative 1% compared to the second quarter in fiscal '12.","Turning to the full fiscal year. Our assumption for foreign exchange is unchanged. Based upon how the rates have been trending over the last couple of weeks, we assume the impact of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to continue to be negative 1% for fiscal '13 compared to fiscal '12. We will update you on our assumption for the full year foreign exchange impact each quarter.","First, revenue. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect Accenture's net revenue to grow in the range of 5% to 8% in local currency over fiscal '12. Although we expect to be close to the bottom of the range for the first half of the fiscal year, we also expect that year-over-year growth will pick up in the second half based on the revenue we have contracted and the strength of our opportunity pipeline.","New bookings, we continue to target to be in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion for the full year fiscal '13. As you know, our bookings can be lumpy from quarter to quarter, and we do expect our bookings in Q2 to be higher than they were in Q1.","We now expect operating margin to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.2% for fiscal '13. This is a 10-basis-point increase from our outlook of last quarter and a 20 to 30-basis-point expansion over fiscal '12. We are proactively balancing profitability with making necessary investments to position our business for the future. You should expect some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, as we've seen in the past.","We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. As I mentioned in Q4, this tax rate range reflects some final determinations, and there may be more that will materialize during the year.","For earnings per share, we are raising our outlook and now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '13 to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.32 or 10% to 12-plus percent growth. The change primarily reflects our expected additional operating margin expansion.","Now let's turn to cash flow. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion, property and equipment additions to be $420 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion.","We remain committed to return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders. In fiscal '13, we continue to target a return of at least $3.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases.","I continue to be very proud of our Accenture leaders and all of our people around the globe as they're working very hard to conduct and drive our business in a way that delivers value to our clients, to our company and to our shareholders.","With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, Pam. [Operator Instructions] Tom, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois representing Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just a couple of questions on the revenue growth front. Is there a common theme on what's causing the added demand weakness on small and medium-sized consulting deals? And are you seeing any signs that those trends might change when calendar '13 budgets are finalized, either change for the better or even maybe on the risk side, they can change for the worse? I mean, I'm just wondering what you're reading in the budget finalization process and how you're incorporating that into your guidance given that it seems the challenge has been on the small consulting deals that sometimes, I think, are more difficult to predict.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, Rod, I mean, I think first of all, it is more in EMEA that we see it and not in all patches. And you're right, it is the harder stuff to predict in a way because it comes in and typically converts to revenue during the quarter or fairly quickly. So we don't see it getting worse. We do see this trending up through the year, and we do see a good pipeline for small and medium-sized consulting projects, as well as the larger, longer, more transformational ones.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And so it sounds like you have some confidence based on what you're seeing in the pipeline, and in the revenues, you already have under contract, that you have some confidence that your constant currency year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of the year. Can you just comment on what some of the main underlying factors are that give you that confidence? I mean, which areas of the business are going to drive the reacceleration? That would be helpful if you can give some more specifics on that.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, Rod, this is Pierre here. And indeed, we are confident that in the other part of the year, our revenue will ramp up. And what's making us confident, a couple of things. I mean, first, we're building the pipeline. We continue to build the pipeline, both in consulting and outsourcing. And second, we have the contracted revenue creating the visibility for us and making us confident that in the second part of the year, we will have the expected growth as we are confirming here. Some of the highlight, if you will, we continue to see strong demand in old and new technologies. And I mentioned Digital Marketing, Cloud, Software-as-a-Service, also old Mobility. All those new technologies continue to drive strong demand. Of course, we continue to see very healthy demand in all those related to outsourcing and BPO. And as well from an industry standpoint, we had a pretty good news in Q1 regarding our HPS and Financial Services verticals. So we have facts making us confident that indeed we should deliver against what we've planned.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then just one final clarification there. I mean, the revenue growth in constant currency being at 5%, I mean, I think that's a little bit disappointing on The Street. People were expecting that you'd be more in the middle of that range in the first half of the year. Is the softness in revenue growth in the first half more a function of your large deals ramping slower than you might have expected? Or is it more a function of small consulting deals just not coming in at a fast enough clip to allow you to be higher in that revenue growth guidance range?","Pamela J. Craig","Rod, it's primarily the former, but there is some impact of the latter, too, as I mentioned in my comments. And just by the way, when we put together our plan last summer, this is exactly what we expected in terms of the first half, is that it would be lower in the -- lower growth in the second half.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of the Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to ask first about Asia. It looks like it slowed a little bit relative to the other regions. Anything unusual there to call out? Did it perform versus plan, specifically in Asia?","Pierre Nanterme","No. Again, I mean, we're pleased with where we are in Asia with our growth of 8%. If you look at where we are, we have some good result in some very important countries for us. I'm thinking about China. I'm thinking about South Africa. I'm thinking about India as well. So we continue to make some good steps in Asia, and again, we are where we want to be.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes. I mean, Asia's now -- Asia Pac is now 15% of our business, and as you know, we've had very strong growth over the last couple of years. Frankly, and looking at this, we still had good high single-digit growth in the kind of the anchor markets: Japan, Australia, Singapore. And as Pierre just mentioned, very strong growth in China and India. So overall, we are pleased with these results even though this growth has moderated from the very high levels over the last couple of years.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, it was good growth. I was just surprised to see it coming a little below the Americas. That's all. That's helpful to hear. Just as my follow-up, just, Pam, on the buybacks, I guess that's also running a little bit below trend. Anything to read into on the buybacks? Or was that just a function of timing with the pension contribution?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I mean, it's early in the year. And 3 months ago, we did see more uncertainty in the broader market. And as we sit here today, we're committed to return the $3.3 billion and to ramp up the repurchases in the latter part of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the consulting business. You talked about weakness in Europe. Did you see weakness in the U.S. around the fiscal cliff uncertainty that would maybe start to get pushed through assuming we get a resolution here in the near future?","Pierre Nanterme","I will leave that to Pam, especially the U.S.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, we'll let you do France, Pierre. So in the U.S., we haven't seen a lot of impact from the fiscal cliff. I mean, we've assumed, Katy, that the executive and legislative branches of our government will reach an agreement, and our guidance was based on the fact that positive growth will continue in the United States.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, Pam, I think you've talked about in recent quarters sole-sourced win rate in the 60% range, which is above the historical average, clearly a sign that you can continue to take share. But when you compare your guidance of 5% to 8% growth, it's only slightly ahead of the 5% growth rate for the market. Is that just conservatism? Or do you have less confidence in the market growth or your ability to take share this fiscal year?","Pamela J. Craig","Well sometimes, it's just sort of how the timing works. And I think that this pattern in consulting that we've seen of these bigger, longer deals that are converting to revenues slower, that, that timing is impacting our growth rate, particularly in the first half of this fiscal year.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And the sole-sourced win rate is still up in the 60% range?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, yes, it is.","Pierre Nanterme","And we believe that with 5% to 8%, we will indeed gain market share.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess my first question is on the pipeline. You talked about replenishing the pipeline. Can you comment on how that effort is progressing and the types of contracts that you're seeing in the pipeline nowadays? Is it -- and how different is it relative to, say, 12 months ago?","Pamela J. Craig","Ashwin, I mean, one of the things we're very focused on was rebuilding the pipeline for the largest deals that we do. We call them megas and indeed, that part of our pipeline was up significantly in Q1 because we had a very large bookings quarter in Q4. So that's one bit of color I can give you. And otherwise, our pipeline is up because we did indeed put focus on that in the first quarter to get us well positioned for the rest of the year.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And with regards to revenues, you guys did say in the past, obviously, that 1Q and 2Q would be weaker with the second half pickup. So that's kind of expected as before. But relative to 2Q, is there anything different that you're looking at now given all the uncertainty sort of -- I would call it incremental uncertainty in Europe, as well as fiscal cliff-related uncertainty here. Are you kind of sort of -- should we sort of be writing off December and January and it's sort of a 1-month quarter, that kind of weakness?","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, to comment on this, I mean, clearly, we've not seen any change in the marketplace relative to the element you're mentioning. As you would imagine, we're watching carefully what's happening. But we've not seen in December any change in pattern regarding our clients. And as we said, we are particularly pleased with our performance in Americas, including the performance in the U.S. for Q1. Regarding Q2, we are providing our direction, and we have no reason to change our view on Q2 at this stage.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about EMEA. It was up 10% constant currency in 1Q '12 and 2Q '12. Then it dropped to 4% in 3Q, and then it backed up to 8% in 4Q. So I thought we were kind of out of the woods, but now we're now flat in the first quarter '13. So is that just the volatility in the market? Is that all consulting? Just looking to make sure I understand what exactly is happening in that region.","Pierre Nanterme","I will start with EMEA because I'm a native there. So indeed, we are flat. But as always, as you know, it's covering multiple countries. I mean, first, we're overall pleased with part of the performance. And outsourcing continues to do very well in that part of the world. And if you look from a country standpoint, we're doing very well in countries such as Germany, for instance. And we are flat to positive in many important countries for us such as the U.K., such as Italy, such as Spain. So again, you need to look at these from a portfolio management standpoint. We are where we expected to be, and I think we've always been very clear in the prior quarters about the direction and how the Q1 would shape in EMEA. But we continue to see some positive trends there and opportunities.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a couple of quick ones. On consulting, obviously, it was flat in constant currency. Should we expect it to be around flat again? Or could that turn negative this quarter?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I believe, Bryan, it will be flattish again, little up, little down. But I mean, I think it will be a similar pattern to the first quarter and the second and then pick up into positive digits in the second half.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, last quick one. Headcount growth, I think, you said would be around or over 50,000. That's a little bit below, I think, the 60,000 that you mentioned last quarter. I just wanted to see if that's correct. And then secondly, contracted revenue for the next 4 quarters was 9% last quarter. Just looking for an update.","Pamela J. Craig","Okay. First of all, you're right. We said we -- we'd say now we're going to hire at least 50,000 people, and I think that reflects a few things. One is that attrition is down. And second, you'll see that we do -- we have had a nice increase in the Global Delivery Network, and we're carefully, as I think you'd expect of us, managing supply and demand around the world and getting positioned for the business building in the latter part of the year. We hired a number of people -- a lot of people in Q4, and so it was down a little bit in this quarter. Regarding your second question, we're up -- we have about 8% more under contract over the remainder of the year versus this time last year. Pretty close in both consulting and outsourcing.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just thinking about the bottom-up build of the model a little bit, as I think we always do. I'm still -- still heavy appetite here for some numbers. On the utilization front and thinking about pricing and really the levers, right, so of course, you guys have already sort of communicated and conveyed through the confidence that you guys have in getting to the numbers and the targets. But sort of thinking through in some of the -- maybe more of the mechanics of the model, if headcount has already been reduced a little bit in terms of the gross head planned for you guys, obviously, attrition is helping some there, but if pricing doesn't come through or if utilization is already running kind of high, what will drive that acceleration into the back half of the year? And some of it, I guess, could be some of the acquisition benefits. Some of it could be the kind of more nonlinear components. I'm just trying to get my arms around how best to think about the drivers that could help in the back half of the year.","Pamela J. Craig","Well, I think utilization is up a little bit, and that reflects some -- the Global Delivery Network, a slightly larger proportion. I think on the people side, I mean, we're getting the people where we need them, and that part is what we need to do. So I'm confident that we're going to do that. And it's really just to match that up with the consulting growth as it materializes. So I think the main levers we have, and we had some really good progress on this, this quarter, where we are, I think, doing better than ever in terms of cost management and that kind of rigor and discipline about making sure we have that everywhere on contracts, in noncontracts and then pushing for pricing where we can. And where the business cases are best, we can. So we will never give up on that, and that's always a part of what we do. Prices overall were relatively stable this quarter.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just on the nonlinear idea or some way to think about software or platform-based businesses as a percentage of your revenues, is there any color that you guys can share in terms of how big that could be at this point as a percentage of revenue?","Pierre Nanterme","I would characterize it as being probably stable. We continue to make investments in solutions and software on a very targeted and specific basis. I mean, recall the 2 recent acquisitions we made, one in the technology -- Microsoft technology and the other one around the Digital Marketing. And again, it's the same spirit so far, it's to invest in very niche and specific software to provide differentiated solutions. That's what we do, and that's what we'll continue to do. Of course, through our BPO and some of those activities, there is a less linear correlation between the people and the business. But overall, there is no change with our current strategy.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a follow-up question on consulting. I think you guys were pretty clear that the first half will be flat in terms of revenue growth and then move into positive territory in the second half. But just to probe that a little bit further, I think last quarter, you had said for full year fiscal '13, low to mid-single digits is the constant currency range you were expecting. Sounds like that's still doable, but I just wanted to test that a little bit. Is the lower end more likely just where it looks like you'll be through the first half of the year? I know you're going to have some easier comparisons certainly helping later on in the year. But I just wanted to make sure we have our expectations calibrated properly if, in fact, the lower end now looks more likely.","Pamela J. Craig","Well, I mean, I certainly agree with part of what you said, Jason, which is that for the first half, flattish, and for the full year, low to mid-single digits. And so that means that we're going to come up into the mid-single digits positive, maybe a little higher in the second half of the year in consulting.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. I mean, I guess what I'm just getting at is, is the higher end of the range still realistic when you think about the low to mid-single digits for the full year?","Pamela J. Craig","This is for consulting or the 5% to 8% overall?","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, consulting only.","Pamela J. Craig","Yes. I mean, based on our pipeline, I mean, we -- I mean, in consulting, we have stuff to convert, right, so this execution is up to us. Yes, we see that.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, understood. And just to switch gears a little bit, we've been hearing and reading a bit more about some of the big 4 accounting firms substantially increasing their nonaudit businesses in areas like consulting. I know that's been going on in the past few years, and they're probably going to be encountering some conflict of interest questions around that. But are you seeing or experiencing any more competition from those types of firms out in the marketplace? I mean, clearly, you guys are gaining share overall on a global basis across the competitive landscape. But any uptick in competitiveness from this group in particular?","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, that's clearly part of, I mean, our competitors. As you know, we're competing against everybody in all the different segments of our business from management consulting to technology to AO. That's the nature of our business. And I mean, believe me, when we have more competition, it's just pushing us to do better. So we love that. We'll just try to continue raising our game, to compete, to win and to gain market share.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Price representing BB&T Capital Markets.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just I kind of wanted to just follow up on a couple of the questions that have been asked regarding consulting growth and kind of how that's going to trend. I know you just addressed it with Bryan and then with Jason. But I guess is the expectation -- is the expectation based on consulting work that's kind of contracted? Or is that mainly pipeline? You alluded to pipeline, but I guess I wanted to make sure that, that was more of the case.","Pamela J. Craig","It's both. It's what's contracted, as well as pipeline. And remember, we have that effect of the longer -- larger, longer consulting deals that are bleeding in at a slower pace, right, so that's going to start to really take in the second part of the year.","Pierre Nanterme","And again, I mean, keep in mind that if you're looking at the last quarters, our consulting bookings remain very strong, including in Q1 above the $4 billion mark. So the point is exactly as Pam mentioned, is the nature of the consulting demand, which has changed from longer term -- more longer term and less shorter term. So there is a kind of conversion rate from booking to revenues, which is different. But this is our expectation that indeed, those very strong bookings we had in these last quarters will convert in revenues -- second part of the year.","Pamela J. Craig","And I'm just going to add that the book-to-bill for consulting, which I'm sure you've already calculated, is 1.1 in the first quarter.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Right, right, okay. Has consulting growth bottomed in Europe, do you think?","Pamela J. Craig","I think we're turning the corner there overall. And of course, it's a little bit -- not every operating group or every industry or every country is alike. There's some variability, for sure. But we are really starting to turn the corner in my view. And of course, we look at sequential and how that's doing, and we see that happening overall, obviously, in order to predict the growth rates in the second half of the year.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So with that, I guess you'd -- it kind of sounds like second quarter is going to be the bottom overall, and that's consistent, you think, with Europe. Is that fair?","Pamela J. Craig","I do. We do see EMEA picking up in the latter part of the year in consulting.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And last question, you talked about SI bookings last quarter were obviously a record. And this quarter, I think you mentioned that they were holding their own. Were they -- just a little bit of, I don't know, maybe a little subtle change there in tone. Were they up actually year-over-year? And could you maybe talk a little bit more about what you observed in terms of changes in bookings for SI?","Pamela J. Craig","Yes, I actually meant to communicate that as a positive in terms of SI bookings because despite -- we continue to have some shift to the Global Delivery Network and despite a few of these other patterns in terms of the shorter-term stuff, that actually the book-to-bill in system integration was very good. It was in management consulting where it was off a little.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. But SI was up?","Pamela J. Craig","What's up?","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Up year-over-year, I'm sorry.","Pamela J. Craig","Let me -- we'll check that. I just want to make sure I'm accurate before I answer.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Darrin Peller representing Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just to follow up, I mean, you mentioned strength in some of the larger albeit slower consulting projects but some weaker trends in smaller-sized deals, I think, in terms of the consulting side. In other words, your 2013 growth doesn't have as much benefit from these smaller, more nimble deals. How big of a contributor would that normally be for you in terms of growth contribution? In other words, how much are we missing from the smaller-sized deals?","Pamela J. Craig","I actually don't have that to provide to you exactly, but we do see -- I mean, I personally think the fact that we have a greater proportion of these longer, larger, in my view, stickier consulting work, that, that's ultimately better for our business. And so again, this trend, the way it bleeds through is important. It does impact the growth rate in a different quarter, and certainly this quarter and next, we see that. Nonetheless, I think in general, it's a positive trend. And just back to the other question, system integration bookings were up 3% in local currency.","Pierre Nanterme","[indiscernible] on this, and it's a very positive trend. Again, I mean, if you look at the consulting bookings, just to confirm, I mean, $4.2 billion and a book-to-bill which is over 1, so we build -- we are building -- I know backlog is not the right terminology, but I'm an old-fashioned guy. So we're building contracted revenues moving forward. And indeed, the fact that we are contracting on longer-term consulting will make over time our business more resilient with more visibility over time. Now it's happening that for a typical quarter, it's creating the effect you see. But it's making us confident that over time and at the second part of the year, those contracting revenues will generate consulting growth.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. I mean, I think that's fair. It's definitely a good trend. I think we're just trying to understand how much of a call option there is to the upside when this kind of business does return to more nimble, probably cyclical projects, come back with a little more strength. But I hear you. I mean, a long-term business, obviously, is beneficial. Just a quick follow-up, if you don't mind, on the pricing side. We've heard from some of the larger Indian-based outsourcing firms that pricing's come down a bit, and a bit for them at [indiscernible] some of them to gain back some of the market share. Are you seeing that anywhere?","Pierre Nanterme","From a pricing standpoint, I think we will call the pricing stable with, as always, some pocket of improvement. But let's say stable overall.","Pamela J. Craig","Right.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","My first question was just you talked about going forward that the bookings were going to pick up next quarter. How should we think about that in relation to the current decision-making and business trends? Is that an indication that, that's continuing and the momentum's actually picking up heading into the year?","Pamela J. Craig","I think it's a little bit more about us going from the high bookings in Q4 to this quarter and just how we've been building our pipeline and how we see the stuff converting over the course of this quarter, and we're actually already off to a decent start. So I think a lot of it is, or at least a portion of it is, related to us. And then in terms of the environment, we commented we did not see really anything specific that's leading us to think that there's any kind of pause going on right now in terms of the kind of work that we're signing up.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. My second and last question, just you talked about consulting projects and more large deals coming in and less small deals. So I guess there's probably 2 parts to this question. First, why would people be more willing to commit to the large deals than the small deals? And is that based on geography? And also, based on the fact that this is going to be back end loaded this year, I'm wondering, what would potentially derail that? Would that take a shift in the macro for that to change at all?","Pamela J. Craig","I think the reason that the complexion of the projects are different is because these longer, larger ones are more critical. And perhaps these other things are things that not just aren't as critical, some of the smaller stuff. If you look at what's happening with the big banks, for example. And certainly geographically, that's the case. The kinds of things they need to do are different than they were in the past based on the transformation that's going on in the industry. And that's true with the big telecom companies as well. So I think a lot of it is that.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I think that's exactly right. What we see, and this is what's making us confident despite all the volatile and uncertain environment we see, is the transformational business is still there because all the giants or big companies and global leaders we're serving, they need to comply with new regulation, they need to be more global, they need to rationalize, and they need to do all of these at scale. And this is what, I think, was reflected in a couple of illustrations I made earlier. I mean, look at what we just contracted today -- we announced today, not contracted, with Unilever. It's such a good illustration of what's happening. So our positioning on the transformational business, high-end, large-scale program is resonating with our clients and aligned with their needs. And we continue to see that type of demand in the marketplace. That's why we are remaining confident.","Okay. So thanks again, everybody, for joining us on today's call. With the first quarter behind us, again, we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive profitable growth with a sharp focus on providing highly differentiated services to our clients and improving our competitiveness in the marketplace. As I travel around the world, I can see the opportunities in front of us, and I can tell you that the men and women of Accenture are fully mobilized and focused on delivering value for our clients and for Accenture every day. I want to take this opportunity to wish all of you, our investors and analysts, as well as our Accenture people who are listening to the call, a very happy holiday season and all the best for the New Year.

Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2016 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I\u2019m KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.","On today\u2019s call, you will hear from Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.","Let me quickly outline the agenda for today\u2019s call.

Given some travel limitations, I\u2019m not able to be with you in Boston this week. So David and I decided to pre-record our remarks and then he will be available to take your questions at the end of the call.","Let me start by saying how very pleased I am with our excellent financial results for both the quarter and the year. I\u2019m particularly pleased with our durable and balanced performance. We have now delivered double-digit revenue growth for two years in a row, and we have gained significant market share.","Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $35.4 billion. We generated record revenues of $32.9 billion with 10.5% growth in local currency. We delivered earnings per share of $5.34 on an adjusted basis [an 11%] increase.","Operating margin was 14.6% an expansion of 10 basis point on an adjusted basis. We generated very strong free cash flow of $4.1 billion. We returned $4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share, a 10% increase over our prior dividend.","So we delivered an excellent fiscal year. I feel very good about our performance and the momentum we have in our business, which clearly reflect the value of the services we provide to our clients each and every day.","Now, let me hand over to David.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call. We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforce our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it relates to being a leader in partnering with our clients to rotate their business to The New, including digital, cloud and security.","By any measure, our fourth quarter capped off what has been another truly outstanding year for Accenture, which is even more impressive when you consider that our fiscal 2016 results followed an equally strong year in fiscal 2015.","At a high level, our quarter four results continued to reflect strong performance across all three of our financial imperatives, durable revenue growth faster than the market, sustainable margin expansion while investing it scale in our business and our people, and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation.","To be more specific, quarter four represented our 10th consecutive quarter of strong growth, with continued significant gains in market share. Our net revenue growth of just over 9% local currency was broad-based and balanced across most dimensions of our business.","Our operating margin of 14.1% came in as expected and up 20 basis points from quarter four of last year. We were especially pleased with the underlying drivers of profitability, which enabled us to invest significantly in our business and our people during the quarter. And we delivered strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.9 billion, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business, while returning significant cash to our shareholders.","So we finished the year in a manner which was very consistent with the previous three quarters, with strong broad-based growth underpinned by very good profitability and cash flows.","With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.8 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0. And outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with our new bookings in the quarter, which came in as we expected and reflected continued strong demand for digital related services. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $35.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 7% growth in local currency.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1.5%. Revenues were approximately $40 million above the upper end of our previously guided range when adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact.","Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 11% in USD and 13% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. The trends in revenue growth across our five businesses were very similar to last quarter.","Strategy and consulting services combined, as well as operations, posted another quarter of double-digit growth, while application services delivered very solid growth in the mid-single-digit range and across those four businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in The New led by digital related services.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 18% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in products reflects the rapid adoption of The New across all of the industries within products. And our investments over the past few years are serving us very well in meeting the new demands of our clients.","H&PS posted another strong quarter with 11% growth, driven by a continued double-digit growth in health, and overall in North America and the growth markets. Financial Services grew 9% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets, as well as positive growth across all three geographies, led by a double-digit growth in Europe.","Communications, Media & Technology growth landed consistent with our expectations at 5% and reflected continued strong overall growth in North America and the growth markets. In Europe, we did see contraction driven primarily by communications. Finally, resources growth was flat in the quarter, as we continued to navigate cyclical headwinds in both energy and chemicals and natural resources. We continued to be very pleased with double-digit growth in utilities, which is benefiting from clients investments to digitize their businesses.","Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared to 31.7% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.7% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.1% compared to 6.2% for the same quarter last year.","Operating income was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.1% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter four last year. In the fourth quarter, as part of launching a joint venture with Apax Partners, we closed our Duck Creek transaction.","This transaction, along with an immaterial adjustment to finalize our gain on the divestiture of Navitaire lowered our quarter four tax rate by 1.8% and increased net income by $249 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.37. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the fourth quarter last year. Net income on an adjusted basis was $881 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $788 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.31 compared with EPS of $1.15 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 14% year-over-year increase.","Day services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 37 days in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $160 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.9 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31 last year.","Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the year with a global headcount of about 384,000 people. Utilization was 92% compared to 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 16%, up 1% from quarter three and up 2% from the same period last year.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5.6 million shares for $640 million at an average price of $114.52 per share. At August 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","As Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the previous semi-annual dividend we declared in March.","So before I turn it back over to Pierre, I want to reflect on where we landed for the full-year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. I am extremely pleased that we continued our track record of successfully executing our strategy and managing our business to deliver on the business outlook we provided at the beginning of our fiscal year.","Net revenues grew approximately 10.5% local currency for the full-year, well above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. Growth was strong and balanced across our operating groups, geographies and businesses. We are very pleased with double-digit growth in products, H&PS and financial services, as well as, overall in both North America and Europe.","From a business perspective, we posted double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined, as well as operations, with very good mid single-digit growth in application services. And of course, across the Board, we saw a double-digit growth in The New, estimated to represent approximately 40% of our revenues for the year, led by digital-related services with estimated growth of approximately 30%.","Operating margin was 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin and within the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Importantly, we were very pleased with the scale of our investments on our business and our people as we created additional investment capacity, resulting from improvements in our underlying profitability.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.34, reflecting 11% growth over adjusted FY 2015 and was above the upper end of our original guided range, primarily driven by our strong topline growth. Free cash flow was $4.1 billion, above our original guided range and reflecting a free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.1.","And finally, we delivered on all of our capital allocation objectives by investing over $930 million, primarily attributed to 15 acquisitions and returning $4 billion of cash to shareholders.","So again, following a very strong year in fiscal 2015, our leadership team and employees around the world have done it again with another truly outstanding year. These results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows, and our ability to manage our business to deliver value to all of our shareholders.","Now let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. Our outstanding performance in fiscal 2016, demonstrate that our growth strategy continues to resonate with our clients, and that we are clearly executing very well. We are benefiting from the actions we have taken over the last few years to align Accenture along five distinct businesses, to transform the services we offer and to increase our investments in new and high-growth areas.","This is all that\u2019s driving differentiation for Accenture and making us the most relevant professional services company to lead in The New digital world. Our five businesses: Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations are each highly competitive in their own right, as well as synergistic in delivering value for our clients.","Today, the breadth of capabilities we provide end-to-end is truly unique in the marketplace. From being relevant in the boardroom to delivering cutting-edge technologies, digital solutions and innovative platforms, to operating services on behalf of clients, to drive tangible outcomes.","At the same time, we have transformed the services we offer, rotating our business rapidly to what we call The New, digital, cloud and security-related services, which, together, accounted for about $13.5 billion or 40% of total revenues in fiscal 2016. That is a substantial increase from approximately 30% of revenues just a year ago.","Let me show a few examples of how we are helping clients on with The New. In digital, we are working with many hotels, the European hospitality company to implement a digital transformation strategy to increase sales across all channels through data driven customer segmentation. In just one-year, direct sales were up of 27% and more than one million people have joined Meli\u00e1\u2019s Rewards program.","In cloud, we are helping Rio Tinto, a global mining company, transition its enterprise systems to the public cloud, including the world\u2019s largest SAP production system migration to Microsoft Azure, delivering increased agility with an as-a-Service model.","And in security, our cyber experts are working with large U.S. based utility to define, develop and run a next-generation security operations center. We are developing a comprehensive strategy to assess risk, managed identity and enable alerts for cyber threats in real-time. We continue to make significant investments across our business, particularly in acquisitions.","In fiscal 2016, we invented more than $930 million of capital in acquisitions and that is on top of about $800 million last year. And when we look at these last two years, I\u2019m delighted that about 70% of our investments in acquisitions have been in The New. In the fourth quarter alone, we announced five acquisitions in The New, including three digital services companies: MOBGEN in the Netherlands, Tecnil\u00f3gica in Spain and dgroup in Germany. And two security companies: Maglan in Israel and Redcore in Australia.","We continued to see strong demand from our clients for large scale mission-critical transformation programs. The broad range of services we provide across our five businesses, together with our deep industry expertise, continues to differentiate Accenture and we remain the partner of choice for the world\u2019s leading companies.","For Stryker, the medical technology company, we are helping transform its business operations to enable more growth and agility. We are leveraging the Accenture SAP Business Solutions Group to build a solution on S\/4 HANA, spanning finance, sales logistics, supply chain and procurements.","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I am delighted as we delivered another year of both strong and balanced growth around the world, with double-digit revenue growth in local currency for the second year in a row in both North America and Europe, as well as in many other largest countries.","In North America, we delivered 11% growth in local currency, driven by the United States where we have now delivered double-digit growth of five of the last six years. In Europe, we grew even 11% in local currency, with double-digit growth in the UK, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and Germany, as well as high single-digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we grew revenue 8% in local currency, driven primarily by double-digit growth in Japan, as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India, South Africa and Mexico.","Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our ongoing imperative to drive innovation across our business and to create cutting-edge solutions for clients. In today\u2019s fast changing environment where companies need to continually reinvent themselves, we are increasingly taking innovation-led approach to drive more value for our clients and help them invent the future.","Our approach to innovation spans everything we do, from Accenture Research where we identify market and technology trends, to Accenture Ventures, where we invest in growth-stage companies; to the Accenture Labs, where we incubate and prototype new concepts through applied R&D, to Accenture Studios, where we build innovative solutions for clients with speed and agility.","Our unique approach with the Accenture innovation architecture enables us to combine our capabilities across the company to invent, develop and deliver disruptive innovations for clients and to serve them faster. So as we enter fiscal year 2017, we have momentum in our business. And you can count on us to continue to invest and build our capabilities for the future in order to deliver strong, durable and profitable growth.","With that, I will turn the call over to David, who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2017, and then take your questions. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thanks, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.65 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year 2017, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal 2016.","For the full fiscal 2017, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal 2016. For operating margin, we expect fiscal year 2017 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal 2016 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%.","This range includes an estimated benefit of less than 2% from our early adoption of a new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. For earnings per share, we expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.98 or 8% to 12% growth over adjusted fiscal 2016 results.","Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal 2017, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion.","We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income. We expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks, David. As Pierre mentioned, David will be taking your questions. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those in the call, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Please go ahead.","Keith Bachman","Hi.","David Rowland","Hi, good morning, Keith.","Keith Bachman","Good morning, sir. Thank you very much. Very strong results indeed, particularly in the climate that we\u2019re in. The operating margin performance for the quarter, or for the year, is what I wanted to ask about. For FY2016, you guided to 10 to 30 basis points. You came in at the lower end of the range. What were the circumstances you think that contributed to that? And as you look to the guide, which is similar of 10 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion, what are the forces that you think would cause some influence in that income? Are you thinking more about the low end of the range again? And just any color on that. Thanks very much.","David Rowland","Great. Thank you for the question. As you\u2019ve heard Pierre and me say several times over the last really couple of years, we are at a period that really calls for us making a significant level of investments in our business to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and also position ourselves for long-term market leadership beyond just the year that we\u2019re in.","And when you look at the 10 to 30 basis point range, that\u2019s a range that we feel very comfortable that we can deliver within. And I would say that the swing factor generally, and it was the case this year, was the extent to which we invested in the business. And as you know, just doing the simple math, the difference in 10 basis points is about $35 million.","Keith Bachman","Okay.","David Rowland","And so when you look at this year, we were very pleased with the overall level of investments that we made in the business and it was that marginally higher level of investments that we made. To be clear, our investments were significantly higher, I\u2019m talking about on the margin, even a little higher than the otherwise would have been which resulted in 10 basis points versus 20 basis points.","So it\u2019s simply a reflection of the fact that we are managing a large investment pool in the business and on the margin, an additional $35 million one way or the other is the difference between, let\u2019s say, being at the low end or the upper end, but we are quite pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion. We created significantly more expansion in our underlying profitability in order to fund really a material level of investments overall. So we are quite pleased with that dynamic in our results, if you will.","Keith Bachman","Okay, great. And then my follow-up, if I could, as it relates to that, perhaps I missed it, but I don\u2019t know if you said how much you\u2019re contemplating that M&A would contribute to this year\u2019s guidance?","David Rowland","Yes, good question. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve said it in the prepared remarks, but the answer is about 2%.","Keith Bachman","Okay. Many thanks. Best of luck.","David Rowland","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins","Thanks. Good morning.","David Rowland","Hi. Good morning, Sara.","Sara Gubins","So last year, you started out at 5% to 8% constant currency revenue growth, and ended up above 10%. As you look to FY2017, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what could drive your revenue trend to be at the lower end of the outlook, and perhaps what could drive it above? And if you could talk about your expectations for digital revenue growth in FY2017 in The New, that would be great. Thanks.","David Rowland","Great, thank you. So, let me just take a minute and just frame how we see the environment and then how that relates to our guidance. I think, first of all, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise to anyone on this call, in balance, we see the overall macro environment being more volatile, let\u2019s say, at this time than where it was a year-ago entering fiscal 2016. So we\u2019d see a higher level of volatility overall in the macro environment for the reasons that this group understands very well.","Having said that, in that context, our guidance assumes that the market growth, and when I reference market growth, I\u2019m talking about the basket of publicly traded companies. We expect for purposes of managing our business and the outlook that the market growth is going to be very similar in 2017 to what we saw in 2016. And in 2016, to be clear, we saw organic growth in the basket of publicly traded companies of about 2.5%.","Now just to pause on that point for a minute that means that in 2016, we had an extraordinary result of growing roughly three times the basket for the full fiscal year, which is really tremendous and a reflection of - the power of our strategy and our capabilities and the relevance of the work that we\u2019re doing with our clients. The overall basket, including the inorganic, grew at about 4.5%. So the market environment that we see is organic of 2.5 overall growth, let\u2019s say, a 4.5% in that range.","Now offsetting that so a higher risk profile in the macro - the market growth, as I called out is the fact that we\u2019re starting this year with a high level of confidence, we continued to see strong momentum in our business. And that\u2019s a reflection of the things that we have done very uniquely and positioning our business for the market of today and the market that we see in the future.","When you look at what we\u2019ve done organizing around five distinct businesses that can operate and do operate as leaders in their own right individually, but also can come together to do transformational work for our clients in a highly differentiated way. When you look at the extent we have invested in rotating our business to The New, meeting those new and emerging needs of our clients.","All of that grounded in our innovation and grounded in our significant industry differentiation through our operating groups and the skills we have there. All of that continues to come together in a powerful way, and we\u2019re very comfortable with the momentum that we have going into the year, all that translates in the 5% to 8% growth.","As always, the range represents what we think is the full range of possibilities, we always work hard everyday to be at the upper end of the range. Across the entire range, it would be higher than market growth than we would gain share. And if we were to land toward the upper end of the range, that would continue to be about double the rate of the market growth, of which would be quite a strong result. So hopefully, that gives you the context in terms of how we see the market and our guidance.","Sara Gubins","Great. And then within that digital and The New, how are you expecting those to grow, given difficult comparisons but strong momentum?","David Rowland","We\u2019d see both of those continuing to grow at strong double-digit growth. They will grow significantly higher than the average of Accenture overall. As we said last year, I believe, I think I said either on this call or at IA day is that, while we are very confident in our positioning in The New and the three components, from a planning standpoint or from a guidance standpoint, it\u2019s not prudent for us to assume that it\u2019s going to grow 30 plus percent again, one-month into the year.","So we have, let\u2019s say a more practical view, but yet still a view of strong double-digit growth at this point. And as the market opportunity - to the extent it becomes a higher level of growth similar to what we saw this year, then we\u2019ll ramp up our capability and meet that need just as we did in 2016.","Sara Gubins","Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Hi, good morning, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Good morning. Thanks David. Just a follow-up to Sara\u2019s question. I guess why might this year be different, in terms of what you might deliver, relative to your guidance? It sounds like a lot of confidence, as you said, macro is more volatile, but maybe the starting point is similar. Can you comment maybe on visibility, or anything that might differentiate this year versus last year, based on what you see?","David Rowland","Well, as we start the year, maybe \u2013 let me answer that through the lens of our five operating groups and that might be helpful in terms of what might be different. If you look at our five operating groups against the 5% to 8% range, at the top end of the spectrum, if you will, you have products, which is the operating group that is positioned for the strongest level of growth. And we think it\u2019s likely that products would deliver a level of growth that is above the range of 5% to 8% and really continue to lead the way for the growth in Accenture.","Now will it be as high as it was in 2016? I don\u2019t think anyone would expect us to assume a repeat of 18%, but yet it will continue to be very, very strong. On the other end of the spectrum, we have resources. And resources is really doing a brilliant job navigating what continues to be a very difficult environment. We do expect to see continued pressure, if you will, in energy and chemicals and natural resources, I would say no different than what we saw last year.","We also continue to expect utilities to be a very strong performer for us. But on balance, when you net that together, we think it\u2019s likely that Resources is going to be below that 5% to 8% range, still flat to positive growth, but below that range. And then in the middle, we have Financial Services, H&PS and CMT. And while we continue to expect strong growth for those three operating groups in that band of 5% to 8%, for different reasons, the growth will be, let\u2019s say, lower than the strong growth that several of those operating groups delivered in 2016.","Still very healthy growth, mind you, and growth that represents taking share in the case of all three of those. But at this point in our guidance, we\u2019re not assuming that those three operating groups would deliver above the 8%. So when you say what\u2019s different, with products, it\u2019s more of the same, maybe not quite as strong as it was last year. Resources continues to have the headwinds with the two verticals in particular. And then the other three operating groups, we see right in that zone. And by the way, I think I might have said 18% for products, I meant to say 15%. I misspoke on that. So they were 15% for the year.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. So maybe just as a follow-up, just to follow through with that, just thinking about the consulting versus outsourcing for fiscal 2017, or maybe just broadly speaking, strategy versus application services, operations. Any sort of a help you can give us there, David, on what that might look like?","David Rowland","Yes, I would say that when you look out through the consulting and outsourcing lens first, so the type of work lens, we see the consulting being in the high single-digit growth, at the high single-digit level, so continued again very strong growth above the market, taking share. We see outsourcing as a type of work in the mid to high single digits. And those two combined support the 5% to 8% range.","I think probably more interesting is to talk about it through the dimensions of our businesses. We see strategy and consulting combined in the mid to high single-digit range. And again, that would represent very strong growth in that segment of the market. We see application services in the mid single-digit range. We see operations in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. And again, in The New, as I mentioned, we see continued strong double-digit growth across all three components, but let\u2019s say led by digital-related services.","Tien-Tsin Huang","All right. Good stuff. Really appreciate it. Was good to hear Pierre\u2019s voice. Thanks.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Hey. Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan Keane","Hey, David. How are you doing? Just wanted to ask, last quarter, you warned of European Financial Service weakness on the horizon, but it was actually a strength in the quarter. I think it grew double digits. So just curious on your outlook there in Europe Financial Services, and maybe just in general, a lot of headline risk in Financial Services these days. How do you see the environment going forward for you guys?","David Rowland","Yes. First of all, let me say we were quite pleased with our growth in Financial Services in Europe. We have a very strong practice. We have a strong leadership, a great team broadly. And I think it just speaks again to the differentiation that we have, in this case, in Financial Services Europe, and the extent to which they are really bringing the full power of our strategy to serve our clients, which have a variety of needs.","If I remember correctly, Pierre focused on a few demand drivers in Financial Services that continued to be present in the fourth quarter and we believe will continue to be present going forward. I mean, the first demand driver \u2013 first of all, the backdrop is, I think, as we know, Financial Services is a very technology-intensive sector, especially if you\u2019re thinking about banking and capital markets, specifically.","Within that, I would say the three demand drivers continue to be significant investment in digitizing the customer channels, so what we refer to, the sector refers to as distribution and marketing. There are significant investments to digitize the channel as a way to drive growth in the bank.","Alongside that, for reasons that we understand, there\u2019s significant focus on cost rationalization and increasing to a much higher level the cost efficiency of the bank, both to deal with, let\u2019s say, the structural pressures of a lower interest rate environment, regulatory pressures, et cetera, but also to create capacity to invest for the growth through digitizing really the enterprise but especially the channel.","And then a third driver would be risk and regulatory broadly, where we have a market-leading capability and that serves us very well. So when you look at the fourth quarter, all three of those things were at play globally but certainly in Europe. And we think we\u2019re well positioned and we think that banks, in spite of these disruptive forces, continue to have the need to invest in transforming for profitability and investing for growth. And we are well positioned to help them with that.","When you look at the backdrop of Brexit, specifically in Europe, we have not seen any material impact to date. We didn\u2019t see that in the fourth quarter and we don\u2019t see anything in the first quarter. Having said that, we along with everyone else continue to be very focused on it. The Brexit story, if you will, will play out in the months, if not years, to come.","And so we watch that very closely. We\u2019re not blind to the fact that, that could represent some risk. And we are working hard to anticipate those, should they occur, and then respond accordingly.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Helpful. And then just quick follow-ups. The lower tax rate, is that sustainable going forward, or is that just a one-year impact? And then just any thoughts on gross headcount for the year? Thanks so much and congrats.","David Rowland","Thank you very much. The tax rate - the accounting change for the tax rate for share-based compensation gives us a benefit because effectively we get a higher tax deduction when the share price at the time that a share is delivered is higher than the price at the time that the share was granted. And so in this environment, where we\u2019ve had such strong appreciation in our share price, that created the tax benefit, which as I called out, was just under 2%.","So to answer your question, will that continue over time? It will continue over time to the extent our share price continues to appreciate, such that our share price at the delivery date is higher than what it was at the time we granted. So you can take a point of view on where you think our share price will head, and then that would inform you as to whether or not that would benefit us going forward.","On the headcount, was the second part of your question, as you look forward to next year, there is an interesting evolution, if you will, on how we talk about headcount even externally. And really, as you think about our focus on these five distinct businesses, each of which has a unique talent, strategy and supply demand model, it\u2019s more nuanced, if you will, in terms of how we communicate headcount related data.","And so what I would say in general is that we have a history of hiring to meet the demand that we see in the marketplace. We do it very effectively. Our utilization for many, many quarters has been managed really at industry-leading levels.","And so as we look forward, our headcount is going to evolve in a way that meets the demand that we see in the market. And what we take comfort in is that we think talent management and our ability to access talent in the market is as good as anyone in our industry. And we feel very confident that we will secure the talent in the quantities we need to support the growth that we\u2019ve provided for in our guidance.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Thanks David.","David Rowland","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Hi, good morning, David.","David Togut","Good morning, David. Could you address your strategy to reinvent your core, and rotate the core toward digital, security and cloud over time? And in connection with that, are there any milestones we can track, just to measure your progress in this strategic transformation?","David Rowland","Yes. So that\u2019s a very good question, I\u2019m glad you asked it. And so when you use the word core, just to level set everyone, you\u2019re referring to that portion of our business that it is not in the roughly 40% we identify as in The New. So you are talking about the 60%. And I think the important point to make there and Pierre has made this point several times previously as well, is that our investment agenda and our innovation agenda covers the full scope of our business, including the 40% that we identify with The New and the 60% that we identify outside of The New.","So again, we have a very vibrant business outside of that which we identify as being digital, cloud or security. So the point is, is that we do invest to maintain vibrancy in our core business. And our goal, just as it is in The New, is to grow our core faster than the market and take share. If you look at the year that we just completed, we estimate that our core grew \u2013 had positive growth, albeit in the single-digit, low-single-digit range as by design, the vast majority of our growth comes from new, which is the essence of our strategy.","But nonetheless, our core business continued to grow and we estimate that it grew faster than the market and we took share. And we invest for that growth and we focus on it as a key part of our business. An example of that would be something that, again, I think, Pierre has referenced, Bhaskar Ghosh who leads technology has talked about this in different forums.","But an example of that would be the investment that we\u2019ve made in our myWizard, platform, which fundamentally reinvents, if you will, innovates around the way we do core application services work through the use of a automated tool that includes an intelligent agent or agents in the case of this tool, and really just helps us deliver application services work in a way that is more efficient and more effective.","When you look at, for example some of the investments that we\u2019ve made in our strategy and consulting business, while our strategy and consulting business is focused on The New, consistent with our strategy, there are parts of our strategy in consulting business that are not in that bucket that we call The New. When you look at the investments that we make in that part of our business, for example, the acquisition that we just announced of Kurt Salmon, which gives us an industry-leading strategy capability in the resell sector and it really strengthens our position there.","Certainly, a part of that investment benefits us in The New, but there\u2019s a part of that investment of that is the core strategy capability in retail that is part of the 60% that we benefit from as well. So we invest in both parts of the business and in both cases, our intent is to be a leader, to grow faster than the market and take share.","David Togut","Thanks very much, David. My thoughts are with Pierre.","David Rowland","Great. Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Good morning, Lisa. How are you?","Lisa Ellis","Hi, I am good. Thanks. Good morning, David.","David Rowland","Good.","Pierre Nanterme","Good morning.","Lisa Ellis","All right. First one, can you give a little bit of color around how - where you\u2019re seeing the maturity of some of the digital service lines at this point? Now that as you highlighted, they\u2019re $9.5 billion in revenue, meaning, is there any way to broadly characterize the digital work into build or design type of work, versus where you\u2019ve moved into full implementation or even ongoing run activities?","David Rowland","Good question. And I have to say, thanks for not asking me the margin question first. You\u2019ll ask that one, I\u2019m sure. So Lisa, what I would say is that when you look at the maturity curve for The New, and I think this applies to digital, it applies to the each of the three components within digital that we talked about, analytics, mobility and Accenture Interactive, it applies to cloud adoption and it applies to security.","I would say, across the board, universally, we are on the low end of the curve, if you will. Or to say differently, we are in the early innings of the adoption curve. And so these are ways that we think have a lot of runway in front of them. Paul Daugherty would give you a more eloquent view as our Chief Technology Officer, our Chief Technology Strategist. But I feel comfortable that he would say that, certainly this is a decade-long, if not beyond a decade-long adoption curve for these new technologies and really, the profound impact that they will each have on the way global businesses and governments operate. And so I would say we\u2019re early stage in the adoption. And this wave has a long runway in front of it.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just maybe coming at the momentum question from a little bit of a different angle. Why is it that you think that \u2013 at least the splits you were giving Tien-Tsin suggest that you at this point believe your growth may decelerate into this year, even though, as you highlighted, it\u2019s still meaningfully higher than the overall market growth. Given the momentum, though, you\u2019re describing, and the fact that these are in early stage of adoption, and The New is an increasingly large component of your base, why would you think the business would decelerate this year?","David Rowland","Well, again, I think you have to look at the fact that \u2013 I want to make sure that in the way I answer that question that I start with the fact that we feel very good about the momentum in our business and we feel very good if we work within the range that we guided to, and that would represent, we think, market-leading performance.","Now having said that, why would it be different? I don\u2019t want this to sound negative because, in fact, we\u2019re very positive. But when you think about month one of the quarter and when you think about the operating groups and the industries that have had really extraordinary double-digit growth, in many cases, not only for the last year, but for the last two years, right, as confident as we are in many of our industries, as we sit here in the first month of the year to assume that all of those industries and all of those geographic markets are going to continue at the same level of extraordinary double-digit growth for a third year in a row would just probably wouldn\u2019t be prudent.","Now does that mean that we don\u2019t have confidence in our industries? No. Does that mean that our business runners aren\u2019t working hard every day to hit the repeat button and do again what they\u2019ve done in the last two years? Absolutely not. But Pierre and I have a responsibility to be balanced and prudent in the way we set our expectations externally. And that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in our guidance. And again, that\u2019s not to say that our guidance is conservative in any way because we don\u2019t.","We think it\u2019s very good guidance in the context of the market growth and it\u2019s entirely consistent with our strategy to be a leader and grow faster than the market. But if some of these industries have strong, but let\u2019s say lower growth than they\u2019ve had the last two years, then that would put us in the 5% to 8% range. And that is the possibility in several of our industries.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rod Bourgeois of DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Hey. Good morning, Rod.","Rod Bourgeois","Hey, good morning. Hey, David. So just wanted to clarify a couple of things that seem to be assumptions in your guidance. If I understood your comments about the verticals correctly, it sounds like all of the verticals, except energy, could be somewhat weaker in its growth in fiscal 2017 versus 2016. And energy has been challenged, so it probably stays somewhat challenged. But the other verticals, it sounds like will decelerate.","And then you also mentioned that you\u2019re assuming the market rate of growth will hold up in FY2017 at the same rate as in FY2016. And so I just wanted to, one, clarify is that the assumption about the verticals, that they\u2019ll generally be somewhat slower this year than last? And then on the market, I just want to understand the assumption that it will \u2013 the growth rate will hold up at its current level. What\u2019s driving that assumption?","David Rowland","Yes. So I\u2019ll start at the end, and then work back. What\u2019s driving that assumption is that we don\u2019t see anything as we sit here today that would fundamentally change the dynamics that we see in the market, let\u2019s say, as we look out over the next four quarters. We see more of the same.","And what we see is an organic market that would continue to grow in that 2.5% range, which means that we are making our own market through our differentiation, the uniqueness of our strategy, leveraging the power of our investments to drive a level of organic growth that is meaningfully higher than that to take share. But we don\u2019t see anything that would meaningfully change that underlying organic growth of about 2.5%.","So in other words, we\u2019re not speculating on \u2013 you pick your black swan of the day, we\u2019re not speculating on some black swan event that would materially change the market. If that were to happen, all companies will be revisiting the impact of something like that, should it occur.","In terms of the \u2013 again, I almost hate to use the word deceleration because in almost all cases, our growth ambitions for the vast majority of our verticals continue to be quite strong and well above the market, albeit at lower levels than, in many cases, the very, very strong double-digit growth we\u2019ve had the last year, if not two years.","And so deceleration, what I would say for many of our verticals, we\u2019ve assumed lower but still strong growth is the way I would characterize it. Energy and chemicals and natural resources, we don\u2019t see a catalyst for change. We think those industries are going to continue to be tougher, let\u2019s say, continue to be tough as we go through the fiscal year.","As I mentioned, we have seen some pressure in communications in Europe in particular. And although we are very pleased with our growth in Financial Services, in banking and capital markets specifically, I would say that is an industry that we are watching, through Richard Lumb\u2019s leadership, we are watching very, very carefully and very closely.","Rod Bourgeois","All right. Very helpful. And two very quick one. You mentioned the acquisition contribution should be around 2% this year. Could that be 3%? And then can you just comment on your DSO outlook?","David Rowland","Yes. So the 2% would align very closely to an assumption that we spend about $1 billion, which is what we\u2019ve assumed in our capital allocation strategy, if you will. Could it be higher? As Pierre and I have said, we have the willingness and the courage, if you will, and the capacity, the fire power, to spend more than $1 billion should we have the right opportunities.","And if the right opportunities presented themselves, then we have no reservations, no concerns and complete flexibility to go above $1 billion if the circumstances were right. And so, in theory, could it go higher? It could go higher and we\u2019ll just have to see how the year plays out. A lot of it has to do with the timing of when those would occur.","Rod Bourgeois","Great. And then, yes, the DSO outlook.","David Rowland","Yes. On DSOs, we are managing to have our DSOs in the 40-day range. We had been signaling that DSOs, really, for many years, that our DSOs would tick up, but still be industry-leading. And right now, we are assuming DSOs in the 40-day range for next year.","Rod Bourgeois","Thanks.","David Rowland","Thank you very much.","KC McClure","Operator, we have time for one more question and then David will wrap up the call.","Operator","All right. Our last question will come from the line of Mr. Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead sir.","David Rowland","Hey. Good morning, Darrin.","Darrin Peller","Good morning, David. Thanks for squeezing me in. And just a quick follow-up, first on the hiring efforts. Can you give us a little more color on the distribution in terms of GDN versus on-site? Just given where you were investing in digital, I would imagine it\u2019s more distributed towards the on-site. How much has that changed over the past year? And then I just have one more quick follow-up.","David Rowland","Yes, I would say that \u2013 I mean, just in terms of color, I would say that we are investing in talent acquisition literally in every major market that we have around the world. When you look at our five businesses, you can connect the dots and see where we have more, higher growth, let\u2019s say, in strategy and consulting as an example, but not just limited to strategy and consulting, in digital, I might add.","Certainly, a lot of that talent acquisition investment is in each of the markets that we operate in around the world. I would also point out though, the digital is \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the GDN also supports and is very integral to a big part of The New. And so we are investing in differentiated skills, obviously in cloud and in security, in digital in the GDN as well. But again, we\u2019re very comfortable with our ability to acquire talent and to ramp that up as we need to as the market growth evolves throughout the year.","Darrin Peller","Okay. And just for my quick follow-up, I mean it really did sound like, from the gist of all the questions on the call that, and all your answers, that you really are not seeing any sentiment shift around the financial services vertical just yet post-Brexit, or anything else from a macro standpoint, hitting it just yet. I know you\u2019re growing over a larger base, so it\u2019s understandable, it would be a little more you prudent on outlook. But is that a fair statement, that while we\u2019ve heard a lot of your competitors calling out more conservatism or shift in strategy by their clients, you haven\u2019t seen it because of your focus on digital? Maybe any other color? Thanks.","David Rowland","Well, again I think just quickly, as we\u2019re running out of time, I would say that I can\u2019t comment on our competitors. What I can say is that the resiliency \u2013 so let me back up. A key tenet of our strategy, our growth strategy, is to create durability and resiliency in our business. And that is reflected in our focus across five businesses.","It\u2019s focused in our investments to lead in The New and it\u2019s focused and it\u2019s rooted in the focused, but diverse portfolio that we have across industries and across geographies. And whereas maybe some of our competitors, you can apply this to who you want, are more dependent on one or two or three verticals and one or two markets, that\u2019s not the case with Accenture. And that is, in fact, the differentiator and probably colors our comments in our results versus some of our competitors, all of whom we respect, but yet we think we are differentiated for the reasons that I mentioned.","Again, in addition to chemicals and energy and natural resources, we\u2019ve got our eye on communications, in Europe in particular. And while we haven\u2019t seen any impacts at this point in banking and capital markets, we\u2019re not blind to the dynamics of the Brexit and how it could evolve. And Richard Lumb, who is our Group Chief Executive for Financial Services, is very focused on staying on top of that, and we\u2019ll see how it plays out, but I would say, so far, so good.","Darrin Peller","Okay. Thanks, David","End of Q&A","David Rowland","Right. Thank you very much. Okay, so let me just close out the call and thank everyone again for joining us on the call. Hope you found it helpful and insightful. As we enter fiscal 2017, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum in our business, with the differentiated capabilities we are building, our continued rotation to The New and our disciplined management of the business, we are very confident in our ability to continue gaining market share and driving profitable growth.","On behalf of Pierre and our entire leadership team, I want to thank all Accenture people around the world for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our clients in our business and to delivering another excellent year. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out to KC.

As the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.","On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chief Executive Officer, and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call.","Julie will begin with an overview of our results.

As a company and the leadership team, we focus every day on delivering on our commitments and creating value for our clients. And today, we are proud to announce that we have delivered another year of outstanding financial results, meeting or exceeding each of the objectives we laid out in our initial fiscal 2019 business outlook.","And I know that Pierre, our Chairman and CEO, who passed away in January would've been very proud of the accomplishments this year of our nearly 500,000 people, including more than 7,000 outstanding managing directors.","I would like to add a special thank you to David Rowland for his inspiring and exceptional leadership during these past several months and to our entire Global Management Committee who came together under David's leadership to ensure that we delivered on our commitments and which also was the ultimate way to honor Pierre and his incredible contribution to Accenture.","Let me share a few highlights for the year. We generated record new bookings of $45.5 billion, including our highest ever quarterly bookings of $12.9 billion in Q4.","Revenues for the year were $43.2 billion, an 8.5% increase in local currency. We delivered earnings per share of $7.36, a 9% increase on an adjusted basis.","Operating margin was 14.6%, an expansion of 20 basis points.","We generated outstanding free cash flow of $6 billion. We returned $4.6 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we just announced our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share, which reflects a 10% increase over the equivalent quarterly rate last year. ","We have demonstrated once again the durability and resilience of our business and the strong demand for our services positions us very well for fiscal 2020.","Now, let me hand over to KC who will review the numbers in greater detail. KC?","KC McClure","Thank you, Julie. And thanks to all of you for taking time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes another outstanding year for Accenture.","Our results continue to provide strong validation of our leadership position in the marketplace, our relevance to clients, and our ability to manage our business in a dynamic environment, all to deliver significant value to our clients, our people, and our shareholders.","Once again, our fourth-quarter results reflect our constant focus to deliver strong and consistent financial results across our three key imperatives for driving superior shareholder value. So, let me summarize a few important highlights before I get into the details.","Revenue growth of 7.2% in local currency continued to be highlighted by strong double-digit growth in all three areas of the New, including digital, cloud, and security-related services. Growth continued to be broad based with the vast majority of our industries at high-single to double-digit growth levels. We continue to extend our leadership position with growth at about 2 times the market. ","Operating margin was 14.2% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points, resulting in 20 basis points expansion for the full year. Importantly, we delivered this expansion while investing at record levels in our business and in our people to position us for long-term market leadership. ","We delivered very strong EPS of $1.74, which represents 10% growth even with an FX headwind of about 2%. ","And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $1.9 billion, which surpassed our expectations driven by our strong growth in profitability and continued superior DSO management. ","Now, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were a record $12.9 billion for the quarter and surpassed our previous all-time high by over $1 billion. We had very strong overall book-to-bill of 1.2. ","Consolidated bookings were $6.1 billion, with a book to bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $6.8 billion, with a book to bill of 1.4. We were extremely pleased with our bookings this quarter, which were broad based and strong across many dimensions of our business.","They continue to be dominated by high demand for digital, cloud, and security-related services which we estimate represented more than 65% of our new bookings.","For the full fiscal year, we delivered $45.5 billion in new bookings. These record bookings reflect the relevance of our services and the high level of trust our clients place in us as their partner.","Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, a 5% increase in US dollars and 7.2% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.2 billion, up 5% in US dollars and 7% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $4.9 billion, up 6% in US dollars and 8% in local currency.","Looking at the trends in estimated revenue growth across our business dimensions, technology services posted strong high-single-digit growth, strategy and consulting services grew mid-single digits, and operations continued its trend of double-digit growth. ","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, resources delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth at 12% in local currency. Growth continued to be strong across all three industries and all three geographies.","Products grew 8%, reflecting continued strength in our largest operating group. We had strong growth across all three geographies and very strong double-digit growth in life sciences.","H&PS grew 8% this quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in health and strong growth in public service. We were especially pleased with the strong growth in both growth markets and North America, with North America benefiting from continued strong growth in our US federal business.","Communications, Media, & Technology grew 5%, reflecting double-digit growth in software and platforms. And overall, we saw double-digit growth in Europe and strong growth in growth markets.","Finally, Financial Services delivered 4% growth, in line with our expectations. Insurance again grew double-digits, and we saw continued improvement in banking and capital markets globally. Overall, Financial Services delivered double-digit growth in growth markets, strong growth in North America, partially offset by contraction in Europe.","Turning to geographic dimensions of our business, I am very pleased with the continued demand across all three of our geographic regions, which illustrates the diversity of the business that continues to serve us well.","In North America, we delivered 8% revenue growth in local currency, driven by continued strong growth in the United States. In Europe, revenues grew 4% in local currency, with double-digit growth in Italy and Ireland and high-single-digit growth in the Netherlands.","And we delivered another very strong quarter in growth markets, with 12% growth in local currency led by Japan which again had very strong double-digit growth. We had double-digit growth in China and Singapore, as well as high-single-digit growth in Brazil. ","Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.1% compared with 30.8% for the same period last year.","Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.6% compared with 10.4% for the fourth quarter last year.","General and administrative expense was 6.2% compared to 6.5% for the same quarter last year.","Operating income was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.2% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter four last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 28.0% for the fourth quarter last year.","Diluted earnings per share were $1.74 compared with EPS of $1.58 in the fourth quarter last year. ","Days service outstanding were 40 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 39 days in the fourth quarter of last year.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion net of property and equipment additions of $241 million.","Our cash balance at August 31 was $6.1 billion compared with $5.1 billion at August 31 last year.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.1 million shares for $407 million at an average price of $189.78 per share. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share to be paid on November 15, a 10% increase over the equivalent quarterly rate last year.","Now, I would like to take up few minutes to summarize our outstanding year. And as Julie mentioned, we were extremely pleased that we successfully executed our business to meet or exceed all aspects of our original outlook that we provided last September. ","Revenue growth of 8.5% in local currency for the full year was above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of our fiscal year. This result is a strong indication of the durability and resilience of our growth model, which is underpinned by our focus on achieving market-leading scale across key industries, geographic markets and services. This includes our strategic focus to lead in the new, which represents approximately 65% of revenues for the year.","Operating margin of 14.6% reflected a 20 basis point expansion over FY 2018 and was aligned with our original outlook.","The diluted earnings per share was $7.36, reflecting 9% growth over adjusted FY 2018 EPS and was above our original guided range. As a reminder, in fiscal year 2018, EPS was adjusted to exclude the impact of tax law changes.","Free cash flow of $6.0 billion was well above our original guided range, reflecting a free cash flow to net income ratio of more than 1.2, driven by strong profitability and continued industry-leading DSOs.","And finally, we exceeded our objectives for capital allocation by returning $4.6 billion of cash to shareholders, while investing roughly $1.2 billion across 33 acquisitions to acquire critical skills and capabilities in strategic high-growth areas of the market. ","So, again, we had a truly outstanding year and we feel really good about our positioning as we head into fiscal 2020.","Now, let me turn it back to Julie.","Julie Sweet ","Thank you, KC. Our strong results reflect the power of our growth strategy. Our strategy starts with what our clients need. And our clients need to transform their entire enterprise. ","What we see is that most of our clients are still in the very early stages of their transformation journeys. The starting points and speed are different by industry and by company, but the scope of the ambition is consistently broad.","Our fiscal 2019 results reflect the strong demand for our services and the significant growth opportunities in front of us.","I am extremely pleased that we finished the year with 200 diamond clients, which represents our largest relationships with many of the world's most iconic companies.","I'm also proud to share with you that, in fiscal year 2019, Accenture Interactive achieved a significant milestone, reaching over $10 billion in revenue.","And finally, this quarter, we had 16 clients with new bookings over $100 million. ","Clients choose Accenture for their largest and most complex transformation programs because they know we are uniquely positioned to create value by combining our unparalleled technology expertise, our privileged ecosystem relationships, our focus on innovation and our broad industry depth. ","Our proven track record of global implementations at scale, coupled with our capabilities from strategy to operations, create significant value for our clients.","Let me double-click on a few of these important elements of our business, starting with our deep technology expertise and our privileged ecosystem relationships.","Transformation for our clients begins with their understanding that technology is core to their business. And they turn to us because technology is core to our business.","The depth, breath and scale of our technology expertise, combined with the power of our deep ecosystem relationships where we are a leading partner with all the key players, is critical to being our client's partner of choice.","Another element I want to highlight is our deep and broad industry expertise across our 13 diverse industry groups. This breath has always provided us durability and resilience in our business.","And today, it has created another competitive advantage. CEOs are increasingly looking to benchmark themselves against the best companies regardless of industry and they are turning to us for our cross-industry expertise.","Because we bring both deep industry expertise in their industry as well as across other industries, we can help drive even more value at speed for our clients.","Let me bring this to life with an example of a solution that we originally developed for the communication industry and are now using to accelerate value in other industries.","For comms companies, building out their network and providing excellent customer service across all channels are the biggest imperatives. We helped Verizon use artificial intelligence, coupled with our deep understanding of the industry, to create digital assistant experiences at scale that can now address more than 70% of Verizon's calls.","In many cases, a 20-minute call with an agent has been reduced to a 3 to 4-minute digital interaction, significantly improving the customer experience. Verizon's agents have enhanced their skills and now have more time to handle the most complex calls, which is also the most interesting work.","As you can imagine, call centers represent a significant opportunity to drive value in many industries. Recognizing this, we were able to tailor our solution to the unique needs of our clients in both utilities and public service.","At Enbridge, the global energy company, we implemented a solution in their gas utility operations to address inquiries similar to Verizon's, such as billing questions and service changes, to improve their customer experience. Now callers are able to complete many transactions digitally and customer satisfaction is up significantly.","And the New Mexico Human Services Department is using our solution to help employees answer questions about Medicaid faster and more accurately. For example, the state has reduced the time it takes to complete the process of providing Medicaid coverage to newborn babies by up to 75% and our solution has freed up employees to focus on more complex tasks, enhancing their experience as well.","Let me wrap up by talking a bit more about our people and the inclusiveness of our culture. Our people and culture are our biggest competitive advantage and our unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity enables us to recruit the most talented people in our markets. This creates an environment which unleashes innovation and allows our people to perform at their very best.","Today, I am announcing yet another milestone on our path to gender equality by 2025. With nearly 500,000 people around the world and as a technology powerhouse, we are now 44% women. ","In addition to gender, we are focused on leading in all areas of inclusion and diversity, and I'm proud to announce that, for the second year in a row, we have been ranked number one on Refinitiv's Diversity and Inclusion Index, which was previously produced by Thomson Reuters, and identifies the 100 publicly traded companies around the world with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces based on environmental, social and governance data from more than 7,000 companies.","With that, I'll turn it over to KC to provide our fiscal 2020 business outlook. KC?","KC McClure ","Thanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to be in the range of $10.9 million to $11.2 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year 2020, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be approximately negative 1% compared to fiscal 2019.","For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal 2019.","For operating margins, we expect fiscal year 2020 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 basis point to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal 2019 results. ","We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 22.5% in fiscal 2019.","For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2020 to be in the range of $7.62 to $7.84 or 4% to 7% growth over fiscal 2019 results. ","For the full fiscal 2020, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.75 billion., property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and our free cash flow to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2.","Finally, we expect to return at least $4.8 billion through dividends and share purchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","And with that, let's open it up, so we can take your questions. Angie?","Angie Park ","Thanks, KC. I would ask that you would each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Kevin, would you provide instructions for those on the call? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. First question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang, JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay, thanks. Good morning. No surprises on the outlook. But I do want to ask on the bookings here. So, outsourcing bookings were strong. You said that large deals did come through. You suggested that it would, which is great. But on the consulting bookings side, that was flattish for the \u2013 I guess, I\u2019m looking at the second half of the year, so can we expect a rotation here perhaps into more outsourcing revenue and maybe bookings, looking at your fiscal 2020? Can you give us maybe your views on outsourcing versus consulting growth in fiscal 2020?","Julie Sweet","Sure. So, thanks, Tien-tsin, for the question. Maybe, I'll start with the last part of your question. In terms of how we're thinking about growth in fiscal 2020 for consulting and outsourcing, we expect for the full year that growth for consulting and outsourcing, they'll both be in the mid-to-high, single-digit range, and that's baked within our 5% to 8% guidance for the year. ","And taking your booking questions, as you mentioned, we had record bookings for this quarter, $12.9 billion. And if you peel that back and look at our consulting bookings, we also had bookings at $6.1 billion in consulting type of work, and that's one of our highest booking quarters ever, and it was out of our book-to-bill target of 1.0 or higher. ","And I think importantly, Tien-tsin, as well, we feel really good about the pipeline that we have as we enter in the beginning parts of fiscal 2020, and we say that on an overall broad base in terms of all aspects of our business. ","And so, when you peel that back and you look at overall what we've done in terms of our bookings for the fourth quarter in consulting, our overall bookings at $12.9 billion, a record, as well as our strong pipeline as we head into fiscal 2020, we still see \u2013 we see balanced growth across both types of work.","Operator","Okay. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Bryan Bergin","Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up just on that booking question. It seems like the variability quarter to quarter has become more volatile. Can you just talk about the major drivers of that and is that something that we should expect to continue in fiscal 2020? ","Julie Sweet","Yeah, in terms of our bookings, I think if you take a look at how we position bookings and think of it from a quarterly basis, and we've said this kind of historically, they can be lumpy from quarter to quarter. And really what we're looking at in terms of our overall booking is that we meet on a prolonged period our bookings targets, which for consulting or anything from 1.0 and above which we did this year and this quarter, and for outsourcing which tends to be 1.1 and above over a prolonged period. In this quarter, we did 1.4. So, we expect that there will be some variability. You saw that certainly this year where we had really strong bookings in quarter two. We had it a little bit lighter as it relates to the rest of the full year and quarter three, and we signal that based on our pipeline, we thought that we would have very strong bookings in Q4, and indeed we did. So, that's something that we're very used to.","As we think about FY 2020, we tend sometimes to have \u2013 Q1 might be a little bit of a lighter bookings in relation to the rest of the quarter, but again this \u2013 coming off a particularly very strong year, in quarter four, that may be the case as well for this year, but we feel very strong \u2013 we feel very good about our strong pipeline as we enter into 2020.","Bryan Bergin","Okay, thanks. And then just a follow-up here on your talent and resourcing model, as you approach 500,000 employees, can you talk about what you're doing to reduce the manual effort around work? I think in the past, you disclosed automated FTE or efforts within your operations group. So, any update you can provide there? And it's in the context of just the uptick that we saw in attrition to 19% and your comfort levels there? Thanks.","Julie Sweet","I'll let KC address the specific uptick around the attrition, but let me give you a broader perspective on how we look at talent. So, one of our greatest strengths, right, is how we manage talent and people. And so, if you look at it at any given time, we are always adjusting the use of technology in our business and the talent that we then need to hire. And so, we have talked about it in the context of our operations business. But when you think about the work that we do in technology with our myWizard platform where we're using the latest in artificial intelligence and analytics to help our clients, that was work that, five years ago, we used people. And so, we don't think about this as a particular sort of strategy to do X, but that at any given time, we are continuously innovating how we are giving services and then adjusting what that means for our talent, and we do that really seamlessly quarter to quarter and year to year.","KC McClure","And, Bryan, just to answer your question on the actual attrition number, we did have a slight uptick this quarter by about 1%, but we feel good about the strong retention rates that we have in key strategic areas of our business, and that includes areas such as our digital practice as well as strategy and consulting. As you know, we really have no issues in attracting the people that we need, and people choose Accenture because of our strategy, our strong financial performance, and the experience that we provide to our people, continuous learning, the amount of investments we make in training and innovation, and it really does make Accenture one of the best places to build a career. ","Operator","And next we have David Togut of Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Togut","Thank you. Good to see the bookings strength. I'd like to ask about any changes you're seeing in average contract length, especially given the ongoing strength in outsourcing bookings and possibly in the evolution of your shift to the new \u2013 are you in more of an operating and run stage with a lot of bigger clients?","KC McClure","Hi, David. There's really no change to the duration of our contract and our bookings. No change.","Julie Sweet","David, I would think about \u2013 really think about what we're seeing in the business because really our clients are focusing on enterprise-wide transformation. And what that requires is that we bring all of our capabilities together, really from strategy to operations. And you saw that on the bookings we had this last quarter of 16 clients with over $100 million. And just to give you an example, we're working in products with \u2013 one of those was a products company, Fortune Global 100 who is transforming HR using everything from our strategy capabilities to our operations capabilities to transform the experience from hiring to retirement and, at the same time, drive down costs. And our competitive advantage in this market is that we are able to bring all of those capabilities. And what we're seeing is that boards and CEOs are really focusing on the enterprise-wide transformation which means large and strategic programs which is what we are very uniquely positioned to deliver.","David Togut","Understood. Just as a quick follow-up, you announced a leadership change Tuesday at the head of your Products group, your largest operating group. What changes should we expect with Simon Eaves taking over Products leadership?","Julie Sweet","That's going to be a very seamless transition to Simon. He's been working in Products for most of his career and brings the deep both \u2013 industry, operational and sales expertise. So, that should be very seamless.","David Togut","And next, we have questions from the line of Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about digital. If I look inside the new, digital appeared to be slowing a little bit more than cloud and security. It's off its high growth rate in fiscal year 2018. So, just thinking about it, is digital getting more penetrated or more competitive inside there? I know it's still growing robustly at, looks like, high teens, maybe low 20%, but it is off of the growth rate that it was growing at previously. So, we always get questions about penetration there. Thanks.","KC McClure","Yeah. Sure, Bryan. I'll answer the questions on the growth rate. I'll hand it over to Julie to talk about what's happening within the digital business. So, digital, in terms of what we estimate for the full year, we estimate digital to be about $21 billion business. So, it's very significant in terms of scale. It's about 50%, almost pushing 50% of our overall revenue base. So, with that scale, as you mentioned in terms of growth, we are at the very high teens in terms of growth rate. So, we're really pleased with what we're seeing in the continued, very strong, high-teen double-digit growth that we have in digital. And we expect that, as we look into next year, that overall we will have \u2013 in the new, we'll continue, which includes digital, to have double-digit growth overall in FY 2020.","Julie Sweet","I think, Bryan, it is important to look at, again, what our clients are doing when we think about where we are in our growth strategy. As I said earlier, we do see our clients at the very early stages of their transformation. And so, really think about what is happening in three buckets. ","The first is, they are building out their digital core, right, which is establishing the technology foundation. And so, in the scale parts of our business, intelligence platform services, which is all about the next gen platform, that's 40% of our business today growing double-digits because they need \u2013 our clients need to establish that new foundation that's going to fuel the enterprise transformation.","At the same time in the digital core, we're still in the early stages of scaling areas like data, right, how our clients are going to be able to find and curate that data which is just really beginning when you think about how much data there is, security which is only at $2.5 billion and then the move to the cloud.","So, within building the digital core, we have scale plays like intelligent platform services growing double-digits and then we have the next scale plays which are also growing double-digit.","Then the second big area our clients are focused on is driving the growth agenda which is all about creating better customer experiences which is fueling Accenture Interactive, which hit $10 billion this year, but it's also fueling the focus on new products and services which is what X.O is about. That's at very early stages, right, having connected products and services. And so, that will be the next area that we are really focused on scaling in the growth agenda.","And then, the third area is in optimizing their operations. And again, scale part of our business, operations, which is growing double-digit, right, and that's because it helps our clients reduce costs to increase their investment capacity, but it also enables our clients to do the transformation because we have invested in operations to use machine learning and other forms of emerging technologies, and so they are accessing those technologies through our platform in operations.","But then, at the same time, right, you have again X.O where we're seeing the early stages of digitizing manufacturing and creating the connected plant, which will be the next play that we are scaling, right?","And then, of course, at any given time, we're in the innovation space and we're looking at the emerging technologies that will fuel growth. But in each of the areas of what our clients are doing, we have scale today growing double-digits and then we have the next plays that we're scaling.","Bryan Keane","That's helpful. I just had one follow-up for KC. On tax rate, I see tax rates going up, looks like, about 100 basis points to 300 basis points and I know there's some moving pieces in terms of tax rate. So, can you just talk about what are the factors we should be considering there for tax in this fiscal year?","KC McClure","Sure, Bryan. So, our range, just to maybe to anchor to where we're starting with, so our range for fiscal 2020 is up about 0.5 point compared to where we started last year for fiscal 2019. And the increase from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the US tax reform provision that phased in over two years. And as a reminder, there are four factors that I think you probably know well, but just might bear repeating, that can influence our tax rate in any given year. And the first one is our geographic mix of our income. Second is the changes in our prior-year tax liability. The third is our final determinations. And the fourth is the tax impacts on our equity compensation.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is from the line of Harshita Rawat of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Harshita Rawat","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My question is for you, Julie. Given your background in M&A and what's happening in the marketplace, should we expect Accenture to potentially look at larger deals now versus the tuck-ins you've done historically? ","And then, as a follow-up to that question, over the last couple of years, you've done a lot of acquisitions on Accenture Interactive. So, going forward, what we should we expect is the focus of your M&A activity?","Julie Sweet","Thanks for the question. Harshita, let me start with the overall strategy around acquisitions, which is, while it served us extremely well and we think about acquisitions to do three things, to scale hot areas in the market. So, for example, this year, we did about six acquisitions in technology, three of them in particular around intelligent platform services where I've already talked about, we're seeing double-digit growth and we need to \u2013 we wanted to help scale our capabilities.","The second is to add new capabilities. And this has been a lot of our acquisitions in the new, which has been about 20 of the acquisitions that have been in digital and security, particularly as you pointed out in Accenture Interactive. And so, that is all about adding new capabilities.","And then, the third is really getting deeper industry and functional expertise. And so, this year, we did four in the area of financial services where we really expanded our expertise in that industry through these acquisitions. So, you should expect that our strategy is always going to around those three areas, and that it is meant to fuel our organic growth. ","Now, with respect to whether we would do a larger acquisition, we've always said that we could do a larger acquisitions, but it would really need to make sense for us in the context of what we look to acquisitions to do. So, there are certainly no plans to do that, but, obviously, we have the capability if that ever made sense.","And then, finally, as we think about going forward, well, certainly, Accenture Interactive is an important focus point and we've done a lot of acquisitions there. As you think about where we're scaling, right, so the next scale plays, like X.O, you should expect to see that we're going to focus in that area as well.","And so, at each year, we're going to look at where we need to either scale, add new capabilities or add industry expertise. And it'll really change based on what we're seeing in the market and what's available.","Harshita Rawat","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next question is from line of Keith Bachman, Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Please go ahead.","Keith Bachman","Hi. Thank you very much. Julie, I'd like to direct this first one to you. And that's, how do you think about Accenture's business line related to more challenging economic cycles? And to put a little more context on the question, it would seem to me that operations is pretty resilient if, in fact, the economy got tougher. The one I question is strategy and consulting rather. And if I look back to 2009 when the economy got really tough, the strategy and consulting element declined double-digits. And so, if we look at out the next year or two, if we hit more difficult economic times, how is strategy and consulting different today that it might be more or less immune from economic cycles? And I have quick follow-up for KC.","Julie Sweet","Sure. Well, if we sort of take a step back and think about what have we been trying to achieve over the last five years, and that has been our rotation to the new, meaning focusing on the most relevant services that our clients need to transform their businesses. So, our strategy and consulting business today, right, is focused on these new services, how do you take blockchain and apply it to Financial Services, how do you use data and combine it with deep customer insights and use the skills of an Accenture Interactive to create a different customer experience. And we believe that, in a downturn scenario, our relevance to our clients comes in the fact that they are still going to need \u2013 and, in fact, we think, during that time, even more so to use these capabilities that we have in order to drive their growth agenda, optimize their operations and, of course, still build the digital core. And so, that's where we see the resilience of our current business model.","Keith Bachman","Okay. All right, thank you. And, KC, just a quick one for you. On the cash flow, particularly operating cash flow, looks like CapEx is up a little bit, but if I focus on operating cash flow, you're guiding it to be more or less flattish year-over-year. And while I understand that your cash flow metrics on guidance are almost an output, but is there anything you wanted to call out as being unusual that would make the year-over-year comparisons on operating cash flow a little more challenging or either pluses or minuses on the operating cash flow? And that's it for me. Thank you.","KC McClure","Thanks, Keith. In terms of operating cash flow in our overall free cash flow, there's a minor uptick, $50 million in capital expenditures. So, that's not really very different. But really, the way we look at our free cash flow is the goal that we have is for it to be over \u2013 at 1 or better in terms of percentages, the ratio to net income. And so, with our guidance this year, we're actually at 1.1t to 1.2. So, that's outstanding. Another year of outstanding free cash flow. ","Now, this year, in FY 2019, we did above 1.2. And why did we do even better? And what are the influences that can put us in one place or the other? It really has to do with a couple items that I would point out. And this year in particular, we had significant outstanding performance continuing in our DSO. And so, for every day of DSO, it's about 130, give or take, to our free cash flow. So, we always assume at the beginning of the year that we give ourselves a little bit of room to stay in the low 40s because that would still be outstanding within our business.","And I'll just point out maybe a couple of other things that influence the fourth quarter, for example. The timing of things such as cash tax payments and just overall timing of accounts payable, those are things that can really change our \u2013 the timing of our free cash flow. But for next year, we have just another stellar free cash flow performance baked into our guidance at 1.1 to 1.2. And we continue to be very proud of how we operate our business in that respect.","Keith Bachman","Many thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois, DeepDive Equity. Please go ahead.","Rod Bourgeois","Hey, there. And welcome, Julie. Julie, I just wanted to ask a big picture question here. Do you have any strategic changes or major priorities that you plan to implement as you take the helm?","Julie Sweet","Rod, our strategy starts with our clients. And so, we are going to continue to stay focused on our clients. And so, there's no change \u2013 no major change in our strategy because a new CEO doesn't change our clients. So\u2026","Rod Bourgeois","Got it. And is there anything significant happening in any of the verticals that may change the vertical mix as you move into next year? It looks like the range of growth outcomes that you're getting across your verticals has narrowed some. Some of the really high performers has slowed and some of the weaker performers has improved. So, are the vertical performances next year prone to be more parity or could the spread widen?","KC McClure","Thanks, Rod. This is KC. I would say that, in terms of our verticals, if you're obviously talking about our operating groups, within our range of 5% to 8%, we see that all of them have the ability to be within that range. And, certainly, the opportunity exists also for some of them [indiscernible 0:46:22] resources in particular to perform above that range.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Jamie Friedman, Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Jamie Friedman","First, thank you for all these incremental disclosures. They are very helpful. The observation about the diamond clients, the $100 million, the decomposition of the growth, it's all appreciated. I just want to ask you briefly about the business dimension of strategy consulting. So, that dimension, I'm looking at the bottom left corner, the Q4, so the purple grid, so the mid-single digit growth for the Q4 did trend just below the flipside, which was high-single digit growth for that dimension for the year. And I know each quarter can be lumpy, but any expectation about that staying here or potentially accelerating that's contemplated in the guidance would be helpful?","KC McClure","Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. In terms of our overall strategy and consulting business, as you mentioned, it's $14 billion is what we estimate that business to have been in the fiscal year that we just closed, 2019. It's a little bit less than \u2013 it's right around a third of our business. And at that scale, we're really pleased when we have growth in mid to high single digits range. And so, for the year, we see that it was high-single digits for this quarter and Q4 and we saw that it was mid. But we're happy when it's in the mid-to-high-single digit range. And as you mentioned, it will lap from quarter to quarter. But I think it's important and as Julie \u2013 just picking up on some of the things that Julie talked about, as you know, that consulting and strategy, it's a really important capability because that helps us drive value across the C suite, not only in the role of delivering pure strategy and advisory work to clients to shape their transformation agenda, but also to bring the entire full scope of Accenture's transformation capabilities, including technology, industry, all at a global scale. And as Julie put it on her examples as well as with our 16 clients at over $100 million, we saw that really in evidence this quarter as well. So, it's a bit of a dual purpose that we have in strategy and consulting advisory work. And we're really pleased with overall \u2013 our performance in the year, our performance in the quarter. And we feel that, with the bookings that we had in Q4, $6.1 billion which was in consulting type of work overall, but a portion of that obviously within consolidating in strategy, and we feel well-positioned in this regard for fiscal 2020.","Jamie Friedman","Okay. Thanks, KC. And then, I just wanted to ask about operation, so incredible double-digit growth again above company average, above the industry. So, I know you shared some already, but any texture there would be helpful. Can we keep that up? And is that contemplated in the guide? Thank you.","KC McClure","Yeah. So, Jamie, yes, we're really proud of what we \u2013 what Debbie and the team have been able to do in operations over the last years where they continue to have double-digit growth. And for next year, for operations, we do see that that will continue probably and maybe in the high single to the low double-digit growth range is what we see in operations.","Julie Sweet","And just to take a minute to expand on why operations is so strategic for us and for our clients, and it really is for two reasons. So, first of all, operations is a great and proven way to create value for our clients because it helps them reduce costs, create more investment capacity, but the operations business today is very different than, say, even five years ago because we have invested to bring these great technologies to the platform which we call SynOps. And if you are a CEO and you think about where do I want to build my own capabilities around artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. Do I want to do that in order to transform finance or HR or the marketing backbone? Or do I want to do that in places that are going to truly differentiate me in terms of my products, for example? And the equation is often, well, why don't we go to Accenture that is built to have platform, that's doing it across hundreds of clients with deep and long expertise in the enterprise and access that technology to transform how we're doing those functions, so that I can put my investments into these other areas that are going to differentiate us in the market. And that is really helping drive the next wave of growth for operations. And we think that's going to be even more important as we see this enterprise-wide transformation.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, good morning, guys. Can you just tell us how much M&A contribution you're expecting in the fiscal 2020 revenue growth? And can we also just get a follow-up comment on the tax rate with the increase in 2020? Is that the new normal we should be thinking about in, call it, medium term just based on the phase in of the tax law changes?","KC McClure","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. In terms of the contribution that we have assumed in FY 2020 in our 5% to 8% guidance range, it's about 2% inorganic which is around the same as we land in FY 2019.","In terms of our tax rates, maybe again, I will just answer that. Our range is only up 50 basis points from where we started the year and there's various things that can impact our tax rate throughout the year. So, not really in a very different space from where we started last year. But you're right that this is \u2013 in FY 2020, we have phased in the US tax reform provision that phased in over two years. So, we do think that that's really where our rate will be for this year. I'm not going to guide to \u2013 you know we don't guide to out years on our tax rate. But we will then work our four other factors that can influence our tax rate overall, but we do have, in 2019 to 2020, the second-year phasing of the US tax reform.","Jason Kupferberg","On attrition, just to come back to that, I know you guys aren't having any issue attracting the talent that you want\/need, but should we expect just in light of the generally tight labor markets, especially for digital talent, that this kind of high teens ZIP code is just sort of a new normal?","KC McClure","Yeah. So, Jason, I don't think there's anything that you should expect that's different than what you've seen, and you've followed for a long time, than we've had in the past. We're in the higher teens to mid-teens in attrition. That's a level that, historically, we feel we can manage and that's how we build our business. So, there's nothing that you should expect as very different and nothing that we're concerned about.","Angie Park","Okay, great. Kevin, we have time for one more question and then Julie will wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you. And that question is from line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Good morning, guys. A question on outsourcing bookings again. Just didn't follow-up, I think, from Tien-tsin's question opening the call. The Accenture of old, we'd always think of Accenture's outsourcing business being heavily things like ERP management and whatnot, but that is clearly not what it is now. Can you decompose a little bit what makes up outsourcing at this point? Is this like managing clouds on behalf of clients? Is this a lot of digital marketing ongoing management? Just give a sense for what's underneath there. Thank you.","Julie Sweet","Lisa, it's interesting is that the breadth of what we do there is actually not different. It's just how we're doing it. So, for example, we're still doing application outsourcing, but we're doing it using dev ops and Agile and something we call living systems because it's a different way of doing application outsourcing that's allowing the application outsourcing that we do for our clients to help drive their business transformations. We have, of course, a $6 billion business in operations. And again, the kinds of functions in that we're doing are similar, although we've added marketing and scaled marketing over the last couple of years. But, again, it's how we're doing it. It used to be about labor arbitrage 10 years ago. It's very, very different now. And so, the breadth in terms of the activities that we're going after has not changed. What makes it so successful for us is that we've evolved how we do it.","And so, you can see application outsourcing, because of the techniques we're using, is now helping our clients get to things like Agile and dev ops at scale and be able to help drive their business differently.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thanks. And then, quick follow-up for KC on the guide. One more guidance question. Can you articulate what macro outlook for 2020 is embedded in the guidance? And then, realizing it's still September, are you seeing enough visibility into budget outlooks and stuff for next year that you're feeling \u2013 what's your confidence level around that macro outlook? Thank you.","KC McClure","Thanks, Lisa. And as you mentioned, this is, obviously, obvious point. At the beginning of the year, this is our longest range of time that we're giving an outlook. But with that, as you know, we guided to 5% to 8% growth for next year. And that contemplates a market that we see growing about the same as it has done in 2019. So, for us, for our addressable market, we think it's probably somewhere in the 3% to 4% range overall for next year.","Julie Sweet","So, thanks again for joining us on today's call. KC and I and the entire team are extremely pleased with our excellent performance for fiscal 2019. We see significant opportunity ahead and we are laser focused on delivering value for all of our stakeholders. ","And let me end by thanking our stakeholders, thanking our clients for placing their trust in us, our investors for their continued confidence, our ecosystem partners for their shared commitment to our clients, our exceptional leadership team and, finally, all of our people around the world. You are what makes Accenture so special.","I'll see everyone on the road. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference.

Our very strong results demonstrate that we\u2019re executing a growth strategy that is both highly relevant to our clients and highly differentiating for our country. David will provide more detail in a moment but here are a few highlights from the quarter.","We delivered new bookings of $7.7 billion in line with our expectations. We grew revenues 10% in local currency gaining significant market share. We delivered outstanding earnings per share of $1.29 a 12% increase. We delivered operating margin of 15% to 20 basis point expansion. We generated very strong free cash flow of $821 million and continued to have a rock solid balance sheet ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4.5 billion. And we returned $1.3 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semi-annual dividend of $1.2 per share, a 10% increase over our previous year.","So we are off to a very good start in fiscal year \u201815 and we have raised our outlook for revenue growth for the full fiscal year.","Now let me hand over to David, who will review the numbers in greater detail. David over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you Pierre happy holidays to all of you and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As you heard in Pierre\u2019s comments we delivered a very strong first quarter building further in the momentum that we established in the second half of last year. Just a few months ago at our investor analyst day I outlined our focus on three imperatives for delivering shareholder value and certainly our quarter one results and the updated guidance that I will provide shortly illustrate our ability to manage and drive our business in a differentiated way.","So before I get into the details let\u2019s look at our results in the context of the three imperatives. Starting with durable revenue growth we expanded our business by over $500 million in the quarter with 10% growth in local currency. We had positive growth across all operating groups with four of the five achieving double-digit growth, strong balanced growth across all three geographic areas and the highest growth rates in over two years in both consulting and outsourcing.","With respect to sustainable margin expansion we expanded operating margin by 20 basis points while at the same time investing in our business. The actions that we put in place during the second half of last year are yielding results and while optimizing profitability requires an ongoing relentless focus, we\u2019re very encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made in recent quarters. ","And finally regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation we generated over 800 million in free cash flow and delivered roughly 1.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.","With that said let\u2019s now turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were 7.7 billion with consulting bookings of 3.9 billion and a book to bill of 0.9 and outsourcing bookings of 3.8 billion and a book to bill of 1.0. This level of new bookings is consistent with what we signaled on the September earnings call that bookings would be lighter in quarter one and then build throughout the year. We\u2019re pleased with the composition of our new bookings specifically with the portion of our new bookings which we expect to be recognized as revenues this fiscal year which improved our revenue visibility and supported increasing our revenue guidance for the full year. We see positive trends in our overall pipeline and are well positioned to deliver a higher level of bookings in the second quarter.","Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were 7.9 billion, an increase of 7% U.S. dollars and 10% local currency, reflecting a negative 3% FX impact compared to the negative 2% impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. On both an FX adjusted and unadjusted basis, we were well above the top end of our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were 4.1 billion, up 4% in USD and 7% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were 3.8 billion, up 11% in USD and 14% in local currency.","Before I cover the operating groups, let me provide some insight on the primary drivers of our growth in the quarter. Digital related services continue to be a growth engine and contributed very significantly to our overall growth with strong results across the board and Accenture Analytics, Accenture Mobility and Accenture Interactive.","Operations and application services were also highlights in the quarter. Operations generated double digit growth in both the BPO and infrastructure services and we saw strong growth in application services as well.","Looking at the operating groups, we were very pleased with the 15% growth in communications, media and technology. Overall growth was broad based driven by strong double-digit growth in both consulting and outsourcing across all three industries and in North America and the growth markets. Digital related services, cost optimization and continued execution of large transformational projects were the primary drivers of growth.","In H&PS the 13% growth in the quarter was led by very significant growth in our health business, particularly in the public sector driven by our work with federal health clients, state health exchanges and Medicaid related work. Digital related services were also a strong growth driver across H&PS.","Financial services grew 11% led by banking and capital markets globally with particularly strong growth in Europe. Clients continue to be focused on three main areas; risk and regulatory, cost optimization and digital related services, especially in distribution and marketing. Products, our largest operating group, delivered 10% growth driven by double digit growth in both consulting and outsourcing and another quarter of broad based strength across all industries and geographic areas. digital and cost optimization were significant areas of focus for clients in this operating group as well and application services was also a driver with strength in ERP related work.","Resources grew 2%, up from last quarter, as we continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in positioning for sustained positive growth this year. Ongoing challenges in natural resources continued to offset growth in the other three industries, most notably, chemicals, where we had significant double digit growth. Cost optimization is a dominant theme across resources, which has resulted in strong demand for operations and application services.","Moving down to income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.2% compared with 33.3% for the same period last year, down 110 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.5% of net revenues compared with 12.6% of net revenues for the first quarter last year, down 110 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.6% of net revenues compared with 6.1% of net revenues for the first quarter last year, down 50 basis points. Operating income was $1.2 billion for the first quarter, reflecting a 15% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter one of last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, equal to the effective tax rate for the same period last year. Net income was $892 million for the first quarter compared with $812 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.29 compared with EPS of $1.15 in the first quarter last year. This reflects a 12% year-over-year increase.","Turning to DSOs, or days services outstanding, continue to be insulating. There were 37 days, up from 36 days last quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $873 million, net of property and equipment additions of $52 million. Cash flows in the quarter were positively impacted by shift in the timing of a portion of compensation payments, which were paid in quarter one in prior years and beginning this year will be paid in quarter two with no impact to full year cash flow.","Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at November 30th was 4.5 billion compared with 4.9 billion at August 31st and reflects our share repurchases this quarter in addition to higher dividends we paid in November.","Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 319,000 people and we now have approximately 218,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter one our utilization was 91% we\u2019ve updated the methodology we used to calculate our utilization metric to include all billable headcount. This change increased utilization by about 3% and accounts for the increase from quarter four. Attrition which excludes in voluntary terminations was 13% compared to 15% quarter four and 11% in the same period last year. Lastly we now expected at least 19,000 will join our company in fiscal \u201915. ","Turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter we\u2019ve repurchased redeemed approximately 8.4 million shares for $670 million at an average price of $80.25 per share. At November 30 we had approximately $4.1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. ","Also in November we paid a semi-annual cash dividend of [$1.02] [ph] per share for a total $679 million. This represented a $0.09 or 10%, over the dividend we paid in May. ","So in summary, we\u2019re off to an excellent start in fiscal 2015. That said, the environment continues to be challenging which requires that we manage our business with rigor and discipline each and every day which we are committed to doing.","Now let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme ","Thank you David. At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October we provided an update on our growth strategy including the investments we\u2019ve made and the actions we\u2019ve taken to make [indiscernible] Accenture even more relevant, differentiated and competitive in the marketplace and our excellent result this quarter demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy across the different dimensions of our business and that we are growing significantly relative to market. ","Let me share with you a few example of the outcome based work we are doing for our clients, as well as some key investments and initiatives we have announced recently. ","In Accenture Strategy our unique approached combining business strategy and technology strategy is resonating well we see with executive. A great example is the work we are doing with one of the largest bank in Canada where our industry expels our designing and implementing a global technology strategy to drive 20% ongoing annual savings by optimizing the bank's portfolio of applications. ","In Accenture Digital we continue to invest to expand our capabilities in Accenture Interactive to better serve Chief Marketing Officers. Earlier this month we announced acquisition of Reactive Media one of the Australia\u2019s leading independent digital agencies. Reactive specializes in creating differentiated customer experiences through digital channels such as apps, and e-commerce websites. And we are benefiting from the investment we have made to enhance our capabilities in Accenture Analytics. We are working with a European auto company to include forecasting, pricing and promotion towards thousands of parts across 18 countries. We are leveraging our [strategy] [ph] in supply chain analytics and the spare part app from our recent i4C acquisition to help our clients drive $65 million in new path revenue. ","In Accenture Technology we just announced a major strategic initiative with Microsoft to drive enterprise cloud adoption. The Accenture hybrid class solution for Microsoft Azure will provide a new wave for our clients to transform to a truly enterprise wide hybrid cloud environment. The unique solution is being co-engineered across Accenture, Microsoft and Avanade our joint venture to bring new capabilities and innovation to our enterprise clients. ","In Application Services we continue to compete to win by providing our clients with the very best technology services at the most competitive cost. ","We recently expanded our relationship with the long standing clients in resources to drive an IT transformation to enable greater business agility. We are managing more than 200 ERP, data and digital applications across a wide range of platforms leveraging the capabilities of our global delivery network in India, The United States, Spain, Brazil and Costa Rica.","And finally in Accenture Operations the capabilities we\u2019ve built were key to a recent win with a global automotive client. We are operating it end to end marketing service across multiple brands and markets by combining our industry expertise with our strategy, digital, analytics and operations capabilities we are helping transformed the company's digital marketing and increase digital sales. ","I am also very pleased that in capital markets we signed our second client for Accenture post trade processing. Our industry business service to manage securities operation for investment banks which we created a year ago with Societe Generale as our first client.","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I am very pleased with the balanced growth we delivered in the first quarter across all three regions. In North America we grew revenues 12% in local currency. Our business in the United States continues to perform extremely well with strong double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. In Europe despite the continued challenging economic environment we grew revenues 9% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in Germany, Italy, France and Norway.","And in our gross markets we delivered revenue growth of 9% in local currency. I am very pleased that Brazil is back, with strong double-digit growth and we continue to perform very well in Japan with another quarter of double-digit growth and I am also pleased with our strong growth in Australia.","So we see very good momentum in our business and have delivered an excellent first quarter on top of a strong second half of fiscal year \u201814. At the same time we are monitoring carefully the macroeconomic environment the significant fold in global oil prices since last June, could boost growth in the global economy but also create a more challenging environment for companies in the energy sector and certainly contributes to greater uncertainty and volatility in the marketplace.","We continue to operate in a fast changing environment driven by so much disruption and in this context we see significant opportunity and demand for Accenture\u2019s highly relevant and differentiated services. ","To capture additional market share and drive sustainable profitable growth we will continue to leverage our strong client relationship, our deep industry expertise, our unique position in the technology ecosystem, our broad global footprint and even more important, the passion of our 319,000 men and women of Accenture.","With that I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year \u201815. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thanks Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter fiscal \u201815 we expect revenues to be in the range of 7.25 billion to 7.50 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal \u201814. For the full fiscal year \u201815 based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal \u201814.","For the full fiscal \u201815 we now expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% in local currency over fiscal \u201814. For the full fiscal year \u201815 we continue to expect new bookings to be in the range of $34 billion to $36 billion. For operating margin we continue to expect fiscal year \u201815 to be 14.4% to 14.6% a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal \u201914 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%.","For earnings per share we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal \u201815 to be in the range of $4.66 to $4.80 or 3% to 6% growth over fiscal \u201814 results. Absent the higher FX headwind which impacts EPS by $0.14 our EPS range would have increased by $0.06 driven by the higher revenue growth range. ","Now turning to cash flow for the full fiscal \u201815 we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of 3.95 billion to 4.25 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately 450 million and free cash flow to be in the range of 3.5 billion to 3.8 billion.","Finally we continue to expect to return at least 3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted share outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning the substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that let\u2019s open it up so that we can take your questions. KC.","KC McClure","Thanks David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Tom would you provide instructions for those in the call please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Tien-Tsin Huang representing JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang","I guess I was surprise to see you increase your revenue growth guidance this early in the fiscal year on characteristic; it\u2019s good obviously but just sounds like faster booking conversion if I heard that correctly. Is that a structural change that could persist here for few quarters? Or is this more of a temporary phenomenon that we should consider?","David Rowland","Certainly the composition of our bookings in the first quarter was an influence of the 10% growth and as I commented Tien-Tsin you and others have heard me reference previously what I refer to as annual contract value. So it\u2019s the portion of our total bookings or the total contract value that converts to revenue in the fiscal year and we were very pleased with that number in the first quarter. And really that\u2019s been a trend that we\u2019ve seen really going even to the back half of last year as our growth went from 7% as you know in the third quarter to 8% in the fourth quarter. ","And you\u2019ve also heard me mention that as important as the larger transformational projects are to us, we also have been focusing our client teams more on thinking about the annual contract value of the work that we sell and deliver to clients. And I think we see some of that reflected in the growth in the first quarter and also in the second half of last year.","Tien-Tsin Huang","And my follow up then just I know that you didn\u2019t update your bookings forecast despite the big FX headwind. So, I know it\u2019s a really wide range. But is that effectively ways in constant currency bookings to try to better tie that to the constant currency revenue comments? Thanks.","David Rowland","It is just mathematically it\u2019s effectively arranged for the reasons you\u2019re pointing out. I mean, on the bookings front, we feel very good about our pipeline. We are only one quarter into the year. We still think that the 34 to 36 range is the right range for us to be focused on. And for that reason we didn\u2019t change it even though the FX did change.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso","I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the impact of oil prices both on the positive side where you think you would see it and also on the negative side within your energy sector? And maybe talk a little bit about what your clients -- you're seeing them react at this point are they reacting already? Thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","This is Pierre I will pick up that one. As we speak and we comment almost as of today, we\u2019ve not yet seen any form of significant impact in our business with what\u2019s happening. I believe that these big organizations in energy, oil and gas are just watching the situation. It has been very volatile this last few weeks and I guess our clients in these companies are waiting a bit to understand whether there is going to be some form of stabilization and when you have some form of stabilization you can stop executing your strategy. But as we speak we're not seeing any different pattern with our clients and I would characterize my dialog as being in a watching mode not panicking.","Edward Caso","Now that the energy vertical I believe is about 6%. Is it long term -- can you give us a sense for what the mix is consulting versus outsourcing? And how quickly if your clients get more nervous it could get dial back?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, if you look at it, I guess, it\u2019s not going to be very different from the mix of Accenture from consulting and outsourcing standpoint. So, indeed, a good portion of the business going to be around outsourcing contract with long term commitment. As you know, we have even some clients where we are doing a business process outsourcing operations a very large and important client where we are doing finance and accounting. So these are kind of portion where which are contracted for long term and which are of course mission critical for the clients.","So to answer your question the level of vulnerability would be more around the short-term consulting project and so forth, which would be a part of this 6%. So I guess that would probably impact something like a portion of 3%, if you will.","Edward Caso","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Brian Essex","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you circle back a little bit more or less [ACV] and tremendous [indiscernible] my math wrong tremendous employee headcount growth in the quarter. When I look at that relative to software bookings although it\u2019s higher conversion rates how much visibility do you have in the headcount and maybe you can help give us a little bit of color in terms of where you\u2019re hiring and the mix of hiring given that revenue per head has been down little bit. What is the visibility that we\u2019ve got aggressive [indiscernible] growth?","David Rowland","First of all, just in terms of visibility and how that influences our supply planning. I mean, first of all, as you know, we are very effective at managing the supply side of our business. It\u2019s a core competency of ours. And we are managing, adjusting and tuning the supply side including hiring daily if not hourly. ","Now in terms of the growth in headcount, certainly and I think the tone of the comments hopefully indicated as much, we feel very good about our business. We exited last year with good momentum, that momentum translated into strong growth in the first quarter. It translated into a lower dollar value of booking but yet a very high quality of bookings with respect to how it will benefit revenue this year. And if you reflect on the guidance that we gave for the second quarter the upper end of that range is 10% in local currency. And so what all of that points to is confidence in our business and that underpins what we\u2019re doing on the headcount front. ","Now as it relates to headcount one of the many but important differentiating characteristics of Accenture is GDN and we continue to invest heavily in GDN including on the talent side. And so if you look at the recruiting that we did in the first quarter as you can see in the numbers its biased towards GDN but yet it\u2019s important to recognize that we\u2019re hiring in just about every geography around the world and we\u2019re hiring meaningful numbers of people in all of our local markets. So I think the headcount just reflects the confidence that we have in our business.","Brian Essex","Okay and just as a follow up, is there any [deal] [ph] in particular that you\u2019re -particularly excited about? I know at the Analyst Day appears pretty confident about BPO in Europe. Is that actually materializing now and you\u2019re seeing greater traction in that deal particularly with regards to BPO and maybe impact longer term upside downside to your full year forecast?","Pierre Nanterme","Of course on the country I am most excited [indiscernible] no doubt. Where we add a quarter I would characterize that\u2019s fabulous based on fact nothing to do with my nationality of course. But I am pleased with what\u2019s happening. I am extremely pleased with the sustainability of our performance in the United States. It is very important it is the largest market of Accenture and it is I would say the global market where things are happening in our industry. ","This is where things happening from a digital standpoint, from an innovation standpoint as well from a disruption standpoint from an energy standpoint we can comment all of this and it\u2019s for us all goodness that we are doing so well in the U.S. We are gaining market share and it\u2019s been the case now for with this last four years. So it's not the story of a quarter. ","I am extraordinarily impressed with what we are doing in Europe and I am mentioning impressed because we all know that the economic contact and conditions in Europe are very different from the U.S and driving 9% local currency growth in the European market is very significant including growths in our most mature market. I mean growing in Italy double digital digit, growing in France double digit, growing in Germany double digit it\u2019s a big achievement for Accenture and why we\u2019ve been able to do that to get back to your first question, indeed we have these last couple of years we have excellent traction in outsourcing, application outsourcings and we\u2019ve been able to evolve our portfolio of business to BPO and we have some very landmark deals specially in electronic and hi-tech in business process outsourcing but as well as in banking in Italy just to get two illustration explaining France and Italy and the good news I would say this quarter from a European standpoint is consulting is back which is demonstrating that our clients are starting to re-invest in consulting first in digital related services couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our digital business at Accenture. I would characterize on flyer not being emphatic but as well we see good opportunities again back in big ERP.","Operator","We have a question from Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Lisa Ellis","Can you describe in a little bit more detail I know you watch the book to bill number pretty closely. And now two quarters in a row like the consulting to book to bill is spend less than one and I know what your saying is that\u2019s because the mix of those services are such they\u2019re rolling through quicker. Can you just talk about that, is a conversion time or what exactly is going on under the covers their?","David Rowland","Yes I guess just couple of thoughts. First of all as you know Lisa watching our business the bookings as we\u2019ve always said probably said a thousand times the bookings can be lumpy across the quarters. And I think some of what you see this quarter is lumpiness I mean sometimes it\u2019s really an insignificant difference as to whether or not we close let\u2019s say one or two larger deals the last week of the quarter or the first week of the next quarter. It\u2019s really just a timing issue. I will say by the way if I\u2019ll just take this opportunity to point out that in the quarter we did have six clients with bookings over a $100 million and that\u2019s a healthy number by any one standard but for us it\u2019s a little bit lighter than what we\u2019ve seen in some quarters in the last four to six. And so that was an influencing factor in the first quarter. Nonetheless we very pleased with the quality of what we sold as I said. ","And so we don\u2019t read anything through in terms of the fact that we had several very strong quarters, last quarter was a little bit lighter, this quarter as I characterized it, but yet if you look at our guidance range for the full year and if you just do the math then that tells you kind of what we\u2019re thinking about in terms of kind of on average what our bookings would be for the next three quarters and of course that would put the bookings right back in the sweet spot of our book to bills.","So if I go to where you stared we still focus very much on the book to bill metric of 1.0 to 1.1 for consulting and at least 1.2 for outsourcing but that doesn\u2019t mean that hit it every quarter and when we don\u2019t hit it every quarter we\u2019re not worried about that we\u2019re really focused on how we perform against those metrics really over kind of a multi quarter period. And I think for this fiscal year you\u2019ll see it play out in a way that the book to bills will look normal to you if you will.","Lisa Ellis","And then just one real quick follow up. I know you always talk about don\u2019t focus on the operating margin number and not the distinction between gross margin versus net, because expenses kind of fall in a different bucket. But I an environment we\u2019ve been increasing mix of consulting, I was sort of surprise to see that the gross margins continued to decline I would have I guess that would be the other way around. Can you just talk a little bit about that dynamic?","David Rowland","Absolutely and I would have been disappointed Lisa had you not asked that question. Hey it\u2019s a good question and at the risk of being redundant I am just going to anchor back to some of the things [indiscernible], but I\u2019ll give you some nuggets for the quarter as well. And so just for the benefit of everyone who's listening, we do really focus on operating margin. And at the end of the day what we really focus on at the highest level is driving a business that are payroll cost and are non-payroll cost evolve in a way that supports margin expansion.","And so if you look at payroll as an example we\u2019re much more concerned about the overall efficiency of the payroll, then we are the portion of the payroll that is reflected in sales and marketing versus cost of services at any particular point in time. I think maybe if I stay at the level that is appropriate, let me just point out a couple of things on gross margins.","The first thing is and this is little bit of the dynamics that you have to understand is that our contract profitability actually was up year-over-year. So this is not an issue but this is not in gross margin driven by contract profitability pressures in the quarter. So what is it then? Well we have a lot of other cost that go into gross margin. We have recruiting cost; we\u2019re hiring a lot of people in the first quarter. We have training costs, when we hire people we train them. We have types of our investments show up in gross margin, I characterized that what we\u2019re focused on is investing in our business while at the same time growing revenue and expanding profit.","So you have other things like other components of payroll variable comp as you know shows up in gross margin. So there are many factors that show up in gross margin to the root of your question it was not contract profitability, contract profitability increased and operating margin increased overall at 20 basis points and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all about.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I guess a couple of questions on revenues. One is with regards to the contribution of acquisitions to this quarter. Of you could talk about that and then not a related question but also revenue question? How do you get the FX headwind of 5%? And maybe I mean I am getting 3.5%, you guys are doing a pretty good job of telling us what the revenue mix is. So I am kind of wondering if maybe use FX as a part of being conservative overall given the uncertainty of rates.","David Rowland","Yes, so let me just start off with on the inorganic piece. I think last quarter I said that it would be around 1%, 1.5% for the year. And quarter one was clearly in that zone, which means the simple extrapolation is that most of our growth was organically driven. And so when you look at the 10% in the context of what I just said, it\u2019s another indicator of the health of our business. ","Ashwin on the FX we go through a process and it\u2019s been a process we\u2019ve done for as long as I can remember which is probably back to the first quarter of being a public company. We do a process where we look at the rates on a daily basis in the two to three weeks leading up to the earnings call and we look at what the trends are in the most recent two to three weeks. I mean there is -- it\u2019s really more -- it\u2019s objectively driven. We don\u2019t try to speculate on what rates might do going forward.","And if you look at the objective analytics based on the distribution of our currencies and we have the rates have trended then you come up with a solid 5%. And I just say it\u2019s a solid 5%.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. And maybe we can take that one up offline. But the second question I have is with regards to margins and you just went through on the previous question pretty good description of the various cost and such. But the margin improvement of 20 basis points I am kind of curious as you look at it and you look at your forward bookings what\u2019s in your pipeline in other words, one of the factors that have got to be helping you on a forward looking basis. Is that your mix has gone from 46% consulting to 50% consulting? But also you\u2019ve hiring so many people in regards to GDN which should presumably be able to help margins. My perception has also been based on my checks that the strong digital and mobility type work that comes through is higher margin. So I am really curious what\u2019s been on the operating margin basis, what\u2019s the offset that gets you to 20 basis points? I\u2019d expect you guys do 30, 40 basis points.","David Rowland","So that was a statement or question? ","Ashwin Shirvaikar","The last five words were a question.","David Rowland","Again, we are managing our business to drive sustainable margin expansion in the 20 to 30 basis point range. And as part of that, critically important as we\u2019re committed to investing in our business which includes investing in our people, we balance those things in the context of our results to deliver as predictably as we can in that 10 to 30 basis point range and we landed at 20. And so that\u2019s it.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay, any color on this start-up cost turn some of the BPO things you signed? I mean any other color?","David Rowland","Not really and nothing to add beyond what I\u2019ve said there is.","Operator","Our next question is from Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Moshe Katri","Thanks. Just not to be the [horse] [ph] here going by the discussion on margins I think [Technical Difficulty] went up by a couple 100 basis points, I think to 300 basis point. Again how does it reconcile with the drop in gross margins. I mean it\u2019s a pretty big expansion in the [indiscernible] I didn\u2019t say attrition I meant to say utilization rates, I think went up to 91%. How does it reconcile with the gross margin drops during the quarter? Thanks.","David Rowland","Thanks for the question and I guess maybe opportunity to reiterate something that I\u2019ve said in the script because it\u2019s an important point to understand. So you are aware that starting a few quarters ago that we with our headcount reporting we now have billable headcount as a line item. We have aligned the billable headcount with the utilization metric more directly. And as a result of that, so what does that mean? That means that we\u2019ve now included people in the utilization metric that are typically people who are working on outsourcing contracts that previously were excluded. So they\u2019re now included in that metric which the change increased our utilization to 91%, 3%. Absent that change, the utilization effectively did not change at all. So the utilization is really just -- we redefined how we report utilization to include all billable headcount which I think is going to be easier for certainly for us and for the outside world going forward.","Moshe Katri","That does make sense. And then just briefly we\u2019ve [Technical Difficulty] pointed to a weaker sentiment and over extended budget cycle as those financial services vertical. Does that sign any -- I mean is it something that you guys are doing out there? Can you give us any color on that?","KC McClure","Moshe, this is KC, I'm sorry, we\u2019re having a tough time hearing you, you\u2019re breaking up a little bit.","David Rowland","Which vertical were you asking about?","Moshe Katri","FS, financial services.","KC McClure","Did you just want a little color on financial services?","Moshe Katri","What I said was that a survey point to weaker spending sentiment and over extended budget cycle in financial services vertical and I am asking if you guys can comment on that? Are you seeing any of this in your business? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","I mean on financial services, double digit growth is I mean this quarter when we look at the growth this year the growth was quite well balanced. So when I look at this I would say things are going well. We have growth in outsourcing, good growth in consulting back again in financial services. And going pretty well across the board so I do not see anything specific in financial services and this last two quarters we\u2019ve been driving good growth with that vertical and we feel good about it including and I am taking the opportunity as I mentioned in my presentation we have our second client joining Accenture post trade servicing the unique capability in BPO where we are providing post trade services [indiscernible] we have our second client. So I think our new services are getting even more traction.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Good morning so I have just a couple quick ones. Your business now is 20% or more in digital and cloud based solutions and I am just wondering more specifically when we think about the types of revenue that you're recognizing within that, is that really what\u2019s driving your visibility and improved trajectory and then ultimately kind of the margin trajectory are we seeing at the operating line or is there something else and it also seems as though that business is now bigger than your legacy ERP and I am wondering if that\u2019s giving you better visibility to the future. Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","When you look at our drivers for growth and related to the presentation we made in the IA day, we had two plus one, clearly digital related services are a business where we invested significantly as you saw seven years and when we are getting a very significant return. As we mentioned our digital related services are in the range of the $5 billion and indeed are growing in excess of 20%. ","So indeed it is an engine for growth. This is what that was supposed to be. We invested a lot organic or through some very targeted acquisitions as you remember the [indiscernible] equity, the avVenta, more recently i4C or this acquisition we made in Australia with a Reactive Media and we will continue to do so. And indeed it is for us very important investment source of growth because this is where the market is turning to. ","I mean the second big engine for growth is what we characterize as everything related to rationalization of the operation for our clients which is resonating very well with our business in operations. And no surprise our business in operations, this business is growing double digit growth, so in access of 10%. And here you have two clear engines for growth, very sustainable, very strong and again when I look at operations it\u2019s not by surprise we invested heavily in some acquisition and if you take procurement [every about] [ph] few years ago and more recently procurement. ","And the third one when I said two plus one because this one is more lumpy, as David would say is around the large scale transformation programs. So every year we have a number of large scale transactions because this is the specialty of Accenture and we benefit from these three engines for growth. So we will continue moving forward to invest both in digital and both in our rationalization capability to do well especially around the applications how we see growing double digit and operations growing double digit and we will continue having our large scale transformation programs.","Dan Perlin","The other thing I just wanted to touch on. You mentioned that the ERP is kind of an opportunity you\u2019re coming back and I wanted to make sure there was a clarification point. Are you talking about your partnerships now with cloud based ERP implementation or just legacy ERP and then if it\u2019s legacy, can you just talk a little about what\u2019s the nature behind that now? Would you think that would be shifting away from that? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","Both. We are extremely pleased with the traction we are getting and if I had to mention one, we are already leading on HANA implementation with SAP on a global basis. So the new ERP HANA based solution cloud enable and we already the number one in implementing the solution to marketplace that we see as well. The more classic legacy ERP to support the global expansion on very large clients and I have in mind two or three recent situations where we\u2019ve been winning some very significant ERP in finance and accounting, in supply chain to support the transformation and the expansion of leading global groups. And for these groups you need the more classic I would say backbone that might around [the record] [ph], that might be around SAP or that might be around Microsoft. ","And we see a few coming yet back again and as we speak at least I have three illustration in mind coming in Europe for very large global group and very large ERP. So we\u2019re pleased with that business. Of course the digital related services are high per growth, are driving the growth and this is where we are investing. But we are pleased with where we are with our ERP business which has been stabilizing this last quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Jason Kupferberg ","So maybe just two finally put the gross margin questions to back. I think all that extra color around the different buckets of cost on the COGS lines was very helpful. But given that there are these other buckets of cost outside of underlying core contract profitability, are you basically telling us that the trend of year-over-year decline in gross margin will probably continue because of pressure from those other areas? Or do you think that we\u2019re closer to sort of a stabilization point in terms of year-over-year trend in gross margin. And the reason I ask and again I appreciate the focus on operating margin but just so that we get the models kind of tuned right and may mitigate the need for other questions like this in the future.","David Rowland","I think and by the way I appreciate these questions because I know what you\u2019re trying to do in connecting the dots. I mean what I would say is that I am not going to comment specifically on gross margin guidance, because we really got to operating margin. But what I\u2019ll say is that if you look at contract profitability as a factor, we are forever focused on improving our contract profitability over time. And that will be an objective for the remainder of this year just as it hits an objective every year.","And so we\u2019re always focused in challenging our teams to improve the profitability of the portfolio of contracts that we\u2019re doing in our business. The other thing when you said would be a headwind or would be a drag, again some of these things are investments and we wouldn\u2019t view that as a negative thing if it\u2019s in the context of expanding operating margin. And so I am not suggesting that we just completely ignore, we do look at the functional areas within our GAAP P&L but what we\u2019re really managing to as operating margin and if we\u2019re expanding contract profitability, let\u2019s say investing more or rewarding our people more or whatever the element maybe in gross margin and at the same time expanding operating margin. That\u2019s all by design.","We\u2019re not solving to expand gross margin, we\u2019re solving to expand operating margin and fundamentally underneath that we are focused on improving the profitability of the work we do with clients and then we\u2019re also solving for investing more in our business and in the context of those things driving operating margin expansion. If we do that, that\u2019s what\u2019s most important.","Jason Kupferberg ","And just a shift to the topline which was obviously really strong here and you did talk about the increased visibility leading to the uptick and the guidance range. So I know in the past you had given some actual percentages in terms of the percent of your revenue target for the full year that\u2019s actually under contract. And I was just wondering if you could give us where you stand on that percentage now versus maybe where you were a year ago.","David Rowland","We really got away from giving that number because it was one that we found was creating more confusion than it was helpful. So I won\u2019t give a specific number but I\u2019ll just characterize that we have a very good position with our contracted revenues. And they are very well positioned relative to the revenue guidance range; let me put it that way. And again as we have been focused more and more on our annual contract value that certainly gives us better contracted revenue visibility in the fiscal year.","KC McClure","Tom we have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","So in the quarter the 10% constant currency revenue growth was a few points above the guided range. And for the past few years we\u2019ve didn\u2019t see Accenture really beat its current quarter range much. So I guess what would you point to that cause the upside surprise in the given quarter?","David Rowland","Look, truthfully it was broad based; I think that it wasn\u2019t one thing. It was really better performance across our five operating groups than what we had assumed even what we had assumed when we provided the guidance as we were working to be at the upper end. And I think as Pierre said, digital the level of growth in digital is just extremely strong. We had assumed it would be strong, it\u2019s very strong digital, operations, app services, those are all drivers and we saw elements of that across all five operating groups. And really you could say across all three areas. So it was broad based. ","Pierre Nanterme","But you know it's one close that for me is standing apart and which is probably over achieving and even taking out by surprise and this is good news is all about digital related services. This is a way we decided to ride, there is a strong trend we want to take leader position, we like Accenture Digital, we are now evaluated by the Governor at the largest and the number one organization providing digital related services. And in excess of 20% growth, it has probably taken us a little bit by surprise and this is a kind of surprise we love.","Bryan Keane","And then just on the pricing front. I think it was three quarters ago you kind of put a scare through the market talking about pricing pressure and application work. It doesn\u2019t really seem to be -- I can\u2019t see in the numbers. So can you just comment that on that and then just lastly as a bonus question since some last resources, so what are you expecting? Do you expect that vertical to get weaker in your guidance or do you expect it to maintain its growth? Thanks so much.","David Rowland","Let me just work backwards, on resources our Chief Executive of the Resources is still very much focused on driving growth for the year and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress and we should acknowledge that team\u2019s efforts and what they\u2019ve done to position the business going forward. So that continues to be our goal. But yet we have a close eye, very close eye, on energy obviously. What was the other question?","On pricing, pricing is stable. We\u2019ve actually been pleased with -- I think I can say we\u2019ve been pleased with the pricing trends in the recent few quarters. I am just going to characterize it as stable with some strength in certain areas of our business. But overall, stable. But obviously in an environment that continues to be very-very competitive.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you. Thanks a lot for the good question and thanks David as well. So, thanks again for joining us on today\u2019s call. With the first quarter behind us and given the very strong momentum in our business, I feel confident about our ability to deliver our revised business outlook. Moving forward, we will continue to look at opportunities to invest in differentiated capabilities, to position Accenture for growth and success in the marketplace and continue gaining market share. I want to wish everyone on today\u2019s call a very happy holiday season and best wishes for the New Year. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions please feel free to call KC. All the best. Happy holiday.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay starting at 10.30 AM this morning and running through March 26 at midnight.

Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Steve, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014 earnings announcement. As Steve just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2015.

We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased with our results for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Starting with the quarter our strong revenue growth of 8% was broad-based across the different dimensions of our business and coming on top of our strong growth in Q3, enabled us to deliver an excellent second half of the year.","For the full year we increased market share, generated record revenues and new bookings, grew EPS faster than revenues and generated strong cash flow, all while continuing to invest to further differentiate our business and delivering significant value for our clients and shareholders.","David will provide more detail in a moment but here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered record new bookings of $35.9 billion. We grew revenues 5% for the year; we delivered earning per share of $4.52, a 7% increase. We expanded operating margin 10 basis points to 13.3% -- 14.3%. We generated free cash flow of $3.2 billion and we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the year with a cash balance of $4.9 billion. We returned $3.8 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and we just announced our semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share, which is a 10% increase over our prior dividend.","Our performance in fiscal \u201914 clearly demonstrate that we are executing very well against our strategy and given our strong growth in the second half of the year I am pleased with the momentum in our business as we enter the new fiscal year.","Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you.","David P. Rowland","Thank you, Pierre and thanks all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter four as they continue to reflect positive momentum in many areas of our business and clearly illustrate the relevance of our growth strategy and the yield we are getting from important investments we have made over the past two years.","Before I get into the details I\u2019d to highlight three aspects of our quarter four results which are particularly noteworthy. First, the most distinguishing aspect of our results was clearly the strong top line growth of 8%, exceeding our expectations and landing above the top end of our guided range for the quarter. Our revenue growth is underpinned by continued improved growth rates in many areas of our business, building further on the improvements we delivered in quarter three. And overall net revenue growth was at the highest levels we have seen since quarter four of fiscal \u201912.","Second, our profitability in quarter four came in as expected, yielding 10 basis points of expansion for the full year. It\u2019s noteworthy that we achieved this result while taking actions to continue to align our headcount and labor cost in certain parts of our business. We are pleased with the progress we are making to better position our profitability going forward.","Third, we generated strong cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, putting us at the upper end of our previously guided annual range and of course we continue to return significant cash to shareholders while at the same time investing in our business. So we are very pleased with the quarter and in fact more broadly with our strong performance in the second half of the year.","With that said let\u2019s now turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were $8.3 billion resulting in $35.9 billion in new bookings for the full fiscal year which was at the very top of the business outlook range provided in June and represents an all-time high in annual new bookings.","Consulting bookings were $3.9 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $4.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Taking a closer look at our new bookings there are several additional points worth nothing. For the fourth consecutive quarter consulting bookings landed within our target book-to-bill range and reflected good demand for systems integration and management consulting. For the year consulting bookings of $17.1 billion were the highest ever with management consulting and systems integration both achieving a strong 1.1 book to bill and technology consulting also delivering a solid year at 1.0.","We continue to be pleased with another quarter of solid outsourcing bookings. Results in technology outsourcing reflected an uptick compared to quarter three and BPO bookings continue to reflect healthy demand. Also there were a number of record highs with our new bookings results in fiscal \u201914, in both consulting and outsourcing and in outsourcing, particularly in BPO which had a 1.7 book to bill, CMT Financial Services and H&PS set record highs as well. And finally we continued our track record of winning large transformational projects with nine clients with bookings in access of $100 million bringing the total for the year to 39.","Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency, reflecting a positive 1.5% FX impact, consistent with the assumption provided in June. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4 billion, up 6% in USD and 4% in local currency.","Outsourcing revenues were $3.8 billion, up 15% in USD and 13% in local currency. Looking broadly at the major drivers of growth in the quarter outsourcing was a highlight coming in even stronger than we expected driven by strength in both BPO and technology outsourcing. In addition, we continued to be pleased with the strong contribution of our digital-related services to our overall growth. ","Turning to the operating groups, the momentum in communications, media and technology continued with 12% growth, the highest in ten quarters. Broad-based growth was driven by three notable areas, E&HT, outsourcing in the Americas. In Products, the 12% growth was broad-based across all industries and in both consulting and outsourcing. H&PS grew 9% in the quarter, coming from both public service and more notably Health, where we continue to deliver double digit growth in consulting and outsourcing. ","Financial Services grew 8%, up from last quarter led by very strong growth in outsourcing and within our banking and capital markets industries. Resources was flat in quarter four and while we still have some work to do we were encouraged by progress in several areas. We had growth in three of the four industries while natural resources continues to be challenged globally.","Moving down the income statement gross margin for the quarter was 31.7% compared with 33.2% for the same period last year, down a 150 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.8% of net revenue compared with 12.6% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year, down 80 basis points. G&A expense was 6.1% of net revenues, compared with 6.7% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year, down 60 basis points. ","Operating income was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter reflecting a 13.9% operating margin equal to the operating margin for the same period last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared with 24.6% for the fourth quarter last year. The higher rate in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower benefits related to the final determinations of prior year tax -- of prior year liabilities and a higher level of reserve additions. ","Net income was $760 million for the fourth quarter compared with $727 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were a $1.08 compared with EPS of a $1.01 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 7% year-over-year increase and includes a negative impact of $0.09 from a higher tax rate this quarter. Turning to DSOs our days services outstanding continue to be industry leading. They were 36 days, up from 35 days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.6 billion, net of property and equipment additions of a $101 million.","Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at August 31 was $4.9 billion compared with $5.6 billion at August 31 last year. The current level reflects the cash returned to shareholders through repurchase and dividends as well as the acquisitions we made in fiscal \u201914. ","Moving to some other key operational metrics we hired approximately 80,000 people in fiscal \u201914 ending the year with a global headcount of more than 305,000 and we now have over 205,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter four our utilization was 88% consistent with last quarter, Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations was 15%, up from both quarter three and the same period last year. ","Now turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders; in the fourth quarter we repurchased or redeemed approximately 8.2 million shares for $658 million at an average price of $80.36 per share. For the full year we repurchased or redeemed 32.6 million for $2.6 billion at an average price of $78.52 per share. Finally, as Pierre mentioned our Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of a $1.02 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 17 and represents a $0.09 per share or 10% increase over the previous semi-annual dividend we declared in March. ","So before I turn things back over to Pierre let me just briefly reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our business outlook. Again new bookings were $35.9 billion at the top end of our guided range. Net revenues grew 5% in local currency for the full year, at the top end of our most recent guided range and in the upper end of the range provided at the beginning of the year.","As a reminder fiscal '13 we had two unusual items that impacted certain metrics. The following year-over-year comparisons exclude those impacts and use fiscal '13 adjusted results. Operating margin was 14.3%, within the guided range we provided at the beginning of the year and spot on the guidance we provided most recently. EPS was $4.52 at the midpoint of our most recent guided range and at the upper end of the range provided at the beginning of the year and reflects 7% growth over fiscal '13, consistent with our objective of growing EPS faster than revenue.","Free cash flow was a rounded $3.2 billion, at the upper end of our previously guided range and at the low end of the range provided at the beginning of the year. And then finally we've returned approximately $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, more than $100 million above our initial objective through $2.6 billion in repurchases and $1.3 billion in dividend payments. In addition we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 3%. ","So, reflecting on the business outlook we provided at the beginning of the year we successfully managed our business and delivered on each metric with several of the metrics landing in the upper end of the range. We're pleased with the overall improvement we saw in our results in the second half of the year, especially the acceleration in growth we signaled one year ago. Now let me turn it back over to Pierre. ","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. Our performance for the fiscal year, especially the strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter and second half of the year demonstrates that we are executing the right growth strategy. We are providing relevant and highly differentiated services that are clearly resonating with the needs of our clients. And we are gaining market share in an environment that continues to be very demanding and highly competitive. In fiscal year '14 we made significant investments in our business, including $740 million in acquisition and we aligned our organization to be even more relevant, differentiated and competitive in the marketplace.","We've created Accenture Strategy, a unique capability and the first in the market to bring together business strategy and technology strategy equally and at scale. We created Accenture Digital by combining our market leading capabilities in Accenture Interactive, Accenture Analytics and Accenture Mobility. ","We now have more than 28,000 professionals working in Accenture Digital, making it the world's largest end-to-end digital capability. We formed Accenture operations by bringing together our market leading business process capabilities with our infrastructure and cloud services, to offer our clients an even more compelling value proposition, running key operations as a service and at scale. In Accenture Technology we further enhanced our global delivery network, recruiting significant talent and investing to build intelligent tools to increase efficiency and productivity.","We continued to harness innovation through our technology labs and to play a leading role in the technology ecosystem. And we infused even more talent into our five operating groups which together serve clients in more than 40 industries, further strengthening our management and technology consulting capabilities. Our people in the operating groups orchestrate and bring together the very best of Accenture across the entire organization to serve our clients, helping us to continue to build long and enduring relationships with the world's leading companies. ","These investments have positioned us very well to capture new growth opportunities as our clients and the industries in which they operate continue to be transformed and reinvented everyday. In this fast changing environment we see the market becoming more and more polarized around two major things; Digitization to create competitive advantage and drive new sources of value, and rationalization to create productivity and efficiency gains. ","At the same time we continue to see demand for large scale transformation programs which has always been Accenture's sweet spot. Let me bring this to light with a few examples that demonstrate our unique position in the marketplace and the value we deliver to our clients. Today all of our clients are facing the imperative to transform their businesses to compete in the digital world and we are partnering with them on this journey. ","A great example is our work with a global media and entertaining company, where we are leveraging the full range of Accenture\u2019s capabilities, especially in mobility, [supervision] and analytics to fundamentally transform the customer experience, by implementing a broad set of digital tools. The centerpiece of this technology is a wearable device that allows customers to access their hotel room and pay for goods and services. Through our work we are helping our clients engage millions of customers each year with a truly integrated and personalized experience. ","At the same time our clients are looking to drive more efficiency and to increase productivity in their operations. At a leading commodity trading and mining company we are providing finance and accounting and procurement services to help improve business operations. We are leveraging our end-to-end sourcing, procurement and analytics capabilities, together with the full power of the global delivery network to deliver over $500 million in bottom line savings, while also providing flexibility for future growth. ","The acquisition we made last year of Procurian, combined with our own sourcing and procurement capabilities make Accenture the clear market leader in procurement BPO and has been instrumental in positioning us for many recent wins in the market. Finally our clients continue to focus on large scale transformation programs. With our extensive industry expertise and broad global footprint as well as our skills in strategy, digital, technology and operations we have built an end-to-end capability that is second to none and as demonstrated by our strong new bookings for the year including 39 quarterly bookings over $100 million Accenture remains the partner of choice for our clients. ","A key example is our work in Texas, where we are leading the state\u2019s effort to build a more efficient and effective Medicaid program. We are leveraging our healthcare expertise as well as our long track record of delivering claims processing systems to support 3.6 million Texas Medicaid participants and 45,000 healthcare providers while processing more than 12.5 million claims each month. ","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business we are very pleased with the strong revenue growth we\u2019re seeing in many of the largest countries in which we operate. Taken together these countries represent a very significant part of Accenture business. Let me start with the United States, our largest single market where I'm particularly pleased with our 10% revenue growth for the fourth quarter and 8% revenue growth for the full year. I am even more pleased with our sustained performance in the U.S. over the last past four years, where we have consistently delivered high single digit or double digit revenue growth, clearly gaining market share in the largest economy in the world. ","In Europe, despite an economic environment that continues to be difficult we are performing very well in many of our largest countries, including France, Italy, Germany and United Kingdom. And in Asia Pacific our growth in Japan has just been outstanding. Japan delivered very strong double digit growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year. ","So we ended fiscal year \u201914 strong and we have clearly benefited from the investments we have made to build and launch highly differentiated capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, to recruit and develop new talent with highly specialized skills, including hiring more than 80,000 people and to further strengthen Accenture\u2019s marketplace positioning and our brand which is among the top 50 brands in the world. ","At the end of the day the real measure of our success and relevance comes from our clients and for me, increasing the number of diamond clients, our largest client relationships is key. I'm delighted that we added 28 new diamond clients during the fiscal year which brings us to a net total of 141 diamond clients, an all-time high. And of course we continue to apply rigor and discipline in everything we do at Accenture to increase our efficiency and enhance our competitiveness so that we can continue to achieve our ultimate goal of delivering sustainable profitable growth over the long term.","With that I will turn the call over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year \u201915. David, over to you.","David P. Rowland"," ","Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal \u201815, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.55 billion to $7.80 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal \u201814. For the full fiscal year \u201915 based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 2% compared to fiscal \u201814. For the full fiscal \u201915 we expect our net revenue to be in the range of 4% to 7% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year \u201815 we are targeting new bookings to be in the range of $34 billion to 36 billion. We expect bookings to be a little lighter in the first quarter and build throughout the year. For operating margin we expect fiscal year \u201815 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal \u201814 results. ","We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal \u201915 to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.88 or 5% to 8% growth over fiscal \u201914 results.","Now turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal \u201915 we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.25 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $450 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion.","Finally we expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders.","With that let's open it up so we can take your questions. KC?","KC McClure","Thanks David. I would ask that you each stick to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Steve, would you provide instructions for those on the call please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Question one will come from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities","Hi, guys, good morning. Just want to ask you about the acceleration in revenue growth. I think last quarter it was 7% in constant currency, this quarter 8% in constant currency in revenue growth. But you are guiding to 4% to 7% which is a little bit of modest downtick from the 8%. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the outlook compared to where we have been here in the last two quarters?","David P. Rowland","Yeah, I think it\u2019s important to look at -- maybe just to step back -- by the way hello, Bryan thanks for the question, by the way. I think it\u2019s important to maybe look at that in a broader context and reflect from where we have been and where we are going, let\u2019s say over a three year period. So two years ago in fiscal \u201913 we had growth at about 4%. This year, the year we just completed we had growth at 5% and while the 4% to 7% reflects what we think is a full range of reasonable outcomes, as I have always said clearly, we are working hard to be as high in that range as we possibly can. ","So if you take the upper half of the range and assuming that the market conditions and our own efforts allow us to land in that space then you start to see the progression of our building business momentum from \u201913 to \u201914 to \u201915 if we can deliver in the upper -- into that range which is 5.5% to 7%. And while 4% to 7% is our range it reflects what we think are possible outcomes depending on what happens with market growth. Everything that we do every day is to drive profitable growth and to work to be as high in the range as we can. ","So you are right but if we deliver, if we execute at the upper end of the -- at the upper half of the range then that is indicative of the momentum that I think you got from Pierre\u2019s comments and from my comments.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay and just maybe a break out between consulting and outsourcing in that outlook. And then just want to ask on the bookings. They\u2019re essentially kind of flattish, just wanted to -- flattish to slightly down, I think on the guidance. I just want to get a sense of how you guys see the market going forward? Thanks so much and congrats.","David P. Rowland","Thank you, Bryan. On the bookings, Bryan we follow the -- really this is the approach we've taken, really since we've been a public company, where we peg our bookings range to our revenue range at our book-to-bill target and it's very simply that math. And we're much more focused on year in and year out delivering against our book-to-bill objective in the year then we are on the year-over-year growth in new bookings because bookings can be lumpy, not only quarter-to-quarter but they can be lumpy year-to-year.","And as we planned it out we just had an exceptional year in fiscal '14 with roughly $36 billion in bookings. And if we land in the $34 billion to $36 billion range as we're guiding to, that would imply that we will be within our book-to-bill targets that supports our revenue ambition for the year and that's a result which we would feel good about based on the book-to-bill objective. So that's the logic there.","On the revenue growth, by type of work, outsourcing we're thinking in our guidance in the high single digit to low double digit range. And in consulting, probably relatively consistent with this year, could be a click lower but also be a click higher, so in that kind of general range. ","Operator","David Grossman, Stifel Financial. ","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus & Company","Hi, thank you. I wonder if you could just go back, David to some of the commentary early in the year, I guess given on the call about the margin pressure resulting from the need to remix some of the labor content and while we recognize that's clearly an ongoing process, can you help us better understand when you would expect to reach a more favorable balance at least based on where you are right now?","David P. Rowland","Yeah, we -- as you would expect we took -- we began taking actions on that, really as we transitioned into the second half of the year in both quarter three and quarter four. David, as you mentioned it is an ongoing process. So we're always focused on tuning the supply side of the equation but within the supply side tuning the payroll efficiency in our P&L.","As I referenced in my comments we did have actions that were noteworthy, which is why I called them out in the fourth quarter, reflecting what we're doing on the supply side and payroll efficiency side in the fourth quarter and that was accounted for, if you will in the results that we delivered. ","What I would say is that while this is an ongoing process we have seen a number of important areas of improvement in our profitability as we progress into the second half of the year. We have seen good progression in payroll efficiency but yet more work to do. We have seen very good progression in contract profitability which has gotten -- which has been sequentially better in quarter three as compared to quarter two and then again in quarter four as compared to quarter three. We have seen improvements in our business operations cost and so when you peel back the P&L and you look at the underpinning, if you will, of our operating expense structure against our revenues we have had some good improvement in the second half of the year which we will build from further as we move into fiscal '15. ","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus & Company","Thank you for that. And then just on the cash flow, if my math is right, it looks like your fiscal '15 guidance for free cash flow may actually exceed net income and again recognizing there are going to be several moving pieces in a given year, can you help us understand the various puts and takes this year other than the lower bonus accrual last year?","David P. Rowland","Yeah, David, the free cash flow to net income metric is 1.1, that within the range it's 1.1 which puts us back in the same territory as where we have been in many years in the past. When you really step back, I mean at a high level when you really step back and look at our cash flow there is a number of things which drive it. One is the efficiency of our cash operating expenses in the year. So our cash operating expense efficiency in relation to the revenue. ","The second thing that would be a driver would be the year-over-year change in DSO and I\u2019ll point out that while we\u2019re very pleased with our DSO, even when the day increase that we had in the fourth quarter we have allowed in our free cash flow guidance the possibility of a continued uptick of a day, to day and a half in that range. Certainly we\u2019ll work hard to try to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen but we\u2019ve allowed for that, so that\u2019s a factor. ","The other factor would be large cash outflows. You mentioned what we payout in variable comp is one, but another big swing factor is tax cash payments. Tax cash payments are a significant cash outflow for a company of our size and they can vary significantly year-to-year and they will be higher next year than they were this year. ","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus & Company","Thank you. ","David P. Rowland","Hopefully that helps. ","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus & Company","No, it does, thank you very much.","David P. Rowland","All right, thank you. ","Operator","Darrin Peller, Barclays. ","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Thanks, I just want to talk a little bit about the cash strategy and the capital structure strategy for a moment, because I mean you are in a year now where clearly you\u2019re showing some pretty good trends on the key revenue segments, you have. I mean financials are going, as you guys said very well, the Healthcare segment\u2019s growing well again and you had some very good growth in constant currency in the quarter relative to the beginning of the year. When we look at that and we look at your underlying EPS growth it\u2019s still less than 10% just given the dynamic of margin expansion being 10 to 30 basis points. ","And what I'm trying to figure out here is your cash use, you said 2% is going to -- the share counts have come down by about 2%, can you just give us your thoughts, maybe Pierre. on sort of how the company thinks about EPS growth in the framework of the long-term strategy, what kind of target are you really looking at over the long haul because you definitely have more cash flow that could be put to work especially if you think about using your balance sheet?","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah I mean let me start and David will give more comments on this. Our capital allocation strategy and cash allocation strategy have always been very clear and very straightforward as you know. The different buckets where we\u2019re using the cash would be internally to fund our capital expenditure. The second bucket will be around acquisitions and what we\u2019ve seen these last three years as we\u2019ve been ramping up the acquisition and we will continue to do so as long as we could find the right opportunities. But this is our expectation that we will continue to deploy capital to acquisition. ","We set in our mental model something around 15% of the operating free cash flow, if I'm right, and it might be anything between 15% to 20% because we believe, based on our results, that we\u2019ve demonstrated we can make the right acquisition in order to create new capabilities and boost organic growth on top of that. And then the rest, our strategy has always been to return a very significant portion of our cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend. ","What you\u2019ve seen from a dividend standpoint, very consistent to what we said is the kind of, I would say evolution on the way we are delivering our dividend with some, what I would quantify solid, even robust increase year-over-year and then we continue on our share repurchase strategy to make sure and this is what we communicated in an IR Day a couple of years ago that we will continue to make sure there are not going to be any dilution between the shares we are issuing as well the share repurchase. ","So we are on that strategy very clearly and it\u2019s still the strategy we\u2019re planning to execute moving forward but maybe David you can give more color. ","David P. Rowland","Yeah, in fact you summarized it very well. When you look at\u2026"," ","Pierre Nanterme","I am applying to be the next CFO. ","David P. Rowland","I think that was a good one really, Pierre. In terms of the 2% which you referenced, that\u2019s in the range of really what we\u2019ve done on average since we\u2019ve been a public company. I think that I haven\u2019t looked at the calculated number lately but I think it\u2019s probably like 3% and probably the average, that reflects what we did in the earlier years of being a public company but 2% to 3% is the range that we\u2019ve been in. When you look at our EPS range this year which is a 5% to 8% growth in USD terms, this was a year where we do have two headwinds that you don\u2019t necessarily have in every year, one is the 2% FX drag and then the other is we do have, you know a higher expected tax rate. ","And so, you look at the 5% to 8% in the context of covering an FX drag and in this particular year a higher tax rate and then you can start to extrapolate what you think is possible in years when we don\u2019t have those. And so that kind of gives you the, maybe a way to think about our EPS.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right, that\u2019s very helpful. Just one quick follow-up, last, through the year margins were a little below what you expected, you are now calling back once again for 10 to 30 basis points of margin expansion in line with how you guys like to deliver? So I mean, can we say, is it fair to say that the pricing pressure or the outsourcing questions that we had seen that may have affected that has been steady or potentially abating now, it\u2019s getting better?","David P. Rowland","I would say that the inflection point that we saw in the first half of the year is more stable but yeah, the trend continues. I think what we saw in the first half of the year was an inflection point where there was a period of acceleration, which I had pointed out at the time as not unusual. We\u2019ve had to manage through inflection points previously and so that\u2019s what we are doing now. ","On the pricing overall and if I talk about pricing in the context of the margin quality, on the deal -- on our bookings, our pricing I will say now has improved in the second half of the year. I was hesitant to say that in the third quarter because we don\u2019t want to kind of jerk back and forth on pricing, we want to see a trend. ","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Right, right.","David P. Rowland","But now that I have seen the two quarter strung together our pricing as defined as the margin quality of the work we put on the books was better in the second half of the year then it was in the first half of the year. So in that sense we have seen improved pricing in the second half of the year.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","That\u2019s good to hear, thanks guys.","David P. Rowland","All right, thank you.","Operator","Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan","","Great, thanks good morning. Just I wanted to ask -- I just want to ask about the visibility into the 10 to 30 as well on the operating margin. I am especially curious about gross margin because I heard the comments on taking actions on improving profitability. Is that action, it sounds like also work to do, so is that subject to market conditions in terms of what you are going to do or is there something that\u2019s in flight today, just trying to get a better appreciation of again the visibility into that 10 to 30.","David P. Rowland","Yeah, I mean it\u2019s really, if you think about it Tien-Tsin there is -- maybe I\u2019d call out four things that we are focused on to deliver the 10 to 30 and some of these are things that you\u2019ll understand very well. The first thing at the core of what we are focused on is overall payroll efficiency. And we\u2019ve referenced that in certain parts of our business as we had this inflection point there were some payroll inefficiencies that had resulted from that which we would address beginning in the second half of the year and we have done just that. ","That is ongoing but yet what we have done so far has some benefit in to next year but job number one would -- margin expansion for us is payroll efficiency. And I think we\u2019ve proven that if you look at it over a period of time we are very good at doing that but we are certainly not immune to having a quarter or two where business conditions change where you can\u2019t just turn the dial at the moment.","The second thing we are focused on is our overall contract profitability and that means for each dimension of work we do we are working to optimize the profitability in the context of that market. So if you take what we do in Digital or Application Services or Accenture Strategy as an example. But then the other part of that is that we have a diverse set of businesses within Accenture now and so the other dial is making sure that we have the right mix across the different offerings, businesses that we have so that at the portfolio level we\u2019re optimizing the overall contract profitability.","The third thing that we are focused on is business operations efficiency, which is you know the cost of us just running and managing our business which is an ongoing objective and so maybe I\u2019ll just stop there. Those are the three big things and we have our sights set on actions around each of those areas. Now it's too -- it's on us to deliver. But there isn't anything that happened in this year, even reflecting on our second quarter call, there is not anything that's happened this year that has taken our eyes off of our focus on modest margin expansion which we've defined as 10 to 30 basis points. ","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Okay, now that's helpful. So can you just quickly elaborate on, I don\u2019t if you gave on headcount growth targets this year and as my, not a real follow-up just the acquisition contribution in fiscal '15. I'm curious how overall acquisitions are performing and we've seen some larger acquisitions in this space and I am curious if your appetite to do deals has changed in anyway? That's all I have, thanks.","David P. Rowland","Let me comment first on the inorganic '14 to '15 and then may be Pierre would want to comment just on our acquisition philosophy and strategy. So Tien-Tsin you will remember that on the last call I said that the inorganic contribution would in the 1.5% to 2% range, in '14 to be clear. I'll just remind everyone that we measure inorganic on a rolling four quarter basis. So from the time an acquisition comes on the books for four quarters we include in our inorganic number, after that it becomes part of our organic engine if you will. ","So where we landed the year is that the inorganic contribution was, which we felt very good about was closer to 2% than 1.5%. And we do expect next year that part of this is just the timing of -- we had our most significant acquisition activity in the first half of this year. So the timing is such that the inorganic contribution next year will be closer to the 1% range. And so when you think about organic growth in '15 that's all in the mix of the 4% to 7% as well. We feel very good about what we see in our organic business and hence we've got the range of 4% to 7% even with the lower contribution of the inorganic. ","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, on acquisition I mean what you've seen this last couple of years is all the efforts we made and yielding results now to position our portfolio of businesses for growth in this new environment of mainly digital computing world. And so we've been working hard on this and we've been using acquisition to accelerate this repositioning, especially in two areas of our business. One is at what we are calling now Accenture Digital and the other one being Accenture Operations.","We have really channeled significantly our investment in these two areas to answer -- to provide the right response to the market which is quite keen to buy on digitalization and on the other end on rationalization. We deployed, if I remember well, around $800 million in fiscal year '15. $740 million in fiscal year '14, so it\u2019s giving you a sense about the kind of level of cash we might deploy in the context of the strategy, which doesn\u2019t mean that if we have the opportunity we can\u2019t do more.","If we believe there is an opportunity we need to capture that would significantly enhance our capabilities, both in the digital world or in the operations world or in some of our markets around the world and we will be prepared to step in. Again we're not changing the overarching philosophy. We are making acquisition to grow on top of these acquisitions and to acquire unique and differentiated capability. We can grow then organically. And this is exactly what we did with Procurian and this is exactly what we did in past with acquisition of [Richfield], avVenta and [Acceria].","So this is the mental model, capabilities deploying in the range of $800 million plus the opportunity to deploy more, if it is necessary with always the perspective to scale and to scale rapidly to take a market leading position. ","Operator","James Friedman, Susquehanna. Please go ahead. ","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group","Hi, thank you. Pierre in the fiscal Q2 conference call you had suggested that Accenture Digital, I think the language used was growing solid double digit. I was wondering if you would be comfortable giving us an update as to the growth rate as of the end of the year. ","Pierre Nanterme","Regarding Digital?","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group","Digital, yeah.","Pierre Nanterme","I am taking this opportunity to -- I was very pleased to read and very impressed with the note you communicated on us and I liked especially the call to action, a good offense is a good defense and I think this is exactly what we do at Accenture. We\u2019re always playing offense. And indeed for us playing offense is to take some very significant steps in the digital because this is the segment of the market which is growing well. We anticipated that few years ago and we definitely accelerated our growth strategy regarding digital.","If you will today and probably for the first time we\u2019re going to communicate this number outside but we feel very confident that we can communicate that number of our digital business because it\u2019s extremely analytical based and the scope is very precise. Today what we\u2019re doing with Accenture Digital is around 17% of our business growing in the double digit. So around $5 billion revenue in fiscal year \u201914 at Accenture and I'm indeed very pleased with that because this is a business which is growing fast double digit, which is extremely relevant for clients and which is now meaningful in the business of Accenture when you\u2019re starting to hit the 17%, trending certainly to the 20% of the business it is a meaningful business and I'm extraordinarily pleased with repositioning we\u2019ve been undertaking. ","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group","I\u2019ll need to pay more attention to my titles now that I know you\u2019re reading them. I wanted to ask in that same regard, do you have any observations, Pierre about which operating groups it\u2019s more prevalent in or which geographies it\u2019s more prevalent in, those would be my follow-ups, thank you. ","Pierre Nanterme","Yeah, sure. I mean what\u2019s good, if you will or impressive is Digital is pervasive across the patch. So it\u2019s clearly a set of technologies and I'm talking about of course the digital consumer, the digital enterprise, the digital operations all related to analytics, of course cloud enabling technologies, usually known as SMAC in the past or [mobile] and each cloud is absolutely pervasive across the board. So we\u2019re starting to see good traction of course with more the B2C kind of industries if you will, I'm thinking about retail, I'm thinking about consumer good, financial services, telecom, good appetite for that but certainly we see the second wave of digital impacting now more the B2C businesses, I could have mentioned Healthcare. ","So Healthcare is probably an hybrid because it\u2019s B2C as well as B2B and then you move in to more the manufacturing kind of organization with what we know we call it the famous IOT, the Internet of things and we are taking step as well to move from the B2C to do B2B2C and from the B2B and from the digital consumer to the Internet of things. So the early adopters we are very pleased with them. They are the usual suspects but now we see good traction in all the parts of the business. ","And I'm thinking even about the resources where we\u2019re starting to put digital in what we are calling digital plant and digital operations and things we\u2019re doing with some of our partners and we\u2019ve recently created joint ventures as you might have seen with General Electric around aircraft maintenance as well as intelligent pipeline, which is the new launch we made with General Electric. And on the other side of the spectrum with Siemens around the SmartGrid. So extremely pleased to answer that question, I guess you see my excitement playing the offense. ","Operator","Lisa Ellis, Sanford Bernstein. ","Lisa Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","","Good morning guys, happy to be joining these calls. I wanted to ask a couple of questions about the labor market and get your take on how you\u2019re seeing trends in the labor market, if I just look at -- your attrition picked up again this quarter, gross profit has ticked down and looks like your accrued payroll is down year-on-year. So you could read into that, that you\u2019re seeing some labor pressure in service delivery, especially given your GDN mix has been constant now for six or seven quarters. So just want to see if that\u2019s kind of consistent with what you\u2019re seeing and in that context how you see that trending going into next year?","David P. Rowland","Yes I would -- maybe let me just pick up on the last thing you said if the read through, if you read through is that we\u2019re seeing in, in service delivery -- by the way, Lisa welcome to the call. I\u2019ll just go back and point out again that our contract profitability which is our service delivery has actually improved sequentially the last two quarters. So that is on an upward trend. ","Lisa, you also referenced gross margin and there is a lot of things that go into gross margin beyond just the contract delivery cost. You have for example things like training and recruiting and we typically bring a lot of people on broad in the fourth quarter and this year that was especially true as our revenue is growing, as an example. You have other things that would impact, for example I referenced supply side actions that we have taken in those parts of our business where we are dealing aggressively with fine tuning the overall payroll efficiency and when we do that those costs can go through gross margin. And then there can be the normal ebb and flow whereas in one quarter we can have a lot of business development activity and in other quarter just even beyond new hires you might have a heavy training quarter and the overall payroll efficiency isn\u2019t changing just where people charge their time as. ","That\u2019s why we repeatedly say that to understand our business you really have to focus on operating margin. And that\u2019s really the bottom line. Lisa you also referenced the attrition number going up, which I called out. It did go up but at the 15% level that\u2019s well within our range and really frankly well within the norm of services companies like ours. ","We focus everyday on our people, on market relevant compensation, on employee engagement, which we measure regularly, on polled surveys et cetera that is a core part of our culture and that will always be taking care of our people and our clients first is really what we focus on. ","Lisa Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Terrific. And then my follow-up is actually on the BPO side. You highlighted that or called that out as one area of particular strength. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what service lines in particular and is the service mix in there evolving as you are seeing increased demand on BPO?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, absolutely. So BPO which is now part of what we are calling Accenture Operations where we put together our infrastructure services and business process services, if you will, to create what we believe is going to be a unique value proposition in the marketplace, in the context of moving more and more BPO, provide more and more BPO as a service on platforms and all of these cloud enabled. So all of this -- this is the essence of the creation of Accenture Operations and again I think we are making in the market very significant steps because as far as I know we are the only one today, are proposing this opportunity.","So BPO is an excellent answer to what I called before the renationalization agenda of our clients to get more efficiency and more productivity. Again BPO is pretty hot across the board when you are looking at our results and especially around what we are calling the [original] tools, Finance and Accounting, HR Administration and of course procurement where we are clearly now the market leader. We are selling these three capabilities for reduced input across all the industries. I am thinking about recent win in financial services with a European Bank where we are now driving all their finance and accounting operation. ","Of course from an F&A we\u2019ve communicated around this big win with this oil and gas company in Europe, a giant as well, we are doing all the HR, Administration of one of the largest consumer good company in the world and I can mention this and extremely recently in electronic equipment we\u2019ve been selected to be clearly their backbone in running their Finance and Accounting, their HR, their IT and part of their sourcing operation to support them in one of their largest scale transformation program today in the industry. ","So it is pretty hot and again I am coming back at the heart of our -- at what I call repositioning or what I think our business is if you will from what we were and we are still famous for the more classic ERP and technology business. We continue and of course to be competitive in that space but we added two big engines for growth at scale, double-digit extra meaningful for Accenture, Accenture Digital on one hand. I mentioned this $5 billion business and Accenture Operations on the other hand which is another formidable machine for growth.","KC McClure ","","Steve we have time for one more question then Pierre is going to wrap up the call. ","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of David Togut of Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Thank you. Good morning Pierre and David.","David P. Rowland","Hey good morning David. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Good morning, could you quantify for us the 2015 average wage increase and also the average price increase for 2015? ","David P. Rowland","David, the answer -- I guess the short answer is no. The reason is that when we quote a number like that on the wage side it just potentially creates a lot of confusion within our employee base, where it varies so much country-to-country and to have an overall average number sometimes just creates confusion. Maybe I'll just stop there. We really can't comment on either one of those, sorry about that but\u2026 ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","But for context, David we see attrition going up for the last two quarters and that would suggest for an environment of rising wages. Can you just bracket for us possible ranges, so we can understand the gross margin question a little better?","David P. Rowland","I mean what I can say is there is nothing unusual with respect to our wage increases in '15. They are -- so there is -- I guess I could say there is nothing unusual. There is nothing, there is no -- while there is nothing unusual in response to what you perceive to be perhaps a building issue, I think that certainly their markets and skills were -- that are in higher demand and when we see those we respond very proactively with what we do with our comp. ","But there are also a lot of markets around the world where there is deflation and deflationary trends for compensation and so -- what we always do is we're market relevant. And so if you're trying to understand is there anything unusual that we anticipate in '15 with respect to wage increases, the answer to that is no. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Thank you. That's very helpful. ","David P. Rowland","Okay, thank you. ","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you everybody and thanks a lot for all your good questions this morning. Just in closing the call and reflecting on what might happen moving forward and as we enter fiscal year '15, I am confident in our ability to drive profitable growth and to deliver our business outlook for the year. We have momentum in our business. We are investing in new capabilities to be even more relevant, differentiated and competitive. And with our highly diverse portfolio of business combined with the disciplined management of our operations we are well positioned to deliver sustainable long term profitable growth.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, KC McClure. Please go ahead.","KC McClure","Thank you, Roxanne. And thanks everyone for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings announcement. As Roxanne just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.","We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016. We will then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.","As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we\u2019re talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.","We are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and the strong momentum we have built in our business. I am particularly pleased that we again delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency, gaining significant market share. Our research clearly demonstrates that we are executing our strategy very well, further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace.","Here are a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $9.1 billion, bringing us to $26.4 billion for the year to date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency. Operating margin was 15.5%, an expansion of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the third quarter last year.","We delivered earnings per share of $1.41, up 8% from adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.5 billion. And we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","So, we have delivered excellent third-quarter results. And as we enter the fourth quarter I feel very good about our business and I am confident in our ability to deliver our business outlook for the year.","Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, our third quarter results were strong across almost every dimension of our business. Once again our results demonstrate the power of our highly differentiated growth strategy which is built on five businesses, delivered in an industry relevant context and focused on being the market leader and helping our clients rotate to The New.","Looking out our results at a high level, there are few major themes which I think are important to note. First, 10% local currency growth marks the 7th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. These results were strong indication of the durability of our growth model, which is underpinned by our focus on achieving market leading scale across our key industries and geographic markets.","This is best illustrated by our broad based growth in the third quarter which reflected double digit growth in 8 industries and 8 geographic markets. And strong double digit growth in The New especially in digital related services continue to be a key driver of our results.","Second, operating margin of 15.5%, 10 basis points higher than last year's adjusted results was consistent with our objective to deliver modest margin expansion while investing significantly in our people and our business.","Our profitability agenda is enabled by our drive to achieve fit-for-purpose economics across each of our five businesses. We're pleased with our progress year-to-date which has yielded 10 basis points of operating margin expansion and 10% growth in EPS on an adjusted basis, while at the same time creating the capacity to make important investments for long term market leadership.","Third, as expected we generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.5 billion and return roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We're well positioned to deliver free cash flow and excess of net income for the full year and importantly we continue to invest to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas, investing roughly $835 million across 11 acquisitions through the third quarter.","So we're very pleased with our results in quarter three which combined with our first half results position us very well to achieve all of our key financial objectives for the year.","With that said let's get into the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.1 billion for the quarter, consulting bookings were 4.9 with the book-to-bill of $1.1, outsourcing bookings were 4.2 also with the book-to-bill of $1.1. We\u2019re very pleased with our overall new bookings particularly in consulting which represented the second highest new bookings quarter following the record set in quarter two.","Looking at bookings by business, our new bookings results were highlighted by strong demand in operations which had an estimated book-to-bill of 1.4. Strategy in consulting services combined had an estimated book-to-bill above 1.0, well within our target book-to-bill range and application services had a book-to-bill of 1.0.","Across the board digital related services continue to be a significant driver. Additionally, we had 10 clients with new bookings in excess of $100 million and year-to-date we've delivered $26.4 billion in new bookings reflecting 9% growth in local currency.","Turning to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, a 9% increase in USD and 10% in local currency reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of slightly less than 2%. Our consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 12% in USD and 14% in local currency and our outsourcing revenues were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency.","The trends in revenue growth across our business dimensions were very similar to last quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined posted another quarter of strong double-digit growth, operations again had double-digit growth and application services grew high single-digits and across those four businesses, digital related services were significant contributor to growth with estimated growth in the range of 30%.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, products led all operating groups with 16% growth reflecting strong overall momentum in the business. Growth continues to be broad based with double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. H&PS grew 12% in the quarter driven by very strong growth in North America and the growth markets, as well as in the health business. We're also pleased with strong growth in public service especially in North America and the growth markets.","Financial services also grew 12% led by very strong growth overall in banking and capital markets with solid growth across all other dimensions. Communications, Media & Technology delivered strong growth of 8% which was consistent with our expectations. From an industry perspective, electronics and high-tech, as well as media and entertainment continued their strong double-digit growth. Communications revenue was flat driven by modest declines in Europe and North America offset by double-digit growth in the growth markets.","Lastly resources grew 1% in the quarter. The two divergent trends within resources continued with utilities again delivering strong double-digit growth across all three geographic regions while energy and chemicals and natural resources remain challenged due to cyclical headwinds.","Moving down to income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.9% compared to 32.5% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.3% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 5.3% compared to 5.8% for the same quarter last year.","As a reminder, in quarter three of last year, we recorded a non-cash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. The following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results.","Operating income was $1.3 billion in the third quarter reflecting a 15.5% operating margin up 10 basis points compared with quarter three last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.7% in the third quarter last year.","Net income was $950 million for the third quarter compared with net income of $889 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.41, compared with EPS of $1.30 in the third quarter last year reflecting 8% year-over-year growth.","Turning to DSOs, our day services outstanding were 41 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 37 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.6 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $94 million.","Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at May 31 was $3.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. Turning to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with global headcount of over 375,000 people, our utilization was 91% compared to 90% last quarter and attrition which excludes involuntary terminations was 15% up 2% from quarter two and consistent with the same period last year.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter we repurchased or redeemed 4.3 million shares for $478 million at an average price of $112.44 per share. As of May 31, we had approximately 5.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","Finally as Pierre mentioned on May 13, 2016, we made our second semi-annual dividend payment for fiscal 2016 in the amount of $1.10 per share bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. So with three quarters in the books, we are very pleased with our results and we are now focused on quarter four and closing out a strong year.","Let me turn it back over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David.","Our very strong results in the third quarter demonstrate that we are executing the right growth strategy and that we are providing highly relevant services to our clients. We are benefiting from the investments we've made to rotate our business to The New, digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for approximately 40% of our total revenues.","Let me share a few examples of how we are leading in The New. We continue to see true demand for our digital capabilities. And we were very pleased that Accenture Interactive was recognized by Advertising Age magazine as the largest and fastest-growing provider of digital marketing services.","Through Accenture Interactive, we are bringing our unique combination of design and customer experience capabilities to 70 companies in the Fortune Global 100. In cloud we are focused on building strong platforms for key industries such as our life science cloud for R&D. This truly innovative solution to collect, share and analyze clinical data is now being used by seven top pharma companies, including Pfizer, Merck, GSK and Lilly to accelerate drug development and improve patient outcome.","In security, we're expanding our capabilities with the acquisition of Maglan, a cyber security Company based in Israel with strong expertise in cyber defense. And we just opened a new Accenture Lab in Israel that is dedicated to cyber R&D in threat intelligence, incidence response and internet of things security. This is all about helping clients become more resilient in today's digital world.","We continue to see strong demand from clients to help them with their most complex mission-critical issues. In Accenture Strategy, we have developed a unique approach to help clients make sustainable improvements in their enterprise-wide performance. We are now a leader in this space, with a totally new zero-based methodology which we have delivered with excellent results at many consumer goods companies, including Unilever and Mondelez. We are now taking this approach to clients in health care, retail and financial services.","We continue to invest across our business to drive growth and further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. During the quarter we announced two acquisitions. We are taking a majority stake in IMJ, one of Japan's leading digital agencies. And we acquired OPS Rules, an analytics consulting company, to expand our capabilities in machine learning, supply chain and operations analytics.","We continue to collaborate with leading players in the tech ecosystem to further strengthen our capabilities in cutting edge technologies. We work with IPsoft, a market leader in artificial intelligence to launch a new practice focused on its virtual agent platform which is called Amelia. Our new practice will help clients leverage artificial intelligence to realize efficiency gains and generate new growth opportunities.","And we continue to invest to drive even more innovation and productivity in our global delivery network. We launched a new intelligence automation platform called Accenture myWizard, to deliver smarter and more efficient application services. We are already using myWizard with more than 200 clients to drive productivity improvements.","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I continue to be very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are driving across all three of our geographic regions and especially in our largest markets.","In North America, we delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth once again in the United States, bringing us to eight quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the U.S.","In Europe we delivered 12% revenue growth in local currency. I am particularly pleased that almost all of our largest markets generated double-digit growth, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France. And in growth markets we grew revenues 6% in local currency, led primarily by double-digit growth in Japan, as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India, and Mexico.","Before I turn it back to David, I want to reflect on a couple of Accenture core strengths that are particularly important to our future growth. The first is our portfolio of intellectual property. Over the years, we have made a significant investment and now have more than 5,000 patents and patent-pending applications in areas such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, drones, virtual agents, internet of things and other platforms.","Our intellectual property is an important asset which drives differentiation and value in the marketplace. Second is our brand. I am proud that Accenture was just ranked number 38 on BrandZ's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands, our highest ever on this list.","Again, our brand strengthens our unique positioning in the marketplace and drives significant competitive advantage. It reflects the trust our clients place in us and enables us to attract top talent. So with the first three quarters of the year behind us, I'm very pleased with our performance. We have very good momentum in our business and I feel confident that we are well positioned to deliver a strong fiscal year 2016.","With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre.","Let me now turn to summarize our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 1% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year 2016, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 4.5% compared to fiscal 2015. For the full fiscal 2016, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% growth in local currency over fiscal 2015.","For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2016 to be 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2015 results. As a reminder, we closed our Navitaire transaction last quarter which lowered the full year FY 2016 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal 2016 excludes the impact of this transaction.","We continue to expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $5.29 to $5.33 or 10% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal 2015 results.","Turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to continue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.","Finally we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning the substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s open it up so that we can take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Hi, good morning. Operating margin guidance to start the year, I think was 10 to 30 basis points, which has been your historical practice. This year it sounds like you will only do 10 basis points expansion. Just want to make sure I understand why the low end this year. And does that change anything going forward about your historical typical practice of 10 to 30 basis points of expansion.","David Rowland","So Bryan if you look at the 10 to 30 as you well know and the others know that has been kind of our target range for many years now. And if you look at our results over the last five years, we covered the full scope of that range including having been at 10 basis points expansion at least once if not twice in that period, and I think one year been at 30 basis points.","So, we've covered the expense of that range and so coming in a 10 basis points this year isn't in consistent with kind of our historical performance. Having said that, if you look at where we are year-to-date, we\u2019re at 10 basis points of expansion through the first three quarters and so at this point based on what we see, it just feels very clear to us that we are trending in that direction.","I think the important point to note and this is different about this year versus other years where we've been at 10 basis points of expansion is that we embarked on a journey especially a few years ago to really raise our gain in the investments that we\u2019re making in our business including but not limited to the significant capital investments that we've made an acquisitions which also flow through our P&L.","And so when you look at the 10 basis points, it really is a direct intention of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish by positioning our business for the long term by investing at a scale that is truly differentiated in our sector and positions us for long term leadership.","And so we\u2019re actually very pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion and that it on one hand supports - we believe double digit growth in EPS but on the other hand underneath it, it represents significant investments that we're making in our business and our people.","And last comment that I\u2019ll make is that, if you were to look at our underline margin expansion, excluding the investments, the underlying margin expansion is quite healthy and would compare very favorably to what we've done in any previous year.","So, we feel great about the economic leverage in our model and we feel great about the - the focus that we\u2019ve had on investing.","Bryan Keane","Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up. At the Analyst Day I think you mentioned the potential to hire around 100,000 gross heads. It doesn't look like you are on track for that. I was looking for an update on gross hires for the fiscal year. Thanks to much and congrats on the quarter.","David Rowland","Thank you, Bryan. I think last year we commented that our hiring was going to be over 100,000, this year it will be less than a 100,000 and I might add that we are quite pleased with that result. We view that as a positive outcome in the way we are able to - let\u2019s say moderate our headcount growth in recent quarters well at the same time supporting continued strong topline growth, I mean that's an equation that we like.","Bryan Keane","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman, Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.","David Grossman","Hi, good morning, thank you. I was wondering if we could look at the overall business. Recently we've talked about the ebb and flow of the business and the shifting priorities, which has favored consulting growth versus outsourcing. Can you help us understand whether that trend continues at the same rate or whether that's beginning to equalize?","Pierre Nanterme","As you look at our business and indeed these last few years, all the industries in all the markets are under significant transformation. They want to transform their business and the different industries, what we call, rotate to The New in all the digital space. They want as well to improve their operational efficiency and they want to implement new capabilities.","So at the end of the day, if you look at the nature of the transformation of our industries, they are more related to consulting type of services. This is the nature of the demand because of the unique nature of the transformation in the industries.","If you look back a few years ago where outsourcing was going to be stronger, it was absolutely linked to the fact that you have less need for true industry transformation and innovative play. And the industries were more looking for straightforward efficiency gains. And to some extent, to a great extent, the natural answer we provided at Accenture to straightforward efficiency gain through around the outsourcing arbitrage, more productivity, tackling the cost in operation and in IT.","So I feel this natural shift from a bit of outsourcing, a bit less of outsourcing, to a bit more of consulting is reflecting the true nature of the transformation in the industries. And by the way, we feel extremely good about our positioning in this rotation, if you will, based on our industry image based on the investments we made in rotating to The New. Based on the fact that we still have significant capability at great scale to tackle the cost efficiency programs from our clients.","David Grossman","So no real material change in the pace, Pierre, of how that is migrating to the market?","David Rowland","We see that trend continuing, yes.","Pierre Nanterme","Definitely, we see that trend continuing. You have cycles. We are in a cycle of transformation for all the reasons we all know are on the call. And I guess the cycle will continue as long as the industries will be in this transformational phase.","David Grossman","Very good, thanks. Just one quick follow-up. I wonder if you could quickly contrast your comment about IT and how you view IP at Accenture versus perhaps how a product company views IP.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, very pleased. For us, IP is very important. That's why I wanted in that call to put the attention on our IP population. It's something we've been talking about, we have so many things to discuss with all of you. But we've been very active from an IP standpoint and especially as, again, we are in a phase of reinvention and in a phase of innovation. Reinvention, innovation, equals intellectual property building.","And for us we are building intellectual property is in many things - and you're right - it's more than products or sometimes we feel that IP equals software or application product. And IP could be behind processes, operating models. There are a lot of things you can - methodologies, approaches, part of solutions and this is all what we do.","And I was quite impressed recently when I've been reviewing the IP portfolio with our 5,000 patents or patent-pending activities. I felt that it would be good for me to share that with all of you as, again, an element where Accenture is quite on top of its game in order to drive innovation and to perfect, more important, our innovation inside Accenture for the benefit of our clients and for the benefit of our investors.","David Grossman","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi, Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","Hi, my first question here is what are the challenges in growing digital at this point? Do you think the growth rate can keep up there? And are you finding enough talent? And maybe even some color on the margins in that business would be great","Pierre Nanterme","Good question. So far, so good. It's every day we're working on it at Accenture. And as you see, we've been extraordinarily active these last few years, certainly three, four years. Every day we are taking actions. These actions are to grow, if you will. In order to lead in The New, you need skills and capabilities and we've been very active from a talent standpoint.","All the credit to our operating group leads, but as well to Ellyn Shook, I would like to recognize during the call here our Chief HR Officer leading all our talent agenda, and we are very active. I would like as well to recognize Roxanne Taylor from a brand standpoint because brand is absolutely key in attracting talents. That's why I wanted as well in that call to put some emphasis on the brand because it's very important in our strategy to attract talent.","Of course, we've been very active from an acquisition standpoint. You've seen us raising our game these last four years and this is our objective, to continue with that pace moving forward as long as we could find relevant companies, relevant acquisitions, that will bring their capabilities.","But we need to continue as well to invest on an organic standpoint. We developed our own platforms. I'm thinking about Accenture cloud platform. I'm thinking about Accenture currency platform in analytics, in marketing and so forth.","So we are very active across the patch of digital. Of course, as you will see, our digital is covering interactive, mobility, analytics, cloud, security. We are even now considering the next play. I'm thinking about artificial intelligence. So far I feel good. You're right to ask the question. It's a everyday commitment from Accenture to invest in The New and to lead in The New. And I'm pleased with the momentum we are creating and I see that continuing.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. And as my follow-up, to go back to the margin question, with acquisition activity being strong over the last couple of years and you needing to invest in digital, which is obviously growing very well and driving the business, should we expect a moderation in that 10 to 30 basis points typical margin expansion target? Or is that still the case going forward? Because it seems like you're in a heavy investment mode and I was wondering how to think about that going forward. Thanks.","David Rowland","Well first of all, certainly I\u2019m not going to provide guidance on this call and I will come back to that question if I can just ask for your patience, I will come back to that question in more detail at the Investor Analyst Day in October.","What I will say is that our focus on investing at scale doesn't end this year. This is a cycle that we\u2019re in but I will also tell you as I mentioned the last two investment, analyst days and I referenced again in the script we are very focused on this journey of managing our business in a fit for purpose way which is really our platform for creating underlying profitability improvement in our business to both support our ambition for higher investments but also support our ambition for margin expansion as a way to support our goals to grow EPS.","And I would say the general rule, the economic leverage that we have in our model hasn\u2019t changed and in fact I might say in some ways, we have new and exciting opportunities as we think about this move to fit for purpose focus and how we manage and drive our business. But I will get more specific on all of that in October.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg, Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Good morning guys. Hey, David. Just wanted to get a quick clarification on one of the answers you gave to - I think it may have been Bryan's question about headcount growth this year, new hires. It sounded like you were alluding to nonlinear dynamics perhaps, between headcount growth and revenue growth, if I heard you correctly.","And I just wanted to clarify that, because it looks like billable headcount year-to-date has actually grown faster than revenue. But I just wanted to clarify what you were referencing there.","David Rowland","Yes, what I was referencing was first of all just the fact that we will hire fewer people this year than we did last year is one point. The second thing I was referencing is it, if you look at our sequential growth in headcount and recent growth quarters, it\u2019s certainly moderated over let\u2019s say the prior 7, 8 quarters and probably beyond.","The third thing I was referencing although I didn\u2019t say it specifically is that it is true if you look at our headcount growth in the third quarter year-over-year, it was at a rate above our revenue but that rate above our revenue was less than what you\u2019ve seen in recent quarters.","And so there is without getting overly specific, there are three things that factor in to that, one would be our focus on automation as an example and the mix although as we said, that is early days but yet a big focus for us going forward, things like chargeability around the mix, things like attrition levels around the mix, when you consider at hiring number and of course, the revenue yield that we're getting for billable head is also in the mix.","And that can be influenced by things like the mix of work that we're doing across the five business mix of work by geography and it can also include pricing. So, all of those things are kind of in the mix and in some way all of those are contributing to what it has been a more moderate growth sequentially in our headcount and that's really all I was pointing out.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, that's super helpful. Maybe just to pick up on that point around utilization, I think you've been running at 90%-plus for seven straight quarters after never having been at those levels prior to last fiscal year.","So do you feel like this is a new normal and that we're unlikely to see this slip below 90%? And would it also be fair to say that you're maxed out at this 90%, 91% range? Or could there be further head room, depending on how the revenue mix evolves over time?","David Rowland","I guess I won't declare that it's maxed out. There are things that could work in our favor going forward that could influence that metric further. If you look at our historical norm, we are at the higher level of that range for sure. And we are running hot and I think that reflects the activity in the market.","We could come down a click or two in different quarters. And a lot of times that happens with periods in the year where we tend to bring on, let's say, more heads. So for example, in the fourth quarter we have a lot of our new joiners, campus hires that will start with us in the fourth quarter and early in the fall.","So the simple answer is that no doubt we are running at a very high level of utilization, reflecting the dynamics that we see in the market. But we're in a zone right now that we feel very comfortable managing but it could also be a click lower and we wouldn't be worried about that.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, I appreciate the comments. Thanks.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Lisa Ellis, Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Good morning, David. I have a question. In the market it looks like you're seeing that demand for the new digital security services, cloud services, is if anything accelerating. And yet, as I guess a number of folks now have called out, a lot of your forward indicators have decelerated a bit. Headcount growth, the pace of M&A, even though it's still elevated, has slowed down since last year.","So can you comment on that disconnect or how you're thinking about that? Because if anything, it seems like the demand is accelerating, not decelerating, out there.","Pierre Nanterme","I can speak of that. Good morning, Lisa. On the point you're mentioning around deceleration of some of our capabilities, when you're talking about acquisitions it might very well be that we're going to make less transactions than last year, a few. But on the other hand, we will certainly deploy a bit more capital than last year because we expect to close the year with a bit more than $1 billion being deployed.","So I guess it's - so we are not slowing down at all our acquisitions agenda, at least in terms of volume of capital deployed. By the volume of capital deployed it means the capabilities we are bringing back in Accenture. So I do not see on digital, anything in Accenture which would reflect a kind of slowing down of our appetite to grow, of our appetite to invest, and of our appetite to accelerate in The New.","From a net standpoint I will let David comment again.","David Rowland","Lisa, one thing I would point out is that - really, to get underneath your question, you would have to get into the more granular details of our business which are not practical for us to get in externally but let me just make the point that as the business is rotating overall, we are also rotating a lot of talent within our headcount. And so what is not apparent by simply looking at the overall numbers is the talent rotation that is taking place. And I can assure you that our pace of investing and acquiring headcount specifically focused on driving this new agenda, and the digital-related services agenda as part of that, has not slowed down at all.","In fact, I would say the demand for talent in The New and talent in digital-related talent as one example, but also including cloud and security in our business has never been higher.","And it is - as Pierre referenced earlier for Ellyn Shook, that is job number one for her, is managing the talent supply side to fuel The New. And I think our pace of activity is not slowing, if anything, our appetite for that talent is increasing. But it's underneath the overall number that we communicate. So we feel like our indicators are positive indicators right now.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, to build on this, because this is a very important question you're raising, coming back to talent, I know that we have a lot of questions regarding the total headcount. And we're working that very carefully with David to see that we've been able to grow more our revenues with a little bit less hiring of people, which on balance we will all recognize, is a good direction.","If you look from a managing director standpoint, so all of the leadership of Accenture, I just would like to reconfirm that this year in fiscal 2016 we promoted much more managing directors than ever these last 4 years. And I think from a recruiting of leaders, managing directors, we've never been so active in the market in recruiting new leaders.","So it's important to segregate the leadership we are hiring and promoting at scale, because the leaders are driving the business, from the total headcount which we all expect will continue to grow less, a bit less than our revenues moving forward, due to the factor of automation and productivity in our operations.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thank you. That's great color, thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question is from Dave Koning, Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Koning","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. First of all, the digital business, you talked about, it's about 40% of revs, growing about 30%. That would imply that the other 60% is maybe flattish to down.","Maybe you can talk a little bit about that. And then is this the formula that digital keeps growing in that range and the rest of the business is more flattish? Is that the formula going forward?","Pierre Nanterme","I think the formula going forward is very simple. We want to grow. That's our goal in life is to grow and to grow more than the market. In order to grow more than the market, we believe at Accenture and this is at the heart of our strategy, that it's going to be by leading in the digital-related services.","To be clear, we want to make Accenture the leading professional services company in digital-related services. This is what we're working on these last few years and we will continue moving forward. We have evidence that this rotation to The New is happening at big scale.","So the most significant part of our growth will come from digital-related services because this is our strategy, first and second, this is where the demand is. Now, that being said, we want to continue making our core, if you will, extremely competitive in the marketplace.","I just mentioned in the call that we invested in our new intelligent delivery platform called Accenture myWizard which is bringing a lot of success in Accenture. So of course we're growing much less in the core than in The New, which is exactly reflecting our strategy.","Now, the core is still positive, growing less, but it's still positive. And I believe that on the core Accenture is growing more than the competition at the end of the day which has always been our value proposition, is to grow more than the market in The New and much more. And is to grow more than the market in the remaining core which is what we do, of course, at a much lower level and lower pace, but still positive. Right, David?","David Rowland","It is. And David, let me also clarify some subtleties in the way we talk about digital-related services and The New, just to remind you and the others as well.","So, we initially started talking about digital-related services, which was defined specifically to include Accenture Interactive, mobility, and analytics. And digital-related services is what I referenced was growing in the range of 30%.","Following introducing digital-related services several quarters ago, we rolled forward, kind of evolved that, to talk about The New, which includes digital-related services, cloud-related services and security.","With The New, we commented that it is now about 40% of our revenues. We did not comment on the growth rate for The New. But I will say that digital-related services of the three components of The New, is the fastest growing.","So that helps you as well. We talk about The New and digital-related services and it's important to just reinforce the understanding of the definitions.","Dave Koning","Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess the one other question I had, the growth markets grew 6% and then North America and Europe were more like 11% to 12%. I would have thought a few quarters ago that maybe China and Brazil, the gap would have been - the slower growth would have happened but it actually seems like now that gap, the growth markets are growing quite a bit slower than the others. Maybe you can just comment on that a little bit.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, happy to comment. Fact of the matter is growth markets are growing lower than the other two, maybe just because the other two are growing exceptionally well and especially Europe at 12%, which of course is a remarkable achievement.","Now when you look at the growth markets, needless to say that it's a mixed bag of very different situations when we're talking our growth markets. First, we are extremely pleased that we continue with our double-digit growth with Japan. By the way, I don't know and maybe we provide information, how many quarters now we've been growing double-digits in Japan, but it's starting to be spectacular, and of course is a very large market for Accenture.","Not only for the - still what we're calling the growth market, but for Accenture as a whole.","So I'm extraordinarily pleased with the turnaround we've been driving in Japan, with the momentum we are making in Japan and with the acquisition we have made of IMJ in order to accelerate the rotation to The New in Japan.","I am very pleased with the new momentum we are creating China this year, together with India and Mexico. Now, as you know, in the growth markets there are two factors impacting the growth markets. First is these markets are more vulnerable to the commodity markets in terms of energy and natural resources. There are significant countries very dependent on natural resources and energy. And of course they are affected by the commodity price going down, and accordingly we are affected with this factor.","Secondly, the situation in Brazil. We all know what's happening in Brazil. So our growth has been slowing down in a market which is very important for Accenture. That being said, I love being public on this, because I would like to recognize the incredible leadership of Roger Ingold and now Leonardo Framil leading our practice in Brazil, where we're doing more than resisting. When I say more than resisting, it means on a year-to-date standpoint we are growing in Brazil, which is probably according to any standards, a remarkable achievement.","Now, of course we're growing less in Brazil than we used to grow in the past. So on balance, it's a 6% reflecting very different dynamics. This is what - is something I like a lot in Accenture, is our diverse portfolio of businesses where, indeed, when you look at the growth markets, when Brazil is a bit under pressure, all commodity markets, we benefit from growth elsewhere and on balance 7% is pretty good from my perspective.","David Rowland","Yes. If you isolated chemicals and natural resources and energy and then looked at the underlying growth in growth markets, it would be very similar to what we see in the other areas. It has that unique dynamic as well as the other points Pierre mentioned.","Dave Koning","Got you, great. Well, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jim Schneider","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little about financial services. It's an area where you've talked about previously being driven by transformation and that pace continues be pretty strong.","Can you give us any sense about whether you're seeing any tone change from your financial services customers, either in banking or elsewhere in terms of the overall IT spending outlook and that would suggest that we are seeing any slowdown in that pace of change, change-driven services in particular?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. I probably could take this one, David, from my prior role. It seems that all my life I will comment on Europe [indiscernible], but very happy to. First, let's start with the beginning. We're pleased with where we are with financial services overall. If you look at the results we posted this last few quarters, we had good momentum in financial services.","Second, it's an industry which is ongoing some significant rotation to The New for obvious reasons. It's a B to C industry and we have a lot of activities in terms of rotating to The New and creating digital capabilities in financial services. This is as well an industry where we see a lot of potential in what we're calling automation, if you will, to create more automated processes, bringing virtual agents to provide financial advisory services.","So that's the path which is creating some momentum. However, on the other side of the coin, if you will, it's an industry which is still under pressure, especially in Europe, for all sorts of reasons. Negative interest rates have been good, especially in that industry for their commercial business.","The regulatory constraints are high, as you know, with all - especially in Europe with all the Basel legislation and all the constraints which have been put on the banks and so the profitability of the banks been affected these last few years.","So at the same time they need to rotate to The New, but at the same time they need to work on their cost. So there is a bit of this story with our financial services clients, investing in The New but being extremely cautious about their cost play. That's why after this good momentum we have in financial services, we might see some moderation of our growth with our verticals in Europe a bit.","Nothing we are over-worried about because we believe the potential is still there, but it's an industry which is under cost pressure.","Jim Schneider","That's helpful, thank you. And then maybe one for David. DSOs edged back up to 41 and I guess have been on a little bit of an upward trajectory over the last four, six quarters. Can you give us a sense about whether that says anything about the overall cash flow trends for the business and whether that, in fact, is a longer term trend?","David Rowland","Yes, I would say, to be completely transparent, it was a little higher than I would have wanted in the quarter, but yet we still generated very strong cash flow. We are very focused on managing our DSO and I'm hopeful that we will see it click down at the end of the fourth quarter.","As I've said before, first of all, even at the levels that we're at, as you know, you hear us say all the time, we're still very much industry-leading. I do think that we are in the zone of what I think could be a reset, new normal and, let's say, in that 40-day plus or minus zone. And so we'll continue to focus on it as one of our key operational priorities. And I'm hopeful we can continue to manage it in that zone.","Jim Schneider","Thank you.","KC McClure","Roxanne, we have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","So the last question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Good morning. Forgive the noise, I'm at the airport. Just a couple quick ones. What exactly is driving the revenue raise in the guidance here? What areas specifically are running better than expected?","David Rowland","Really the revenue raise is just a reflection of posting roughly 11% growth year-to-date. And if you look at the guidance range of the 6% to 9%, we just simply did the math. If you do the mathematical extension of that, you get to the 9.5% to 10.5% range.","I think in terms of what's driving it of late, products is very, very hot right now. And the thing that is impressive about products, which also happens to be our largest operating group, is that their growth is broad-based across every industry in that operating group, as well as each of the three geographic areas.","And so I would say that what is driving us to a strong close to the year, if you will and hence raising the revenue 0.5 point on the upper end, you would start with products and the strong story there.","Health and public service is another strong story. Very good growth in the third quarter and very strong momentum as we look to the fourth quarter. I would say our business in North America is another source of momentum. If I had to name, let's say, three big drivers, I would pick those two operating groups and North America.","And then of course underneath that, as Pierre covered very well, is the ongoing continued momentum in digital and The New, which we certainly will continue into the fourth quarter.","So those are some of the big themes in terms of driving what we hope will be a good strong close to the year.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. That's helpful, Pierre, thanks. I also wanted to follow up, I think it was David Grossman's question on IP and software and how the deconsolidation of Duck Creek, that action there, how does that fit in the strategy of owning IP and platforms, any comments? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, elaborating a bit on what I said before. So we're working on our IP from, again, from a process standpoint, a metallurgy standpoint, from part of solutions standpoint, and of course, in the context of working with our partners. And it might very well be that we are creating IP on top of some market solutions, which is where we are making the bridge with your question around software, not software.","We are, in our business, we are working with software companies. And the job of Accenture for many years has been to bring an industry expertise, an industry wrapper on top of these solutions. And on this wrapper we are bringing, we're working on protecting our own IP when appropriate and when possible.","This is where at Accenture we make the bridge with the software providers. The software providers are all our friends and we're working with the best possible companies. They are coming to Accenture, that's why we are a good partner to bring industry expertise. And this is on the industry wrapper we could build IP.","David Rowland","Pierre, you want to comment on Duck Creek? He also asked about Duck Creek and how that fits in with our strategy.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. And Duck Creek is clearly a good illustration of what we are doing. Duck Creek is a fantastic company, an excellent solution. We certainly believe this is the best in the marketplace in policy administration, in insurance policy administration in some markets including the United States.","We want to invest more in Duck Creek to establish an even stronger leadership in the different markets of Duck Creek. And we believe that the right way of doing it was to partner with someone who would bring some strength in terms of investing together with us, in that case, Apax Partners.","And we're very pleased that Accenture, together with Apax will be able to invest behind Duck Creek and move Duck Creek solutions to the next level and establish a stronger leadership.","This is all about the new Accenture. At Accenture, we will look always at all the ways to invest, to bring the right solution, to be smart, to be thoughtful and mindful about our capital allocation and at the end of the day, to lead in the market and to lead in The New.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay.","Pierre Nanterme","Okay, thanks again for joining us on today's call. Let me close with a few thoughts on Accenture's long-term performance, which I believe unites all of us, investors, analysts, Accenture leaders and all of our people.","Next month on July 19 we will celebrate the 15-year anniversary of Accenture's IPO. We have performed extremely well over the years by continually reinventing our business. Since our IPO we have delivered compound annual growth of 8% in revenues and 14% in adjusted EPS, creating significant value for our shareholders, for our clients and for our people.","So I want to thank all of you for the support you've been bringing to Accenture over so many years. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC. And all the best to all of you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 10:30 AM today running through September 29, 2016 at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Angie Park. Please go ahead.","Angie Park","Thank you, Shannon and thanks everyone for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings announcement. As Shannon just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.","With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the News Release we issued a short time ago.","Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results.

Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2017.

As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Angie, and thanks everyone for joining us today.","We are very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2017. For the quarter, we again delivered broad based revenue growth across many dimensions of our business and we continued to gain significant market share. We see excellent demand for our services especially in high growth areas such as digital, cloud and security-related. Our very strong bookings culture both are relevant and success of our strategy to rotate our business to the new and support our confidence as we look ahead to the rest of the fiscal year.","Here are a few highlights for the second quarter and year-to-date. We delivered very strong new bookings of $9.2 billion for the quarter and $17.5 billion for the first half. We grew revenue 6% in local currency for the quarter and 7% year-to-date with continued strong growth across many areas of our business.","We delivered earnings per share of $1.33 which brings EPS for the first half of the year to $2.91 an 11% increase on an adjusted basis. Operating margin was 13.7% for the quarter and 14.7% for the six months an expansion of 20 basis points year-to-date. We generated free cash flow of $50 million for the quarter and $1 billion year-to-date. And we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends including more than $2 billion year-to-date.","Today, we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share which would bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.42 per share a 10% increase over last year.","Now with the first half of the year behind us I feel very good about our business. We see very strong demand in the marketplace for differentiated capabilities and remain confident in our ability to deliver our business outlook for the year.","Now let me handover to David who will review the numbers in greater details. David, over to you.","David Rowland","Thanks Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. Overall we delivered strong results in the second quarter which were aligned with our expectations and position us very well to achieve our full-year financial guidance. We continue to see favorable market conditions in most areas of our business especially as it relates to strong demand for digital, cloud, and security related services which placed us straight as a leader in innovating and leading in The New.","Our second quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate our ability to continue to deliver on the essential elements of our formula for driving superior shareholder value. So before I get into the details let me summarize some of the major headlines.","Net revenue growth in local currency is 6% in the second quarter and 7% year-to-date, continues to significantly outpace the market driven by double-digit growth in all three components of The New including digital, cloud, and security related services. Growth continues to be broad based with positive growth in the vast majority of our industries and geographic markets more than offsetting cyclical market pressures that continue in a few concentrated areas of our business specifically energy, chemicals, and natural resources and communications and media.","Absent those concentrated areas of pressure, the majority of our business grew 9% on a quarter to date basis and 10% on a year-to-date basis. Operating margin of 13.7% for the quarter came in as expected and consistent with last year. Operating margin of 14.7% for the first half of the year represents 20 basis points of expansion.","These results continue to reflect significant levels of investments in our business and our people to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness in the marketplace. And on a year-to-date basis, we delivered 11% growth in earnings per share over fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS.","Our free cash flow of $50 million in the quarter and over $1 billion year-to-date puts us on a trajectory to deliver on our annual guidance which reflects free cash flow in excess of net income and importantly we continue to execute against our strategic capital allocation objectives, first by investing over $800 million across 16 transactions in the first half of the year and second by returning roughly $2.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.","So as Pierre said, we are pleased with our overall results so far this year and we're encouraged by the trends we see in the market and the potential for even stronger growth and momentum in the second half of the year.","With that said, let's get into the details of the quarter starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.2 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.6 billion with a book to bill of 1.1 and outsourcing bookings were $4.6 billion with a book to bill of 1.2. We are very pleased with our bookings, which landed in the range we expected and represents the third highest level of new bookings over the past 10 quarters.","From a business dimension perspective, we were pleased with our bookings in both strategy and consulting services combined and application services. And as you would expect digital, cloud and security related services continued to be an important theme in the work we contracted with our clients. Looking forward, we began the third quarter with a healthy pipeline and we believe we're positioned for continued strong bookings in the second half of the year.","Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $8.32 billion a 5% increase in USD, 6% local currency reflected in our foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2% consistent with the guidance provided last quarter. Our Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.4 billion up 3% in USD and 5% local currency and our outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion up 7% in USD and 8% in local currency. Looking at the trends in estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions, growth was led by operations which posted double-digit growth for the fifth consecutive quarter.","Application Services delivered mid single-digit growth and Strategy and Consulting Services combined grew low single-digits. Once again the dominant driver of our growth was continued strong double-digit growth in The New with all three components going double-digits as well.","Taking a closer look at our operating results, Products our largest operating group led with 15% growth reflecting continued strong momentum in the business. Growth continued to be broad based with strong growth across all geographies and industries. Financial Services grew 8% in the quarter driven by double-digit growth in banking and capital markets globally and overall in both Europe and the growth markets. As expected, banking and capital markets in North America returned to positive growth this quarter.","H&PS came in as expected at 2% growth with positive growth in both Health & Public Service globally and strong overall growth in both Europe and the growth markets. Overall growth in North America was flat. We expect H&PS a to deliver stronger growth in the second half of the year and to deliver full-year growth in the mid-single-digit range consistent with the comments I made in September.","Communications, Media and Technology grew 1% reflecting solid positive growth in North America and double-digit growth in the growth markets partially offset by continued contraction in Europe. From an industry perspective, CMT was led by significant double-digit growth in software and platforms with positive growth in Electronics & High Tech. However, Communications and Media contracted on an overall basis primarily driven by our business in Europe. We expect the revenue growth in our European Communications & Media business will continue to be challenged for the rest of the year.","Finally, Resources revenues decreased 1% in the quarter which is in the range we expected and the storyline remains the same. We continue to see strong growth in utilities which is more than offset by challenges in both Energy and Chemicals and Natural Resources, especially in North America. We expect our Resources group to continue to navigate a challenging environment, but to deliver positive growth in the second half of the year.","Moving now to income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 30.1% compared to 29.8% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% consistent with the same quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 5.9% compared to 5.7% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.1 billion in second quarter reflecting a 13.7% operating margin consistent with quarter two last year.","As a reminder, in the second quarter of last year we closed our Navitaire transaction which lowered our quarter two tax rate by 1.7% and increased net income by $495 million in diluted earnings per share by $0.74. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7% compared with an adjusted tax rate of 15.4% for the same period last year. Net income was $887 million for the second quarter compared with adjusted net income of $805 [ph] million for the same quarter last year.","Our diluted earnings per share were $1.33 compared with adjusted EPS of a $1.34 in the second quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 42 days compared to 44 days last quarter and 39 days in the second quarter of last year.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $50 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $155 million net of property and equipment additions of $104 million. Our cash balance at February 28 was $3.2 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return the cash to shareholders in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 7 million shares for $816 million at an average share price of $117.27 per share. At February 28 we had approximately $4.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","As Pierre just mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.21 per share representing a 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year and this dividend will be paid on May 15, 2017.","So at the halfway point in 2017 we feel good about our results and our positioning to deliver on our full year business outlook, we continue to be laser focused on driving our business to achieve our core financial objectives which include growing faster than the market, delivering modest margin expansion and strong EPS growth, investing at scale for market leadership, and generating strong cash flow which is both invested in the business and return to shareholders through disciplined and smart capital allocation.","With that, let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. Our strong performance in the second quarter and year-to-date demonstrated that we are executing our strategy very well to position Accenture as the leading and most innovative professional services company for the new digital world. With 7% revenue growth in local currency in the first half of the fiscal year, we are clearly growing faster than the market.","This is driven by our accelerated rotations to The New, digital, cloud and security related services which generated revenues of about $8 billion in the first half, more than 45% of total revenues and continue to grow at a strong double-digit rate. And I am particularly pleased that we have achieved these results while continuing to invest for the future in strategic acquisitions, in building assets and solutions and the skills of our people while at the same time returning substantial cash to shoulders.","For Accenture, acquisitions are managing to drive organic growth above the market and we have stepped up our base of acquisitions investing more than $800 million of capital in the first half of the fiscal year. And in the second quarter alone we completed or announced 11 acquisitions to further strengthen our capabilities.","In digital we are acquiring SinnerSchrader, one of the largest digital agencies in Germany. In cloud we acquired solid servision a leading ServiceNow provider. In security we acquired Endgame for the oil services business and announced the acquisition of iDefense and Arismore. Avanade, our majority owned joint venture with Microsoft acquired Infusion [ph] a leading provider of digital transformation services in the Microsoft ecosystem. And we completed three acquisitions that further enhanced our industry deep expertise, Investec Asset Management [ph], [indiscernible] Group Innovation [ph] and Davies Consulting in utilities.","Across Accenture we are leveraging the capabilities we have acquired to bring even more innovation to clients and to drive growth and scale organically. With [indiscernible] which is part of Accenture digital we can with Shell [ph] and Jaguar Land Rover to create the first ever payment system in a car. This new innovation allows drivers to pay at sales stations using an in counter screen and app ultimately delivering a better and more convenient customer experience.","In banking and capital markets our recent acquisitions of InvestTech and Beacon Consulting are further strengthening our asset management capabilities adding deep skills and industry expertise which has enabled us to win new business with top gear asset managers. And in security with the capability of FusionX which we acquired in 2015 we are helping a large international resource company secure millions of daily tractions providing advanced services such as security audit across 15 properties, digital identity management and rigorous testing to prevent cyber attacks.","We also continue to make significant investments in our unique innovation architecture which integrates our capability across research, ventures, labs and studios to pioneer new ways of collaborating with clients to develop and deliver disruptive innovations.","As part of our innovation led approach, we are opening new facilities around the world including several in just the last few months. In Dublin, we open The Dock our new multidisciplinary innovation R&D and incubation hub where all elements of our innovation architecture come to life. The Dock is a launch pad for our more than 200 researchers to innovate with clients and acquisition partners with a particular focus on artificial intelligence.","In Hong Kong, we launched an Accenture Liquid Studio where we are bringing together end-to-end digital customer experience services for clients. In London and Singapore, we opened new Accenture Liquid Studios designed to help clients apply rapid development techniques like Agile methodologies and DevOps to quickly turn concepts into products. And finally in the United States, we are accelerating our innovation investment including 10 new innovation hubs. We just opened our first one in Houston enabling us to collaborate more closely with clients to co-create and scale innovative solutions.","Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, I am going to comment on our result for both the quarter and the first half of the year. In North America, we grew revenues in local currency 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date driven by United States, where we continue to grow ahead of the market. And given our strong market position and pipeline we expect to see stronger growth in North America in the second half of the fiscal year.","In Europe, we continue to grow significantly ahead of the market with 7% revenue growth in local currency for both the quarter and the first half driven primarily by double-digit growth in the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland. We are confident Europe will keep up the strong pace in the second half. And in growth markets we were very pleased with a 9% growth in local currency for the quarter and 10% year-to-date, led once again by very strong double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong growth in China and Australia. We expect growth markets to accelerate its growth in the second half.","Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our talent strategy to lead in The New. The large scale transformation of our business is requiring a very significant investment in our people to ensure they have the most relevant skills to serve our clients both today and in the future. We are proactively training and up scaling thousands of people in key areas such as cloud, artificial intelligence and robotics.","In New IT alone which is all about new architectures, intelligence platforms and automation, we have already trained more than 70,000 people in just over a year. Our approach to continuously investing in the scales and capabilities of our people helps us meet the needs of our clients and enhances our ability to attract the very best talent in our industry. And that is why I'm very proud that Accenture was recently named one of the Fortune\u2019s best companies to work for, for the ninth consecutive year.","So with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David?","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal \u201817 we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.65 billion to $8.90 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 2.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '16 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year '17 based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 2% compared to fiscal '16. For the full fiscal '17, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 6% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16.","Before I continue with our business outlook, as a reminder, in March 2016, we announced the termination of our U.S. pension plan. We expect to record a non-cash charge of approximately $425 million upon final settlement in quarter three 2017. We will provide both GAAP and adjusted quarter three and year-to-date results.","For operating margin on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to be in the range of 22% to 24%. For earnings per share on an adjusted basis and reflecting our updated revenue range, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.87 or 7% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results.","For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in a range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion.","We continue to expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. And finally for the full year, we now expect to invest in the range of $1.5 billion in acquisitions.","With that let's open it up so we can take your questions. Angie?","Angie Park","Thank you, David. I would ask that you please keep to one question and one followup to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Shannon, would you provide instructions for those on the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Hi, good morning Bryan.","Bryan Keane","Hi, good morning David. I just wanted to ask on bookings it came in at $9.2 billion. I know the Street was at $10 billion and $9.2 billion I think is down 3% year-over-year, but it sounds like that was within the range of your expectations. So just trying to gauge was bookings a little bit lighter than you expected or was Street just too aggressive in their assumptions?","And then just secondly on the potential for stronger growth in second half \u201817 may be you can just give us an idea of what that looks like between consulting and outsourcing, in particular consulting slowed a little bit this quarter, but maybe it sounds like it\u2019s going to pick up? Thanks so much.","David Rowland","Yes, so first of all on the bookings \u2013 putting aside the consensus estimate what I had signaled last quarter that we felt confident that bookings would be stronger in the second quarter than the first quarter beginning pattern of building through the year which is typically what we've seen. And so we ended up with about $1 billion more in bookings in the second quarter versus the first quarter that\u2019s consistent with the comments that I made and it's in the range that we expected.","I mean, as you know there is \u2013 you know in any particular quarter there are few deals that can fall on either side of the line, so we will always have kind of a range that we expect to land in and we are very solidly in the range that we expected. And for the full year, we\u2019re very optimistic about our bookings. As I said we began the third quarter second half of the year with a healthy pipeline and we expect to see continued strong bookings in the third and fourth quarter supporting our revenue guidance.","In terms of the growth, but out type of work which I think was the other part of your question is that right?","I guess he has dropped off the line, so for the full year we expect consulting type of work growth to be in the mid to high single digits and we expect outsourcing type of work growth to be in the mid to high single-digits as well. If you look at it by business dimension, which I also comment on, we think strategy and consulting services combined will be in the mid-single digit range.","So we do see an increase in the growth rate of our strategy and consulting services combined in the second half of the year with the application services in the mid-single digit range we see operations in the double-digit range, and of course The New will continue to grow very strong double-digit growth throughout this year.","Bryan Keane","Okay, thanks so much.","David Rowland","All right. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jim Schneider","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if. Hey David, I was wondering may be to followup on a previous question, you delivered pretty good 6% growth this quarter and there was little bit of last quarter came, so I guess, can you maybe talk about, and you talked about the acceleration in the back half of the year. So can you maybe talk about some of the factors that you are seeing that would raise - leave you to not raise your revenue outlook for the full year given the commentary you just made about the back half?","David Rowland","Yes, so let me give a few comments and Pierre will perhaps want to make some comments as well from his perspective. So, let me just start, when we provided full year guidance of 5 to 8 we really entered the year with one possible scenario where the growth in the first half of the year would be relatively speaking, lower than the second half of the year and that scenario in fact is continuing to play out.","As we always say, we started the year, although we had a range of 5 to 8 as we say, working hard each and every day to be at the upper end of the range and that is the, it's still our focus. In terms of what's underneath that, I mean, there's a couple of ways I could kind of help you understand the way we look at the first half versus the second half of the year.","But one way is through the lens of what I have called out as these three concentrated areas of pressure which make up 15% to 18% of our revenue overall. And when you look at those three areas, energy, chemicals, natural resources and communications and media two of those three areas we see and we believe we will see positive growth in the second half of the year relative to where they were in the first half of the year and we have some confidence in that.","Beyond that when you look at the rest of our business, which is growing 10% on a year-to-date basis, even within that we see certain areas of our business that did have positive growth in the first half of the year, but we expect will have even more positive growth in the second half of the year and an industry that comes to mind is health, for example, which has been lower in North America, but we expect will be stronger in the second half of the year, more in kind of the typical growth rates that we expect for health.","So overall, the year is really playing out as we expected. We continue to work hard, to travel land in the upper end of our range as we always do, supporting our confidence level in the second half of the year we narrowed the range to 6 to 8.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, it's hard to be a little bit of additional very well, I mean, to put it very simply we feel very good for the second half of the year. That's it, based on stocks. We have very good bookings, we have good pipeline. We have great momentum in most part of our business, that will give you a clue. We are covering 13 industries. We're big if you well, 13 industries, of these 13 industries 10 are positive and on the 10, six are high single, when I say high single is one is at 9.5, that\u2019s 1 to 10 for simplicity, six would be the double digits.","So you could only be positive when you see such momentum. Indeed, we have three very specific situations, and frankly these three situations at least two are linked to some client situations where indeed the business has been slowing down for absolutely good and valid reasons and we have evidence that the two industries in resources [indiscernible] and energy will be backed in the second half of the year. So I\u2019m extremely positive for the second part of the year.","David Rowland","Okay? Jim thanks.","Jim Schneider","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","David Rowland","Hi, good morning Tien-Tsin, how are you?","Tien-Tsin Huang","I\u2019m good, thanks for taking my question.","David Rowland","Somebody told me you are in Hawaii this morning, so I guess it\u2019s early for you huh?","Tien-Tsin Huang","Its, yes 2:30 not too bad, I\u2019m sitting outside.","David Rowland","Pierre said he appreciates the commitment, you may not\u2026","Tien-Tsin Huang","Well, not too bad sitting outside the wind feels good. Well that's been your loss so that's the good way to take my mind of things and focus on Accenture. I'll ask about, I guess you just talked about the three areas of pressure. Some of them are linked to client situations. I'm curious if you have been able to replenish your pipeline or are you seeing just comps improve or you are actually selling into those existing clients? Just trying to understand how you're able to sort of remix out of the troubled area and then see improvement there does that make sense?","David Rowland","Yes, I would say it\u2019s a combination of the two. I mean, just to be blunt it is a combination of the two. There is a benefit from the comps getting easier and that's just the math, but more importantly, there are really underlying fundamental improvements that we see and the business activity, the dialog that we're having with our clients. The investment and digitization in addition to the kind of the cost rationalization focus that those industries have had for so many quarters now. And so the comps are part of it, but there is some fundamental improvement in the business, a lot of green shoots that we see that I think have a much more optimistic about the trajectory.","Pierre Nanterme","And I would add, if you look at resources, which has been one of the area of watch carefully again that too tough because you are not mentioning utilities. Our utilities business is continued growing double-digits. So this one is on reasonably good fire and we're doing very well, because this industry rotating rapidly to The New and you have a direct correlation in the business with the rotation to The New from our clients and the performance of these industries. This is a simple as this.","And now it is back and I think when I look at the three energy and then you have CNR, chemical and natural resources CNR being the smallest of the three to be clear. And so energy is very important moving forward and we are getting more and more evidence that energy would perform much better in the second part of the year. Yes.","Tien-Tsin Huang","I see, okay just, just let me follow up and just the M&A contribution in the quarter and for the year, it sounds like you upped the spend targets to billion and a half.","David Rowland","Yes, for the full year we continue to expect to be in the range of 2%, but if you peel it back H1 is, let's say closer to 1.5% and H2 would be closer to 2.5% and so in the second half of the year we will see an additional contribution in inorganic relative to H1, but for the full year it will still be in the 2% rang. The additional spend up to$1.5 billion Tien-Tsin, a lot of that will happen in the fourth quarter and the revenue impact of those transactions is much more relevant to FY '18 than it would be FY '17.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Got it. Got it. Thank you so much.","David Rowland","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead with your question.","David Rowland","Good morning David.","David Grossman","Good morning. So I know there's been already several questions about growth, but if you look back consulting growth over the last four years has been pretty lumpy right, 13-14 relatively weak 15 and 16 relatively strong and this year it is falling somewhere in between. And I know we\u2019ve had some fairly significant technology cycles as well as peers had outlined some pretty significant industry cycles impacting growth for the entire industry.","But can you help us think through what the growth in the consulting business should really look like on a normalized basis if there really is such a thing, recognizing that you've got a portfolio and there's always going be pluses and minuses each year?","David Rowland","Yes. I would say on a normalized basis, consulting and strategy services combined would be in the mid-single digit kind of range to let's say high single-digit depending on the cycle that we're in. So it's going to be a mid to high single-digit contributor across our portfolio of businesses.","I mean the consulting growth to be clear as well is connected to this dynamic that we've talked about with our overall growth, meaning that if you look at these three industries that are contracting and primarily because of the cyclical pressures that hasn't had an impact in recent quarters in particular on our consulting and strategy growth rate.","And we think that drag, if you will, that we've seen over the last, let\u2019s take a last few quarters, we will start to mitigate some in the second half of the year. We're also making investments in our consulting business which starts to help drive our growth rate in the second half of the year and beyond as well.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, absolutely, I mean the line, the direction should be mid-to-high single-digit. We believe this is where the consulting business should be. Sometimes they're going to be higher than this because you have a combination of good factors and sometimes you just a bit behind and here we have this combination of these three situations, creating a disproportionate drag on our consulting.","So as we mentioned before, definitely two of the three will get back and so the consulting associated will get back as well. On the other side of the spectrum, we are not only investing in what we call in The New digital, cloud and security, but we, as you know, putting some investments in building extremely deep skills in our yards where we believe there could be higher gross in a very specific way. You've seen the acquisition of [indiscernible] a premium brand in retail North America.","We are doing the same in aviation in very deep skills in investment management where we believe it's going to be a great market and we are making acquisition there on the very targeted basis so, I'm extremely confident that the consulting will be back.","David Grossman","Right. And if I could just ask a quick followup to your comment about rescaling, obviously the pace and breadth of the current cycle has driven the need to rescale at a faster than normal pace. So that aside is it fair to expect after this year that the pace of acquisitions would continue to contribute this 2% rate of growth or would you expect that to come back a little bit as the cycle matures?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I mean we're putting very significant definition on the skills of our people. I mean we just brought 400,000 mark in terms of people and we want to have 400,000 talented people and by talented people, I mean having the right skills this is what we mean by talented people, the right skills for today and more important, the right skill for tomorrow.","So what we did and not starting now, but starting years ago is to make sure that in trading and indication, we are investing significantly. I think the number is public. We are roughly investing $900 million in training and education to make sure that we have the best skilled people and will bode us well to attract the best talent. So we're combining our organic rescaling if you will $900 million we have digitalized all our training to make sure that our cost of training is extremely efficient.","And I would just impress frankly to recognize my friend Bhaskar Ghosh on what he has been doing with our Accenture Technology business in rescaling last year and what we call New IT 70,000 people. He is managing roughly 200,000 people, Bhaskar roughly if I may say. And the goal for us is to scale 100% of these people over three years, 70,000 plus, 70,000 plus, 70,000. In addition, we are recruiting through acquisitions very deep skills, very deep skills, we believe it's going to take too long to grow organic.","And so we have a good, I think a two pronged strategy, if you will, investing in our people to make them relevant and I think this is something we all talk like to our people. We have a responsibility, I feel that way, I have the responsibility to make them relevant for the future and then complement with high notch, iconic talent we\u2019re getting from the market. So we have a kind of perfect blend.","David Grossman","Very good, thank you.","David Rowland","Alright, thank you, David.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","David Rowland","Good morning Ed.","Edward Caso","Good morning. I'm only on the East Coast, so not too bad off here.","David Rowland","We appreciate your commitment as well, thanks a lot.","Edward Caso","Thank you. My question is really around robotics and artificial intelligence from two dimensions. How much are you applying that to your own business to maybe delink the little bit revenue from people growth and how much are you helping your clients and at what pace is it coming on? Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, thanks for the question and in answer to your question number one is extensively and answer to question number two is extensively. I mean what we are especially in Accenture Technology and in Accenture Operations and of course in Accenture Digital, we have now infused in Accenture Technology all new capabilities called for us intelligent platforms. The name we are using, the public name is My Wizard. My Wizard is to first in that category of intelligent platform, so you can develop code using more and more intelligent virtual agents.","So we\u2019re doing that massively, but it's not enough. We\u2019re indeed applying to Accenture Technology, technology delivery centers and more important to Accenture Operations in our BPO centers RPAs, I mean Robotic Process Automations that we are executing for Accenture and it\u2019s interesting to see that many clients are visiting us and considering Accenture of now the benchmark and they are learning from what we do to apply to clients.","So, extensively in Accenture because the name of the game is not labor, is productivity and that's always been the name of the game in Accenture. So, we want to operate at maximum productivity and efficiency with talented people, that's what we have in mind. And as you said, starting to see in some parts of our BPO business, the de-correlation between revenue and labor, and we believe strongly that the combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning, Robotic Process Automation in the coming five years will make a significant difference in this correlation between labor to revenue.","From a client standpoint huge demand. Yes, I've just been pitching RPA and closing RPA deals last week to just to give you so, it's extremely relevant why because you know the clients have generally felt the same as we said I remember in one of our IR day, digitalization and rationalization. Digitalization to create new business model and all the architecture we have been putting in place in The New is resonating with that with Accenture active mobility, analytics, cloud and security and rationalization up, is the art of rationalization for robotics and automation and the demand is just growing and we are very well positioned.","Edward Caso","My other question is on the benefit side of your pension charge, what kind of in basis points contribution to operating margin will that drive in fiscal 2018? Thanks.","David Rowland","It's not material. And I mean in the scheme of Accenture, the benefits that we're deriving from doing this are not that material in terms of the bottom line.","Edward Caso","Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","David Rowland","Good morning David.","David Ridley-Lane","Sure, thank you. Good morning. I did want to maybe touching on that last question, I know you did not manage to gross margin, but the year-to-date gross margin expansion is notable given the longer term trends. Are you seeing the benefit of automation show up there or is this driven more from the revenue mixed shift towards digital? Just trying to get a sense of, is this theme of automation, Robotic Process Automation helping on the gross margin today?","David Rowland","Yes, it is so, most of, by the way, gross margin, let me say that even though gross margin has looked at the last two quarters stayed same, for many reasons we've explained, we really focus more on operating margin. Having so that your question, the big driver I think when you look at the first two quarters has been improvement in our contract profitability. So, our cost to serve clients is one of the bigger major components in our, in our gross margin and we have seen improvements in contract profitability which reflects broadly, some of the improvements we've seen in pricing.","It reflects, there are some mixed shift as we would say we have a higher percentage of higher value kind of added services even higher percentage of those that type of work, which includes digital, but not limited to digital in the mix, et cetera, and as well just the overall efficiency of our payroll structure, which is of course the biggest driver of our cost overall. ","And so it's more about contract profitability and managing our payroll efficiency with a high at a high level of efficiency. Is automation in the mix of our improved contract profitability? It is, but in no way would that be a dominant driver. It's in the mix, but with many other things as well.","David Ridley-Lane","And then just as a quick one, do you see any drag from regulatory uncertainty among your U.S. health insurance clients or maybe said differently, since you expect an acceleration there, what would be the main drivers to get to that?","David Rowland","We did see an impact in the pace of decision making. When you look back now with the, in the rear view mirror, we did see an impact in the pace of decision making and health in North America during the first half of the year.","We believe and we've got fact points, intangible evidence that we would point to that that slower pace of decision making is behind us and that as we've now turned into the new calendar year, we are every month because we're a month into the new administration then the decision making has resumed at normal levels and that's part of the reason why we are more, why we are positive on improved growth rates in the second half of the year. So we did see an impact in the first half of the year. We believe that that's largely behind us. Okay? Thank you, David.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Essex","Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you can maybe dig in a little bit to banking, financial services, you called out North American and Capital Markets mix improving maybe could you, can you provide a little bit of color behind the improvement in that business and what the primary drivers of that improvement might be?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, we I mean all financial services is doing very well. I mean we have been posting I think 8% growth in the\u2026","David Rowland","Yes, banking and capital markets is double-digits.","Pierre Nanterme","Is double digit, yes. So I mean we're doing very well. In North America more specially we're starting to see again more demand in The New. I mean secured and we are working in think you are more diversified portfolio of clients and not only the kind of big category leaders if you will due to the more significant regionalization of our business in the United States where we expect great benefits starting in H2. And in addition as I mentioned especially in investment management, which is part of capital Market we've made a few acquisitions, you've seen Beacon and they are providing as well deep skills.","So again, as in everything it\u2019s a combination of two or three factors you're putting together to create growth and we see some more optimism as well from clients linked to the expected deregulation of some part of their business. So, all of this put together, is creating an environment which is getting better.","Brian Essex","Great, that's very helpful. Maybe as a follow-up could I ask about Accenture Interactive and it seems kind of interesting moves in the press recently there, how big is that business and is that primarily CMT focused or how do you plan to kind of weave that in with your digital aspiration?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I\u2019m extremely pleased with Accenture Interactive and you are giving me the opportunity to recognize the leader of Accenture Interactive and you are giving me the opportunity to recognize the leader of Accenture Interactive Brian Whipple, who is just doing a great job in leading that part of the business. In less than only seven years or something like this we created the largest digital pure player in digital marketing. So the digital agency of Accenture is now one of the largest and a category leader.","We are leading in digital design, especially after the acquisition of [indiscernible] and many other acquisitions. The last one being the Karmarama in the U.K., which is a premium independent, the best independent company in the U.K. Digital production, you remember the acquisition of Aventa [ph] some years ago. Digital commerce which of course is very important on the back of the acquisition of Equity we made in the U.S., some years ago and all what we're doing in terms of customer analytics.","So we were very pleased that last year Ad Age ranked Accenture Interactive number one. And for us it's a very critical milestone. We see more and more clients in detailing from the so called holding companies to Accenture Interactive and our regulatory product we are very close to $6 billion in Accenture Active making us a category leader. So, couldn't be more pleased with Accenture Interactive because, sorry to elaborate a bit I know - I'm passionate about this so, I'm sharing my passion with you.","The business in the future will be more and more driven by experience and design of new capabilities, of new products, of new ways of engaging with the customer, consumer, patients, employees. So, for us it was absolutely critical to put on the top of all services the experience, these design led, experience led, kind of capability and just to give you that\u2019s a point I think we acquired [indiscernible] 150 people roughly, 150, 180 something like this less than 200. Now we're going to crack the 800 people being showed, making certainly sure one of the largest pure player in digital creative design, so that's what we do and we're pleased.","Brian Essex","Well, it is quite a bit larger than we last heard, so it's great to hear, very helpful. Thank you.","Pierre Nanterme","This is what we like to be. I mean we - in our rotation to The New and sorry to be too long about it, in our rotation to The New in interactive mobility edge cloud and security, we want not only to be the number one if you addition this all - this is where we go with our $8 billion in H1 only, but we want to be number one in each of the five. That's what we mean by scaling to lead and this is what we are doing relentlessly.","Angie Park","Shannon, we have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Joe Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.","Joe Foresi","Hello. So I guess, what inning do you think digital might be in and what's the next phase of the digital movement?","David Rowland","It's, I mean I would say that the Digital Wave is still and your baseball analogy I would say it is still in the early innings. I mean it's, there is a, if you talked about in terms of the majority curve, it is low on the majority curve. There is a ways to go.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, early days.","David Rowland","Yes.","Pierre Nanterme","If you look at it and of course some capabilities are more mature than the others and when we're putting that Accenture framework we said we got three ways. I mean the digital consumer and this way you got maturing a lot because I mean you see this is totally where we are doing the majority of Accenture Interactive business of around $6 billion.","Then you have the digital enterprise, how you digitalize all the parts on the enterprise and here the robotics and the automation, will bring a lot, so I think this is coming and then what we are calling digital operations and IOT and this is nascent to be on us and that might be certainly the biggest wave of the three. And so we are positioning Accenture already in what we\u2019re calling industry X.0. We are probably 4.0 as we speak, but that will be 5.0, 6.0 and we\u2019re positioning a lot Accenture of mobility, connected platform, Internet Of Things.","We have already developed many partnerships in the ecosystem with OEM providers to extend our reach to this industrial internet. We have labs. I am thinking about what we have in Bangalore, what we have in Beijing where we are developing very deep industry solutions in the context of the IOT. So it\u2019s early days, I mean it\u2019s going to be a wave for probably a couple of decades.","Joe Foresi","Okay. And then just as a quick followup how is competition in outsourcing particular pricing? Thanks.","David Rowland","I would say \u2013 really no notable change in the competitive landscape in outsourcing if you\u2019re maybe asking specifically about the application maintenance piece of our application services, that continues to be a very, very competitive pricing environment. So that\u2019s more of the same and I would say if you look at BPO and another big piece of outsourcing I would say no notable change.","Pierre Nanterme","So no notable change, but some at Accenture, again because if there is something we hate in our company is commoditization of services. So we\u2019re fighting against commoditization always to move and to rotate to higher value services. The business you\u2019re mentioning is subject to commoditization at great pace.","Our answer to fight against commoditization has been to infuse as I mentioned before through Bhaskar Ghosh and Debbie Polishook leading Accenture technology in our country operations, so a lot of robotics, a lot of automation, less labor arbitrage, more technology, more intelligence. And so indeed, we want to make these activities more tech automated led, less labor intensive like many of our competitors been doing and we are following a very different trajectory.","Joe Foresi","Thanks.","Pierre Nanterme","Okay it\u2019s time to wrap up. Thanks a lot you have been so patient with us. Thanks again for joining us on the call today. As you can tell and have heard from David and I, we are very confident in our ability to deliver another strong year in fiscal year 2017 to continue gaining significant market share as we do. To even further accelerate our rotation to new innovative services and at the same time as we are investing significantly for the future, continuing delivering value for our clients, our people and our shareholders. At the same time, we transform Accenture to be even more successful. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions feel free to call Angie and her team. All the best and talk to you very soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for playback beginning today at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time running through Thursday June 22, 2017 at midnight Eastern.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call will be recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host and facilitator as well as our Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Angie Park. Please go ahead.","Angie Park","Thank you, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I\u2019m Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.","With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.","Let me quickly outline the agenda for today\u2019s call.

As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.","Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, Angie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Accenture had a truly outstanding third quarter. We delivered excellent results from new bookings and revenues to operating margin, EPS and cash flow, and we gained significant market share once again.","The durability of our performance demonstrates the relevance of our growth strategy and our ability to continue delivering strong results and returns for our shareholders, while at the same time investing significantly in new growth opportunities to strengthen our position for the long-term.","Here are a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered record new bookings of $11.7 billion. We grew revenues 11% in local currency to $10.3 billion, and our growth continues to be well-balanced across the dimensions of our business. We delivered earnings per share of $1.79 on an adjusted basis, an 18% increase.","Operating margin was 15.7%, an expansion of 20 basis points on an adjusted basis. We generated very strong free cash flow of $1.8 billion, and we returned approximately $1.6 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend.","So we\u2019re entering the fourth quarter with excellent momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are very well-positioned to deliver our business outlook for the year.","Now, let me hand over to David, who\u2019ll review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you?","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today\u2019s call. As you heard in Pierre\u2019s comments, we\u2019re extremely pleased with our results in the third quarter, which once again, reflect strong momentum across every dimension of our business.","Based on the strength of our third quarter results and the strong confidence and visibility we have in our fourth quarter, we will be increasing key elements of our full-year outlook, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail later in our call. Importantly, both our third quarter results and our updated outlook for the full-year reflect very strong execution against all three financial imperatives for driving superior shareholder value, which I covered in some detail at our Investor Analyst Day in April.","So before I get into the details of the quarter, let me summarize the major headlines of our third quarter results. Net revenue increased more than $1.4 billion, reflecting growth of a 11% local currency and representing the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.","The strong top line growth exceeded our expectations and reflected strong and balanced growth across all operating groups and geographic areas with several growing double digits. The growth continues to significantly outpace the market, reflecting both our leadership position in \"the New\" and the durability of our diverse yet highly focused growth model.","Operating margin of 15.7% expanded 20 basis points, compared to adjusted operating margin last year, consistent with our expectations and reflected strong underlying profitability, which allowed us to invest at scale in our people and our business, and we delivered very strong EPS of $1.79 on an adjusted basis, up 18% over fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS.","And our free cash flow of $1.8 billion reflected both our strong profitability and excellent DSOs. We continue to execute our strategic capital allocation objectives with year-to-date investments of over $450 million in acquisitions and roughly $3.8 billion return to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.","With that said, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $11.7 billion for the quarter, the highest level of new bookings in our history and represents 15% growth in local currency. Consulting bookings were $5.9 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0, and outsourcing bookings were $5.8 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.3.","Our new bookings were extremely well-balanced across the dimensions of our business. Accenture Interactive, Accenture Applied Intelligence, Accenture Industry X.0, as well as Cloud and Security were all important themes and represented roughly 60% of our total new bookings.","Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $10.3 billion, an increase of 16% in USD and a 11% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange tailwind of roughly 5%, compared to the 5.5% impact provided last quarter. This result was approximately $200 million above the upper-end of our FX adjusted range.","Consulting revenues for the quarter were 5.7 billion, up 18% in USD and 12% in local currency, and our outsourcing revenues were $4.6 billion, up 14% in USD and 10% in local currency.","Looking at the trends in estimated revenue growth across our business dimensions, the overrunning theme was strong and balanced growth across all business dimensions. We saw an uptick in Strategy and Consulting Services, which grew high-single digits, while both Application Services and Operations posted double-digit growth. And \u201cthe New\u201d including Digital Cloud and Security, continued to deliver very strong double-digit growth, reflecting many of the market themes and key points of differentiation, which we discussed at our Investor Analyst Day.","I\u2019d like to also highlight the strong demand for Intelligent Platform Services, which continued to be an important contributor to our growth. As you know, Intelligent Platform Services brings together our industry, functional and next-generation application capabilities powered by our innovation architecture to drive mission-critical programs for our clients, and these services primarily relate to deploying next-generation technologies in SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Workday.","Taking a closer look at our operating groups, Communications, Media, & Technology led all operating groups with 18% in local currency, reflecting continued strong momentum in many parts of the business, especially Software and Platforms and Communication and Media, which both posted double-digit growth, as well as double-digit growth across all three geographies.","Resources grew 12% in the quarter, driven by strong double-digit growth in Energy and Chemicals and Natural Resources. We continue to see strong demand for our services across all geographies with double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets and strong growth in Europe.","Products delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with 11% growth in the quarter, led by Industrial and Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services. Growth was strong across all geographies with double-digit growth in both Europe and the growth markets.","Financial services grew 8% in local currency, reflecting strong growth in both banking and capital markets and insurance. Growth was strong across all three geographies led by double-digit growth in the growth markets.","And finally, H&PS grew 7%, driven by double-digit growth in public service. We continue to be pleased with double-digit growth in Europe and the growth markets and solid growth in North America.","Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%, compared to 32.8% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7%, compared to a 11.1% for the third quarter last year, and our general and administrative expense was 5.7%, compared to 6.2% for the same quarter last year. We have two items impacting metrics this quarter.","As a reminder, in quarter three last year, we recorded a settlement charge related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan. In this quarter, we recorded charges of $102 \u2013 $122 million related to tax law changes, which increased our quarter three tax rate by 7.6% and decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19. The following comparisons exclude those impacts were applicable and reflect adjusted results.","Operating income was $1.6 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.7% operating margin, an increase of 20 basis points, compared to op \u2013 adjusted operating margin in quarter three last year.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.8%, compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.6% for the third quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.79, compared to an adjusted EPS of $1.52 in the third quarter last year, and this reflects an 18% increase over last year\u2019s result. Day services outstanding were 39 days, compared to 40 days last quarter and 41 days in the third quarter of last year.","Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.8 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $174 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $3.9 billion, compared with $4.1 billion at August 31.","With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.7 million shares for $720 million at an average share price of $153.60 per share. At May 31, we had approximately $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 15, 2018, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal 2018 in the amount of $1.33 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.7 billion.","So in summary, we\u2019re extremely pleased with our outstanding third quarter results and now focused on quarter four and closing out a strong year.","Now let me turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you, David. At our Investor and Analyst Conference in April, we provided an update on our strategy of building differentiated capabilities for the digital world, applying innovation at scale and ensuring that we anticipate the impact of the next waves of technology disruption for our clients.","Our excellent results for the third quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute this strategy very well. The end-to-end capabilities we have built at scale and in an industry context are unique in the marketplace. Our ability to integrate these services from strategy and consulting to digital, technology, operations and cybersecurity enables us to deliver targeted business outcomes for clients.","Our rapid rotation to \u201cthe New\u201d digital, cloud and security, continues to drive significant growth for Accenture. Revenues in \u201cthe New\u201d, again grew at a very strong double-digit rate in the third quarter and accounted for about 60% of total revenues for the first time, highlighting that \u201cthe New\u2019 has now become the core of our business.","Digital transformation is now a clear imperative for our clients, and we are uniquely positioned to deploy digital services end-to-end at scale across industries and geographies. With Accenture Applied Intelligence, we are bringing together our capabilities in data, analytics and artificial intelligence, combined with our deep understanding of industries and business functions to help clients reimagine their core processes.","With Bepensa, a Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico, we are leveraging the Accenture Insights Platform to mine the data from 2 billion transactions a year to provide a holistic view of the business, better service 300,000 daily customers and significantly increased market share.","We\u2019re also gaining significant traction with Accenture Industry X.O, where we are reinventing manufacturing with smart connected products and services using advanced technologies, including the Internet of Things, connected devices and digital platforms. We are helping BSA Group, the Italian manufacturer, expand beyond products into digital services.","BSA is rolling out connected services ranging from management alerts to in-depth analytics across its installed base of 20,000 industrial machines, driving new revenue streams, as well as significant cost savings. And we continue to build our Industry X.O capabilities. This month, we announced our agreement to acquire designaffairs, a design firm based in Germany that specializes in smart products and services for manufacturers. It complements very well our acquisition of Mackevision in the second quarter.","Accenture also remained the partner of choice for the world\u2019s leading companies on large-scale, mission-critical transformation programs. And our ability to mobilize and integrate end-to-end services to deliver value and business outcomes is clearly setting us apart in the marketplace.","We are helping DowDuPont with the post-merger integration of Dow Chemical and Dupont, as well as preparations for their planned spin-offs. We have expanding the scope of our services to include substantial work in digital, strategy and management consulting, with the goal of enabling each of the future companies with the distinctive capabilities needed to lead in their respective markets.","Turning now to the geographic dimension of our business. I\u2019m just very pleased that we again delivered strong growth in the third quarter across all three of our geographic regions with double-digit growth in most of our major markets.","Starting in North America, we delivered 11% growth, driven by further acceleration in the United States. In Europe, revenues grew 9% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in Germany, Italy, Ireland, France and Spain. And in growth market, I\u2019m delighted that we delivered another exceptional quarter with 17% growth in local currency, led once again by very strong double-digit growth in Japan, as well as double-digit growth in Australia, Brazil and Singapore.","Before I hand back to David, I want to take a moment to touch on Accenture\u2019s role in helping to solve important societal challenges. Trust and responsibility are increasingly critical in evaluating companies as a potential partner, employer or investment. And at Accenture, we feel a responsibility to encourage the use of emerging technologies as a positive force for the economy and the broader society.","For example, we are using blockchain and value metrics to support ID2020, which is helping to solve the challenges of identity faced by more than 1.1 billion people around the world. In Japan, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a revolutionary system to dispatch emergency vehicles more quickly ultimately saving lives.","And I\u2019m particularly proud of the work our people do across the Accenture Labs in Bangalore, Dublin, San Francisco and Sophia Antipolis to use cutting-edge technologies in innovative ways through our Tech4Good initiative like AI smartphone solution that helps the blind navigate the world and lead more productive lives. Creating innovative solutions that improve the way the world walks and leaves is our mission at Accenture and quite simply the right thing to do.","With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, again, over to you?","David Rowland","Thank you, Pierre. So let me now turn to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect net revenues to be in the range of $9.8 billion to 10.05 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and reflects an estimated 7% to 10% growth in local currency.","For the full fiscal year 2018, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollar will be positive 3% compared to fiscal 2017. For the full fiscal 2018, we now expect our net revenues to be in the range of 9.5% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal 2017.","For operating margin, we continue to expect full fiscal 2018 to be 14.8% consistent with adjusted fiscal 2017 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%. The increase in our guidance from last quarter is primarily due to the $122 million tax charge that I mentioned earlier. The charge includes two components, an additional $41 million provisional charge related to the adoption of the U.S. Tax Act, as well as an $81 million expense from a non-U.S. tax law change.","Excluding the impact of these tax law changes, we now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. For earnings per share, we now expect our diluted EPS for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $6.26 to $6.31. Excluding the impact of tax law changes, we now expect adjusted full-year diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.66 to $6.71, or 13% to 14% growth over adjusted fiscal 2017 results.","For the full fiscal 2018, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion.","Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases and continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 1%, as we remain committed to returning the substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s open it up, so we can take your questions. Angie?","Angie Park","Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and the follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Steve, would you provide instructions for those on the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come \u2013 our first question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, good morning, guys. How are you?","David Rowland","Good morning, Jason. How are you?","Jason Kupferberg","Good, good, good, thanks. Great set of constant currency results here obviously. So we\u2019re just continuing to get lot of questions around FX just given some of the recent moves. I wanted to just get some of your initial thoughts. If FX spot rates today or in recent weeks were to in theory hold going forward, how should we think about the potential FX headwind to revenue and EPS next year just so we can start to get our models calibrated?","David Rowland","Yes, this will be the only comment I\u2019ll make relative to next year quantitatively by the way, but I don\u2019t mind saying this, because it\u2019s just really an extrapolation of the math. As we do our analysis, so looking at the rates that we used as a basis for the FX impact that I just provided for this year, if those rates were to hold constant as we do our analysis, it would create a headwind of about 2%, so it will have a negative 2% impact on our results next year.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, both top and bottom line?","David Rowland","Yes, both.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay.","David Rowland","Essentially, yes.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, great. So just as my follow up, obviously, really good to see the constant currency top line raise for this year. Is most all of that organic, and I know you did announce a couple of additional acquisitions since the last earnings call, but it didn\u2019t seem like there would be enough time left in this year for them to contribute much. So are we still thinking kind of 2.5%-ish for M&A contribution in fiscal 2018?","David Rowland","Yes. The beat, if you will, in quarter three was 100% organic. And therefore, that\u2019s the basis for us raising our guidance for the year. There\u2019s no change in our view on inorganic for the full year. We still think we\u2019ll end the full year with it making about a 2.5% contribution, and against that 2.5% contribution for the year, it was a little higher than that in the first half of the year to a little lower than that in the second half of the year and averages to about 2.5% for the year.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Well, nice job. Thanks for the comments.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, good morning.","David Rowland","Hey, good morning, Tien-tsin.","Tien-tsin Huang","Good morning, good morning, good revenue acceleration here. So just on the revenue front, I\u2019ll ask if there are any callouts on what surprised you, perhaps strategy consulting, accelerating. Just curious what drove the let\u2019s say, the \u2013 I think you said $200 million above the FX-adjusted range to the top line of the guide?","David Rowland","Yes, the good news is that the additional revenue was really broad-based. Literally, every operating group delivered above their expectations. As you might guess, the strongest over-delivery came from the three operating groups with the double-digit growth.","So CMT, Products and Resources were the biggest contributor to the strong revenue performance. As you also alluded to and I called out in my script, strategy and consulting combined was also quite strong at high-single digits, and we were very pleased with that, but it was really the over-delivery from a top line standpoint was broad-based. And I think it aligns with the fact that we had such strong, broad-based, record-setting new bookings that underpinned that and just reflective of the strong momentum in the market overall.","Tien-tsin Huang","Sure, good.","David Rowland","Yes.","Tien-tsin Huang","So my follow-up quickly is just on the outsourcing booking that 1.3x book-to-bill, I believe.","David Rowland","Yes.","Tien-tsin Huang","So what\u2019s the \u2013 are larger deals back? Just curious if there is anything chunky that, that contributed to that or if there\u2019s anything unusual?","David Rowland","Yes, we did have \u2013 we had some large, I mean, as you would expect, we had some larger deals in there. We had a couple of, in particular, larger deals. I think the total number of deals are more than $100 million, I didn\u2019t say it, but it was \u2013 I think it was 12. If I\u2019m remembering that correctly, and so that is in the zone probably in the high end of what we see in a typical quarter.","I don\u2019t know that big deals are back necessarily, because we\u2019ve always had a good flow of big deals, but as we look at our pipeline going forward, what we call our mega pipeline actually looks really good. And actually, I\u2019m being told that we had 13 deals over $100 million, not 12, so, yes.","Tien-tsin Huang","Off by one. ","David Rowland","Yes.","Tien-tsin Huang","It\u2019s in the zone. Thank you, sir.","David Rowland","All right. Thank you, Tien-tsin.","Operator","Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Bryan Bergin","Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the headcount growth versus revenue growth. Can you comment on whether you\u2019re seeing any change in the inflection of the resource requirements that you need for this high level of growth due to better automation traction of the Platform business. And then can you just give us some color on the pickup in attrition?","David Rowland","Yes. So our headcount growth did grow at a pace below our revenue growth, and we have seen that several quarters if you look over the last eight quarters or so. Certainly, there\u2019s the potential for that trend to be more common as we look forward both as it relates to the productivity efficiencies that we will drive into the business, including through technology and as well we are always constantly focused on pricing improvement and increasing the revenue yield per head in our revenue.","And so, it is \u2013 it\u2019s a part of our strategy of extracting more value from our business for our shareholders and our employees, and in a perfect world, we would see a higher revenue yield per head going forward, and our challenge is to achieve that through the mix of our services, the pricing, et cetera.","On the attrition front, there\u2019s not anything we\u2019re particularly concerned about. The attrition did tick up, but we feel very good about our ability to attract the talent in the marketplace that we need. We are an employer of choice certainly in our sector. We have no issues recruiting the people that we need in the market, and we also are quite pleased with our overall retention, including retention of critical skills even with what was a slight tick up in overall attrition. So we don\u2019t have any particular concerns there.","Bryan Bergin","Okay, thanks. And then on the H&PS segment, have you seen improvement in those healthcare contracts that you cited last quarter, anything around the contract profitability? Thank you.","David Rowland","Yes, very pleased with the H&PS profitability as we were all the operating groups. Every single operating group if you look at this concept of underlying profitability that we talk about sometimes at the Accenture level, which is the underlying profitability above and beyond our reported profitability that \u2013 where we use the headroom to invest in our people and our business.","Every single one of our operating groups had a really strong improvement in underlying profitability. Now underneath that, they had investments, et cetera, that are reflected in the operating margin numbers that, that we report. But we were quite pleased with all of our operating groups and H&PS included, which did show sequential improvement in profitability, and that is as we expected and as we signaled in the first-half of the year.","Bryan Bergin","Thanks.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group, please go ahead.","Pierre Nanterme","Good morning, Jamie.","Jamie Friedman","Hi, thank you. Hey good morning, guys. Good set of results here. Sorry if I don\u2019t have the greatest connection. But, David, I wanted to ask in your prepared remarks, I thought you said something that was new, at least, new to me, We decomposed the bookings, it was the Industry X.O and Interactive, I thought you said 60%. If you wouldn\u2019t mind just repeating that if you have that there, that would be helpful?","David Rowland","Yes. And there was a subtle change, and frankly, the intent was to \u2013 we talk about \u201cthe New\u201d so much that I was just taking the opportunity to remind people what the components of \u201cthe New\u201d. So I called out the five components by name. And the only intent was to again remind the components of \u201cthe New\u201d, especially as we have changed some of the terminology as we\u2019ve evolved digital to talk about Accenture Interactive, Accenture Applied Intelligence and Accenture Industry X.O.","And \u201cthe New\u201d overall, so those five components in aggregate represented about 60% of our total bookings and that\u2019s consistent with the comments that Pierre made where from a revenue standpoint, \u201cthe New\u201d represents approximately 60% of our revenues at this point as well.","Pierre Nanterme","Maybe I can jump on this one, because nobody is asking me any questions. They\u2019re all for you, David, so I\u2019m jumping on it. You mentioned that we had evolved the terminology but, of course, it\u2019s more than the terminology. And the reality is that we\u2019re constantly evolving the content of our capabilities in \u201cthe New\u201d.","Accenture Interactive has been there since day one, no change. We continue growing, developing and scaling. We had Accenture Mobility around enterprise apps and connected platform. We evolved now to Industry X.O to build a capability totally focused on smart and digital manufacturing.","Same thing we\u2019ve been doing with Accenture Analytics. We started with \u2013 we upgraded this year to Accenture Applied Intelligence by adding on top of the analytics, machine learning and applied intelligence. So it\u2019s important for all of you to understand that almost every year or every couple of years, we will always significantly improve, upgrade, what we\u2019re calling \u201cthe New\u201d to make sure we are always ahead of the curve and bringing innovation at the heart of our existing capabilities.","Jamie Friedman","Thanks, Pierre. And then I did have one for you, Pierre, which was with regard to the growth and Strategy Consulting and Application Services, do you \u2013 is it fair to think of those as lead indicators for the company, or would that be an exaggeration?","Pierre Nanterme","No, I think for us, it\u2019s important with range, strategy, management consulting and intelligent platform, so the added value part of our system integration, because it\u2019s demonstrating that what we\u2019re selling is highly differentiated is more at the high-end of the value chain of our services. And of course, it is important in the context of contributing to our margin and \u2013 to our margin and ultimately, profitability.","So I\u2019m very pleased that we moved Strategy Consulting to high single digits. I think this is a good place to be and it\u2019s the demonstration that our services are more and more differentiated with that piece, which is clearly around industry specific solutions and very cutting-edge consulting work, same with Application Services. The system integration piece is on fire right, and especially with what we\u2019re calling the intelligent platforms.","So all this new digital artificial intelligence, analytic or rich platforms, where we are leading with all of them to be honest in the marketplace and again, it\u2019s a significant contributor to our rotation to \u201cthe New\u201d. So it\u2019s a sign of good health. You\u2019re absolutely right.","Jamie Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Rowland","Hey, good morning, Jim.","Jim Schneider","Hey, good morning, David. Just a question on the CMT, that continues to be very, very strong there. Their growth, I think accelerated even further. Can you maybe give us a sense about what the components of that growth are and what kind of work you\u2019re seeing there that maybe you didn\u2019t see a year or two ago? Is there anything kind of increment on that front?","Pierre Nanterme","Yes, I\u2019ll sort of take this one.","David Rowland","Go head. Go ahead, please.","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, CMT, we talked a lot about CMT these last years. Needless to say, it\u2019s a set of industries on the massive transformation. If you take the different components, high-tech, telecom and what we\u2019re calling software and platforms. Software and platforms are the driving force of the growth in terms of CMT, because these companies are investing massively in the context of leading in the market.","So here, the business is to support the leaders providing, I mean, you know well the names, the leading platforms in the marketplace. So we\u2019re supporting them and supporting their growth and we are the enabler of that growth.","On the other side of the spectrum, you will find telecom. Telecom is small transformation. These companies are facing significant challenges and you know now they\u2019re on path [ph]into massive M&A consolidation and so a lot happening, including they\u2019re all launching new networks. Yes, we\u2019re moving from web. We\u2019re moving from \u2013 we\u2019ve been moving from the three to the fourth to the fifth GB. You put the cyber on top of it, so they need to continue investing and again, they need people like us to support their transformation, as well as being an enabler of their network implementation.","And then in-between, you have the high-tech and high-tech companies again are not only CMT companies, but they are enablers of many industries in providing the equipment, providing the technology. And I\u2019m extremely pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in high-tech across the Board, especially with some recent excellent progress we have made with aerospace and defense, where we decided to focus on as a very promising industry. And with the focus we put as an illustration on this industry, it\u2019s as well a good contributor to our overall growth.","So three different segments with three different set of issues, but we are the enabler of their change, their transformation and ultimately, their leadership in the marketplace.","Jim Schneider","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just regarding the tax rate, David, I know you said you won\u2019t talk about fiscal 2019. But can you maybe just talk about your overall tax rate or sort of your overall tax planning, how that\u2019s evolved over the last few quarters or so and whether you think that there\u2019s any kind of change to what you previously said about the tax rate on go-forward basis, given all that context?","David Rowland","Yes. So first \u2013 I mean, first of all, the \u2013 it goes without saying that the tax environment continues to be highly complex and fluid, if not even volatile perhaps. And so it is a significant effort with a lot of talented people that stay on top of our tax planning and all of the math \u2013 matters and policy progression and all the tax jurisdictions around the world.","You\u2019re right, I\u2019m not going to comment on FY 2019 beyond what I have said previously. I would prefer that we just give one update in September when we provide guidance. There\u2019s basically two statements that I\u2019ve made or that we\u2019ve disclosed just to remind you. So one thing that we disclosed and I commented on is the accounting change on income tax effects of intercompany transfers, the ASU 2016-16. And we disclosed that in isolation that would have about a 3.5% impact on our tax rate. And so that\u2019s one item that we called out, which is in our future.","Now that impact would be in isolation. And obviously, there are other elements of our tax planning that we\u2019re constantly working on. And so that\u2019s not to imply necessarily that, that would be the ultimate impact, but that item alone will have that impact. And, of course, the other item that we called out obviously is the U.S. tax reform. And previously, we had said that, that would have a modest \u2013 create modest upward pressure on our tax rate. And so those are really among a longer list of items that we\u2019re focused on. Those are the two things that we\u2019ve talked about the most and that we\u2019ve had disclosures on.","Jim Schneider","Thank you.","David Rowland","Thank you.","Operator","Harshita Rawat of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Harshita Rawat","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, Pierre, it does appear that we are in one of the strongest enterprise IT demand environment in many years. And do you have a sense of whether this is cyclical and tax reform-related update, or is there more \u2013 is this more structural in nature, because IT is again sort of perceived to be an investment area versus a budget that needs to be managed?","Pierre Nanterme","I tend to believe it\u2019s more a structural than something, which is more cyclical on the short-term and for many reasons. I mean, first, it\u2019s incredibly pervasive across all the industries. So when you look at our rotation to \u201cthe New\u201d, it\u2019s amazingly consistent across all our industries, whatever you\u2019re taking the B2C and now the B2B. The same thing, it\u2019s amazingly consistent across the world.","When you look at the rotation to \u201cthe New\u201d from the U.S. to Europe to Brazil, Australia and Japan, you see the same level of demand across the world. So it\u2019s something, which is extremely significant. Next, when you look at this IT revolution, and let\u2019s call that digital revolution, it\u2019s coming through waves. So it\u2019s got one thing. It is now a continuous flow of new technologies coming one of the other to change the game. So we started with some basic Internet technology solutions more on the B2C. Now we\u2019re moving to look at it everything connected. If you look at this, that would be a big market in itself.","So what we\u2019re calling the Internet of Things, but everything connected then you move to the artificial intelligence at large. And everybody would believe we are more at the very beginning of this wave than anything else. Then the blockchain we talked in last three years and we incubated, now it\u2019s starting to pickup.","And by the way, we\u2019ve put all act together. We have made significant investments, and now we\u2019re taking the position of leader in this blockchain technologies. And it\u2019s not enough, you\u2019re moving to immersive realities, virtual realities, and then you have \u201cthe New\u201d IT. The new ways of developing system, dev ops, agile. And then I can continue with quantum computing.","So look at the series of incredible digital disrupt \u2013 technology disruptions, where in the past probably you would have one for 40 years. Now you have one every 18 months. So I tend to believe that we are in a true force revolution \u2013 industrial revolution based on digital and it\u2019s something, which going to be more secular than cyclical.","Harshita Rawat","Great, thank you. And just as a follow-up, again, this context of this growing IT demand environment. Is there any change in your thinking about your continued ability to hire and retain talent in this tightening labor market?","Pierre Nanterme","We have no issues, I mean, to make it. I know that the \u2013 I mean, the data when you look at this and you take a bit your microscope, you will see some pickup in the attrition, but we are in the zone, as David said, I mean rightfully. The reality is, are we able to attract the best talent in the marketplace, sometime we\u2019re calling them iconic talent from the outside? The answer is, yes. Are we retaining our best Managing Directors? We have and we have now 7,000 Managing Directors. The level of attrition is incredibly low in the ranks of Managing Directors.","Everyday, we have people willing to join Accenture. So \u2013 and finally, our brand is attractive and the brand is attractive because of the success of the rotation to \u201cthe New\u201d and the pivot we\u2019ve been executed to be now perceived and it\u2019s not a perception, it\u2019s the reality as a highly innovative company accommodating multiple cultures in the same company from designers to business scientists to the more classic programmers and developers. And to people extraordinary knowledgeable in leading and cutting-edge IT, plus all the effort we made to make the Accenture what we\u2019re calling, Truly Human, Tech4Good what I mentioned in my script.","All of this is creating an environment, which I tend to believe is Accenture is very attractive. Evidence is recently we won many awards in term of the best place to work most attractive place to work. And I\u2019m very pleased as you\u2019re giving me the opportunity to mention that that we\u2019re not only the best place to work for everybody, but as well with a great sense of diversity in it.","So we have received many recognition for women for LGBT. And I\u2019m extremely pleased that we are attractive for everybody as we should. All the talent, all the background, all the different best gender, and all the diversity, and we have a good brand supporting that.","Harshita Rawat","Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","Pierre Nanterme","Thank you.","Operator","Rod Bourgeois of DeepDive Equity. Please go ahead.","Pierre Nanterme","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Bourgeois","Hey, good morning. Good to talk to you, guys. Hey, within the Intelligent Platforms business where you work on ERP systems. Can you talk about, which ERP platforms are contributing the most to your growth? And also perhaps the software market trends that are catalyzing your demand and that ERP services space?","Pierre Nanterme","I mean, as you know, Rod, we\u2019re walking with all the usual suspects from the platform standpoint. So I would mention the names you all know in the leading platform from SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Salesforce.com, Workday, to mention maybe the names everybody would know. All of these platform and software provider did their rotation to \u201cthe New\u201d.","So the one that were not in the cloud are now in the cloud. And all of them as they have added features in term of analytics and in term of artificial intelligence insight. That\u2019s why now we\u2019re calling them at Accenture Intelligent Platforms, because they are not any more the old ERP we knew. They are ERP in the cloud for which in term of new functionalities, analytics and the artificial intelligence.","So this market has been very good for Accenture. We\u2019ve been driving excellent growth from our, let\u2019s call, that the ERP business or Intelligent Platform business. We are \u2013 I mean, we are again the partner of choice. And the market is vibrant as well, because many clients been waiting for the new platforms to arrive, to upgrade and move. And I believe we\u2019re more again at the beginning of this wave of replacing the old ERP with the new one, because it\u2019s going to drive lot of benefits in terms of again of leveraging the cloud, leveraging analytics, and leveraging artificial intelligence.","So we have a very strong position. We organize our capabilities in our operating group as well in Accenture technology to have at scale capability to support all these leading platforms and we are getting a very good return.","Rod Bourgeois","That\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Can you give any color on the relative contributions of the components of New to your overall growth? I\u2019m particularly interested in your view on which component in \u201cthe New\u201d has the most future potential to evolve with success akin to the Accenture interactive business. So as an example, is IoT, the best candidate for future growth potential, or is something else catching your attention there?","Pierre Nanterme","I would say, all our new babies have the potential to grow successfully for many years. Now in the family, some are already operating at scale grown-up, I mean, you mentioned Accenture Interactive. Now three years in a row, number one in advertising age as the fastest growing and largest digital experience agency. By the way, I\u2019m pleased that you give me the opportunity to mention to the whole group that we won seven awards at the Cannes Lions with an acquisition we made in Dublin with a company called Rothco.","So we are in the interactive game big time. We are winning not only awards, but as well big clients. So with Accenture Interactive, it\u2019s scaled to lead, if you will. It\u2019s more mature than the others. Next, I would mention certainly, cloud as well is more scaled to lead. So these two are scaled to lead. That Applied Intelligence is as well at a very significant scale, but the name of the game for us is to infuse the latest cutting-edge artificial and algorithmic technologies in that unit we\u2019re calling Applied Intelligence. And then we have two with a big potential to grow, because they are not yet operating at the same scale.","I\u2019m thinking about Accenture Security, where we have put together all our cybersecurity capabilities and it\u2019s growing, David would say, strong double-digit that would probably add hyper-strong double digits just to give you a sense of \u2013 it\u2019s a bit more than strong double-digit. And the last one we launched with industry X.0 I mentioned, which is all the digital applied to manufacturing.","This is clearly for us a significant investments we\u2019re going to make this year and in the coming three years, because it\u2019s all about replicating to the B2B industries the success we have with the B2C. And we\u2019re making good progress and I\u2019m pleased. And more to come, because every year, we\u2019re going to launch new capabilities in \u201cthe New\u201d when they will mature.","Rod Bourgeois","It sounds like you don\u2019t have a favorite baby, you have all of them.","Pierre Nanterme","This is the way we are in France, we we love all of them.","Rod Bourgeois","Thank you, guys.","David Rowland","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Yes. Hi, guys. Congrats on very solid results here. Just want to follow-up on the and the strength in the bookings. Was that a lot of renewals in there, or is that new business that pushed that higher? And then just thinking about the pipeline now, does it become a little more depleted since you had such a big quarter this quarter?","David Rowland","Yes. So there \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s a lot of new business in the $11 billion-ish, $11 billion-plus bookings, $11.7 billion in the quarter. I mean, you don\u2019t get to that number with, let\u2019s say, a disproportionate or unusual level of renewals. And the other part of the question was pipeline. Yes, I mean, any time we have a bookings quarter that large then, I mean, obviously, it has some impact on the pipeline.","But having said that, we have had a lot of replenishment even during the quarter, so we feel good about our pipeline. But yet, as you can imagine, we\u2019re very focused on our pipeline replenishment as we think about turning the page into fiscal 2019 and, let\u2019s say, the next challenge of growth. So we always have work to do on our pipeline. We feel good about it, but we\u2019re always focused on expanding that.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then just want to follow-up on the fourth quarter revenue guidance. I know top line was strong in a 11% constant currency this quarter. I think, the guidance imply some like 7% to 10% constant currency for the fourth quarter, which is a tad below the strength of this quarter. Just thinking about that growth considering the strong bookings, is that just a little bit of conservatism built in there, or another possibility is some of the M&A business has fallen off that\u2019s causing a little lower growth rate than we saw in the third? Thanks so much.","David Rowland","Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s conservatism, 11% growth is really outstanding and as well the upper-end of our range at 10% growth is also outstanding. And so, as we always say, we have a 3 point range. You never like the bottom part of the range and, of course, we\u2019re always focused on being as high in the range as we possibly can. And to the extent, we were to deliver at the upper-end of the range. We would continue to gain massive share in the marketplace.","I mean, that level of growth would be outstanding and we would be very pleased with that at the upper-end of the range. So, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s not the intent to be conservative. There\u2019s the intent to have a reasonable range. And again, the upper half of the ranges is quite strong.","Bryan Keane","Okay, great. Thanks.","Angie Park","Hey, Steve, we have time for one more question and then Pierre will wrap up the call.","Operator","Okay. Our last question will come from the line of Brian Essex, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Brian Essex","Great, thank you for taking the question.","David Rowland","Hey, Brian.","Brian Essex","Pierre, how are you. Yes, I was just wondering if maybe you can unpack the digital a little bit. I get a lot of questions in terms of what\u2019s maybe migrational in nature and Pierre did a great job kind of differentiating ERP part of the equation. We\u2019ve also had some great stories on truly transformational digital projects.","I think, Pierre had one in this prepared remarks. I know on the operational side, your operations team has some great supply chain examples, particular in the beverage market. How much of the digital would you say is truly transformational versus more kind of migrational in nature where you\u2019re just taking an application and putting into new operating environment?","Pierre Nanterme","It\u2019s getting more and more transformational. I mean, you\u2019re right. I mean, the first waves, you\u2019ll always fight to catch the low-hanging fruit that\u2019s going that way. And the low-hanging fruit, for instance, would be I\u2019m taking my current applications, no change, no transformation and I move them to the cloud just to benefit from the cost difference with a classic infrastructure, what you\u2019re calling the migration.","So we\u2019ve seen some of the journey to the cloud. You\u2019re taking the existing, you lift and and brought to the cloud, and you\u2019re making the benefits. You still have some of this work, of course. But what I find and I found very interesting is, indeed, the market is shifting at these results and our clients to using digital as more transformational.","For instance, when you move or change from the existing ERP to a new ERP in the cloud and then you\u2019re using the Analytics and Applied \u2013 and the Artificial Intelligence features in order to drive more value in the company in term of forecasting, for instance, or other activity then it is more transformational.","As we speak, we\u2019re working in some very large organization in CMT. Again, in the context of aerospace and defense to deploy these new digital platforms from engineering services to production to cross-sell end-to-end with 3D features in it and so forth. It\u2019s truly transformational and it\u2019s not just the low-hanging fruit, simple migration.","So we see more and more now as the market is maturing. And as the leaders are understanding better the core of the digital transformation, the shift from simple migration to drive the easy cost to a more profound digital transformation to win the big prize. So from the low-hanging fruit to the big prize, this is the difference with the migration to the transformation. We see more of those.","Brian Essex","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And one quick follow-up for David. David, I think last quarter, you said you might come in a tick under $1 billion for M&A. You still have that outlook, or is it that change at all for the remainder of the year?","David Rowland","Yes, it is \u2013 our current view is that we\u2019ll land somewhere in the range of $650 million to $750 million of invested capital. We\u2019re fine with that. We\u2019re not in the business of just trying to do deals for the sake of doing deals, we want to do the right deals. And so that\u2019s going to be the level that we\u2019re going to be at this year, but we are committed to that being an important part of our strategy going forward.","And as we\u2019ve said, up to 25% of our operating cash flow is our strategic capital allocation model objective. We always have an active pipeline and that\u2019s true today. And so, it\u2019s something that we continue to focus on as an important part of our strategy.","Brian Essex","Super helpful. Thank you for squeezing me in.","David Rowland","Right. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to our host and panelists for any closing remarks.","Pierre Nanterme","Yes. I mean, thanks a lot again to all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call. In closing and I\u2019m sure you heard that throughout the call, we and I feel very good about where we are. We feel confident in our ability to finish the year strong. We believe that with the highly differentiated capability, we have built in \u201cthe New\u201d, our continued investment across Accenture and the disciplined management of our business.","We are extremely well-positioned to continue driving profitable growth and delivering value for our clients, our people and our shareholders. We look forward to looking with you again next quarter. And in the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Angie and the team. All the best and thanks, again, for joining and supporting Accenture.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude our conference call for today. On behalf of today\u2019s panel, we\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in today\u2019s earnings call and thank you for using our service. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect."]}}
