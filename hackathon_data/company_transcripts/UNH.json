Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Here are important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. ","A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investor page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 17, 2017 which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the Company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning and thank you for joining us. We plan to keep our prepared remarks brief today. Just a month and a half ago, we held our annual investor conference and fourth quarter results are very much in line with or slightly stronger than we discussed at the conference. So our focus is now well in to 2017. ","We ended the year with modestly stronger than expected growth across our businesses, and as the story has been throughout the year, customer retention and expanding relationships played a central role at our member and revenue growth for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.","To briefly recap 2016, revenue of a 184.8 billion grew nearly $28 billion or 18%, as earnings from operations advanced over 20% to $13.3 billion. Revenues advanced 24% to $7.3 billion and adjusted net earnings per share grew 25% to $8.05 per share for the year. ","Fourth quarter 2016 results included $47.5 billion in revenues, more than $3.5 billion in earnings from operations. Net earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.11. All of these results were at or modestly ahead of the expectations set at our investor conference in late November. ","Operating cash flows for the year were $9.8 billion, 1.34 times net earnings, within our range of expectation despite timing changes in several state payments. We look forward to the opportunities of 2017, as we continue to drive our agenda of quality based net promoter or NPS performance and growth. ","Building on the momentum of strong NPS gains in 2016, and that being we began 2017 with one of the stronger operational starts to a new year we\u2019ve ever had. We remain fully committed to meeting or exceeding the 2017 outlook we previewed with you at our investor conference, and Dave Wichmann and Larry Renfro will discuss, we have solid growth momentum going in to 2017, so we will turn to their commentary beginning with Larry. ","Larry Renfro","Thank you Steve. Customers of both UnitedHealthcare and Optum have been responding to our focus MPS, quality and value efforts. These are the building blocks of valuable, deep, long term relationships. Customer retention was a factor in UnitedHealth Group\u2019s 2016 growth and that continues as we answer 2017. ","The healthcare customers we serve turn to us to solve large complex problems. UnitedHealthcare for example, is increasingly helping states managed care for their complex, highly vulnerable and most costly populations. We also continue assist employers with effective, innovative programs to support the needs of their retirees and employees challenged by chronic health issues. ","For Optum, 2016 was a distinguishing year for developing and deepening relationships across healthcare, as we deliver more value to the market place. In the first quarter, we announced a strategic relationship with Walgreens, offering more choice and greater savings to both consumers and their sponsors. ","We also entered in to a technology partnership with Availity, a leading health IT provider to meaningfully improve connectivity and processing for payer, care providers and consumers. In the second quarter, several audit organizations engaged Optum to deliver pharmacy care services in 2017, in response to our progressive clinical models for whole-person care.","Quest Diagnostics joined us in the third quarter in collaboration that will span several of Optum\u2019s businesses starting with Optum 360. We were honored to receive several important multi-year contracts from the Department of Veterans Affairs and we partnered with Allscripts across OptumInsight and Optum Health. ","In the fourth quarter, we were pleased to announce a new relationship with CVS Health that will strengthen their retail and our pharmacy care service offerings to the benefit of consumers. Moving in to this year, last week we announced we will join the Surgical Care Affiliates or SCA. This combination will expand the breadth of care delivery capabilities at Optum, as we continue to evolve a comprehensive ambulatory care platform including primary, urgent, surgical and homecare, all designed to deliver higher value and quality healthcare to consumers and payers. ","Surgeons operating in SCA centers perform nearly 1 million surgeries annually in over 200 locations across 33 states with consistently high quality consumer satisfaction and improved value. ","In SCA, we will grow and build upon a leader we know well in a high growth market. A market where we have already gained meaningful market presence, experience and insight through awesome care. The momentum inside our businesses comes from the growth and depth of these relationships and the breadth of sustainable value we can offer. ","In 2016, Optum revenues grew 24% to $83.6 billion, as earnings from operations grew 32% to more than $5.6 billion slightly ahead of our most recent outlook. Fourth quarter 2016, was the first anniversary of the Catamaran acquisition and we were pleased with the operating earnings growth of 18% in the quarter for Optum overall, lead by 27% growth at OptumRx.","Margins reached 8.1% in the fourth quarter and were 6.7% for the full year, up 40 basis points over 2015. Looking to 2017, OptumInsight\u2019s year-end backlog grew 21% to $12.6 billion. As we stand back from Optum and look at our progress, we are advancing the quality and consistency of our services to customers, simplifying our business, strengthening our leadership team and boasting our resources and investments in the most important growth trends in healthcare. ","While there is more to be done in the United States and globally, the opportunities continue to grow even faster and larger. We are optimistic about our outlook for 2017, with revenues exceeding $90 billion and earnings from operations in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion. ","In 2017, at Optum and across UnitedHealth Group, we are committed to grow by developing stronger relationships, delivering consistent value to strengthen NPS and helping make health systems work better for more people. ","Now let me turn it over to Dave. ","Dave Wichmann","Thank you Larry. UnitedHealthcare also enters 2017 with strong momentum. Fourth quarter and full year 2016 revenues were well balanced growing by double-digit percentages in every product category. Medical cost remained well managed with commercial medical cost trend ending the year in line with expectations at approximately 6%. ","2016 was one of the strongest organic growth years in our history, with more than 2 million members joining. UnitedHealthcare continues to build well diversified growth momentum as customers and consumer retention rates continue to improve broadly, with notable strength in small and mid-sized commercial groups and in Medicare. ","In the full risk commercial risk business, we grew by 205,000 people in the quarter and 375,000 people for the year providing a positive starting point as we enter 2017. This growth was broad based, appropriately priced and balanced across geographic regions, products and customer types. ","In the self-funded segment, the market has been stable with strengthening employment rates helping us grow within existing customers. In 2016, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve an additional 335,000 commercial fee based consumers, including 20,000 more in the fourth quarter.","As expected, individual business declined in the fourth quarter, premium deficiency reserves taken earlier this year were sufficient, and we maintained an appropriate and prudent residual reserve for claims not yet received. Consistent with our commitments too early in 2016, we did not ACA compliant individual business carries any financial exposure forward in 2017. ","Turning to Medicare, in 2016 we grew our medical membership organically by 625,000 people, about two-thirds through Medicare advantage. 2016 was among our best Medicare growth years, but we expect 2017 to be even stronger. Our positive Medicare advantage performance in 2016 was driven by the combination premium and benefit stability, rising stars performance and improved service and clinical performance all leading to record retention rates. ","These same factors are driving 2017 growth. We expect to serve nearly one million more senior will medical benefits this year including more than three quarters of a million seniors in Medicare advantage balanced and diversified by regions, channel and products. ","Moving to Medicaid, adding 100,000 people in the quarter brought our full year growth to 585,000, once again broad-based and organic from new programs in both new and existing space. ","In 2017, we will introduce services in the states of Virginia and Missouri and plan to enter Colorado via the pending partnership with Rocky Mountain Health plan, further expanding the number of state partners we serve. ","As we recap the year, UnitedHealthcare revenues of $148.6 billion grew 13% year-over-year, virtually all organic as it has been over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by double digit percentage in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016. Earnings from operations exceeded $7.6 billion and grew at 13% or over $900 million. ","Turning to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, our fourth quarter revenues of $47.5 billion grew 9% over last year. The fourth quarter consolidated medical care ratio decreased 190 basis points to 80.8% slightly outperforming our recent investor conference outlook. ","The full year care ratio of 81.2% improved 50 basis points year-over-year with core businesses overcoming both the pressures in the individual market in the first half of 2016, and the higher levels of reserve development in 2015. The full year operating cost ratio improved 30 basis points to 15.2% in line with our investor conference forecast. ","As we step in to 2017, there are a number positive indications that reflect our continuing momentum. Our focus on quality and NPS\u2019s intensifying and bearing results. Consumers continue to engage more deeply in their health earning $255 million in healthy behavioral incentives in 2016. ","We began the year crisply in customer installation and service on record levels of new and diversified growth across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum enters the year with record backlog, people served and adjusted scripts. And with Optum bank crossing the $7 billion mark in consumer health assets under management, Optum in pursuing a strong vision as a health service organization unlike any in existence today. ","We will continue to develop our business to fit that vision in 2017. Our merger with SCA will significantly expand our capabilities for consumers, payers and hospital partners that often care, while establishing presence in new markets. ","UnitedHealthcare enter the year with strong retention rates and new business growth across all three lines of business, and we are seeing improving performance and earnings contribution from our hospital company and health plan in Brazil. ","We should touch briefly on Penn Treaty an industry topic we first discussed in 2010 that finally seems to be resolving. Penn Treaty is a financially distressed long term care insurance company with no affiliation to us. While we have never sold long term care policies, under state laws health insurers will be assessed a share of the guarantee funds needed to protect Penn Treaties policy holders. ","We expect to accrue an approximately $315 million operating charge for our portion of the assessment. This charge will be funded over several years and the cash will be largely recovered through premium tax credits overtime. ","While this outcome is well known, current accounting practice only allows this charge to be recognized when a final court order of liquidation is entered. When that ultimately occurs we will incorporate the impact in GAAP earnings, while excluding it from adjusted earnings per share. ","To wrap, we remain committed to our outlook for 2017 revenues of $197 billion to $199 billion adjusted net earnings of $9.30 to $9.60 per share and cash flows from operations of $11.5 billion to $12 billion. Only 17 days in to the year, we think this posture strikes an appropriate balance of optimism and prudence. Steve?","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you Dave. You may notice a separate press release this morning announcing that Tim Flynn has joined the Board of UnitedHealth Group. Tim is an exceptionally creative and solutions oriented executive, a former global managing partner of KPMG. Tim has deep financial and global operating expertise, he is also deeply versed in corporate governance, and we are thrilled to welcome Tim to our Board of Directors. ","We\u2019ll close with a few words on the overall domestic healthcare landscape. To be clear, we have no better sense than anyone else concerning the timing or any ultimate actions with respect to the Affordable Care Act. So any questions and responses on that subject need to have that clear context. And as you would anticipate, we will not speculate on hypothetical or provocative questions in this area this morning. ","Our posture has remained consistent for some time now. We remain positive and constructive with respect to what ultimately evolves in the next phase of healthcare change. We see the opportunity for robust, state based healthcare markets offering flexible commercial benefits, flexible Medicaid available to eligible as well as pain beneficiaries, well-structured and managed high risk pools, exchanges where space choose to sustain them and much more. ","We believe all of these taken together can represent affective, local, state based coverage systems which can well accommodate those currently in the ACA individual exchanges, as well as serve as channels for further expanding coverage if that remains the focus. ","We see this approach as being simpler, offering more flexibility, more choice and more affordability to both consumers and state and federal sponsors. And as we have for many years, we remain staunch advocates for affordable coverage infrastructure that supports a modern healthcare system including a strong and diversified future oriented healthcare work force and improvements to government sponsored benefits that incorporate better use of technology, information and care resources for Americans. ","UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare remain full committed to our mission, to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Today we see more opportunities to serve and grow in the next 10 years than the past 10. We will remain and adaptable, innovative and restless enterprise. We see many ways we can work, our work can continue to improve, if we stay focused on that mission, and we are committed to pursue that goal in 2017 and a decade ahead. ","We thank you for your interest today and now we\u2019ll take questions. Again one at a time please, and we\u2019ll try to respond as many as we can today. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question is coming from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Borsch","I just was hoping that you could address the question to the Pennsylvania Medicaid contracts, and how the latest developed in the re-bid might or might not have affected your guidance relative to what you had already baked in for those contracts. ","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. I\u2019ll have Austin do that, but those will that affect our guidance at all after \u201917. Austin?","Austin Pittman","Sure. First let me say that our commitment has been and still is to focus on the service of the people in Pennsylvania. That\u2019s what we get up and do every single day, so we\u2019re staying very focused there. As per the Medicaid program or health choices, as you know, we currently serve about 220,000 Pennsylvanians. The procurement process as has been noted has been particularly troubling to us both the lack of transparency and the material shifts and the outcome itself. ","If you recall, we went from retaining our existing footprint and expanding state-wide in the initial ward to being eliminated from the program through this latest protest and rebid process. So we have formerly protest as others have. We\u2019re pursuing all of our available options to get transparency. As we get acquainted with the details, we\u2019ll take further action from there. In the meantime, as I said at the start we\u2019ll stay focused on serving the people of Pennsylvania. ","Matthew Borsch","Just on the guidance, I thought that Medicaid enrollment ads for this year included maybe a material number for Pennsylvania, was that wrong about that?","Stephen Hemsley","No I just think that this process will take some time. I think the protest will extend and I think we also have other opportunities throughout the course of the year. So I don\u2019t think that single state like that will affect our outlook. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","David Windley","Acknowledging that your intent in OptumCare is to be multi-payer, I wondered if you could comment on how much of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s medical cost is flowing through OptumCare, what your goals for that might be and then how Surgical Care affiliates falls in to that or leverage that opportunity thanks? ","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. I think we\u2019ll have a Larry kind of comment on that. I guess I would focus on the fact that we serve multiple payers through our OptumCare platform have for some time that portfolio continues to expand SCA fits right in to it. ","Larry Renfro","Sure. Dave, I\u2019m going to go back a little bit and talk about how we kind of got where we are at with OptumCare, where we are in terms of SCA at this point in time. So if you go back in time five years ago, we had this one Optum plan that we put together and as part of that structure we had a 75 market strategy. ","Now all this relates to UHC and how we have positioned Optum from the start. So with a 75 market strategy we\u2019ve kind of looked at the market place at a $500 billion market place that now has grown to $1 trillion. And as part of that, we have looked at what the growth pillars are going to be in the future and OptumCare is the piece of that, and that\u2019s where SCA will fit.","And as SCA is a great organization that we are bringing in that\u2019s going to add scope and scale, it\u2019s going to be very complementary to what we\u2019re doing. So we feel pretty strong about SCA. We feel pretty strong about OptumCare being a big piece of our strategy going forward in the future to get to the breadth of the market that we\u2019re trying to penetrate. ","I might ask Dan Schumacher to comment a bit about the UHC side. Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Thank you Larry. As we look at surgeries broadly, obviously the deal to winning a majority of those still take place in hospital setting both inpatient and outpatient and so the reality is that there is a huge opportunity for greater penetration for surgery to take place in an ambulatory setting. And when you look at the kind of quality that can be demonstrated through and ambulatory setting as well as the patient satisfaction that frankly runs north of 90 when you look at the net promoter scores and you see a cost profit that runs about half of what you\u2019d expect in an hospital setting, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity. ","And within UnitedHealthcare for some time we\u2019ve been focused on sight of service for several years and we\u2019ve made some headway, but the reality is, we think there\u2019s an opportunity to really accelerate and we think the partnership with SCA provides a great potential. ","Stephen Hemsley","And if I\u2019m not speaking enough Dave Wichmann will correct me on this. A little less than half or roughly half of the flow that goes, the activity flow that goes through OptumCare is UnitedHealthcare and only 12% of SCA is UnitedHealthcare, is that true?","Dave Wichmann","That\u2019s right Steve. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jane Farr with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Jane Farr","United saw a strong Medicare growth in January. The penetration for the overall market went up more than I've ever seen in January versus December jobs. So, can you talk to your view of underlying long-term growth for Medicare Advantage, either for United specifically or the industry, and your view on where MA penetration could go now that we have the younger population aging in? If you have any numbers around how much of your (inaudible) growth was from fee for service that would be helpful as well?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. I think Steve Nelson can handle this. ","Steve Nelson","Sure. This is Steve Nelson. We will talk a little about our growth not speculating on the broader industry, but we did see higher this year as you noted and so the program continues to be really popular and very effective. ","Just commenting on our growth, I\u2019d reiterate what Dave said in his prepared comment. The growth that we see coming out of AEP is very strong and in line with the guidance that we\u2019ve provided in our November investor conference. And one sort of an important point there is, about 85% of our full year guidance actually comes to us on January, so the bulk of that membership is already with us. ","We have some pretty good insight in to the mix as well, and as you can - as we\u2019ve talked about before about half of that was from our group business so we\u2019ve a lot of insight in to that membership and in fact a lot of times we have claims experience there. And then we also had broad growth all of our geographies, markets and products. So really the product stability, the product portfolio, the offers choice is really resonating in the market.","There are several drivers that I would attribute to at least our growth as we are experiencing this strong growth for 2017. Again the product portfolio that we\u2019ve worked hard over the past several years to put this in place. Also really strong engagement and with our distribution partnership across all of our channels really brand in the market for UnitedHealthcare and then also the investments and the improvements we\u2019ve made in as Dave noted in our stars quality and also in our member experience. ","So I think this really positions us well to receive this growth and to continue to grow not only in 2017, but beyond. In terms of the conversions, it\u2019s a little early to get in to specific details about the conversions from fee for service, but again there was some market share growth and Medicare wedge overall, and I think it\u2019s a testament to the effectiveness of the program where you see higher outcomes, lower costs and very high satisfaction. ","Stephen Hemsley","Thanks Steve. And despite the fact that MA has been underfunded over the last several years, it continues to take share with or take 1.3% or 1.5% market share shit is the indication. That\u2019s been pretty steady despite the fact that it\u2019s been underfunded. It is clearly the most popular form of Medicare; it serves the lower income groups. It has great retention value, and we would think that that will continue so that the share of Medicare Advantage will ultimately continue to grow and take its place in terms of the government programs. Next question please. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Justine Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ","Steve Baxter","This is Steve Baxter on for Justin. A question for you about the OptumInsight backlog. Appreciating that the backlog here is at a record level, but we noticed that it was flat sequentially for the first time since 2013 heading into the ACA implementation. I was hoping you could speak to what you're hearing from clients, and in particular, are you seeing any uncertainty with hospital buying patterns just given the uncertainty of where we might be going with (inaudible) and replace?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. Larry you want to take it or Bill Miller. ","Larry Renfro","I will start and then I will hand it to Bill. I think that if you look at fourth quarter you\u2019ll see that we had a pretty strong fourth quarter specially OptumInsight and Bill will speak to that in a second. So all of our financials were in line with our expectations. ","One thing to keep in mind, when it comes to technology services and how we look at Optum360 across the board is that we are very diversified. When we really serve is 300 health plans, 4500 hospitals, over a couple of hundred government agencies and so forth. So we have a lot of opportunity and its diversified opportunity. So Bill just comment on the quarter.","Bill Miller","We\u2019re real happy with our performance in Q4 and a part of that confidence in going forward and with respect to the pipeline and the backlog is, there\u2019s several metrics that we look at and while hospital is one sector that we work with, you understand that we have a really wide constituencies of payer provider life sciences companies and government and across the board we\u2019re seeing enormous growth in our pipeline. Our sales and some of the size of the sale in each of those geographies have clients has grown dramatically year-over-year. ","And if I look at and search for slow-downs, we don\u2019t see it because if you look at the solutions that we provide, they are mission-critical, they are implementing marked technology, they have proven ROI. So we\u2019re not seeing the slow-down that perhaps is being felt in other places because of our diversity, the mission critical nature of our solutions that we bring to market. And so we are seeing wide adoption.","And with respect to the backlog, while they may have been a little flat in this quarter-over-quarter, if you look at the year-over-year growth it\u2019s a tremendous story. If you look at any given quarter, we\u2019re going to burn through some backlog, there\u2019s projects that get completed and so that doesn\u2019t concern us. ","I think we look at the year-over-year metric and feel really positive and heading in to \u201917, if you look at how much time we spent in the market, the way we\u2019ve developed our products and the interviews that we do with clients and the expansion of all of our key clients, it sets us up for another really successful year, despite of the fact that there is some uncertainty about ACA and others. That uncertainty always creates opportunities for Optum because clients are looking for ways to thrive and survive in these uncertain times and Optum becomes a really relative and significant client and partner to talk to in those context. ","Stephen Hemsley","Yeah, I couldn\u2019t agree with that more. Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ","Peter Costa","Can you give us some more specifics on a couple of (inaudible) in the quarter, in particular the unfavorable development in the fourth quarter and the higher interest and other income in the quarter?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure, we\u2019ll split those out, maybe Dan the development and John Rex, the investment income. ","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Good morning Peter. Dan Schumacher. Let me offer a couple of comments about medical overall and more specifically to your question around development. Now as you look at our consolidated medical care ratio for the quarter, it was a little bit than what we had discussed at the end of November and then inside that I\u2019d tell you that our medical cost continued to be well controlled. ","And the other thing, as you look at development sort of quarter in and quarter out, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that it\u2019s on a base of medical spend on an annual basis of more than a $115 billion. So when you look at the outcomes this quarter in particular, it isn\u2019t particularly meaningful. ","Looking specifically at this quarter, I\u2019d tell you that if you look across it both from a geography perspective look across categories I don\u2019t think that there is anything that is worth highlighting. I would tell you that it probably orients a little bit more towards our government businesses, and underneath that we\u2019ve talked overtime about some of the efforts we\u2019ve had around incentives related to quality and the underlying use that comes with that and we\u2019ve seen some of that this quarter and that\u2019s showing up in those outcomes.","But importantly and overall I\u2019d tell you that our medical base line is for our all of our businesses, we are tracking in line with our expectations as we close the year and that means that we are starting 2017 where we had planned. ","John Rex","Peter, this is John Rex on investment income. Really two major elements driving most of that put in the category just larger balances outstanding due to the growth we\u2019re seeing at UHC and Optum Bank. So those are large interest earning balances across those books. In addition higher realized capital gains for our investment portfolio. ","So, we did some pro-active portfolio of re-alignment ahead of the fed interest rate actions to capture some of that value and compare to our reinvested higher rates going forward as those occurred and so we wanted to be proactive as we are anticipating those events. Let\u2019s say, if I take both those elements rather balanced in terms of the higher investment income that you\u2019re seeing in the quarter. ","Stephen Hemsley","Next question please. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Scott Fidel","Steve wanted to ask a thematic question here, just as we enter into the whole discussion around corporate tax reform, and just thinking about the minimum medical loss ratios in that context. Clearly it hasn't seemed like the (inaudible) LMRs have proven to be that big of a deal the last couple of years, but just now as we think about corporate tax reform and then leveraging the benefits of that, do you think it might make sense for the industry to perhaps get more proactive on rethinking the minimum LMRs and maybe lobbying to have some relief there, or basically the question is do you think that minimum LMRs could end up offsetting a lot of the benefits to shareholders from corporate tax reform or not? ","Stephen Hemsley","So again Scott we\u2019re not really engage in commentary around policy or what could or couldn\u2019t happen. The only comment I\u2019d make about MLRs and why they were probably not as controversial is because for the most part our offerings were pretty close to those MLR levels anyway. So they\u2019re pretty much across the board. So that\u2019s why I think that they were managed and digest across the industry. And beyond that, we\u2019re just not going to comment on what tax policy could be or what might come forward in terms of changes in the ACA. ","Our commentary with the market place has really been more broadly about what could be simpler, more sustainable, local market based coverage approaches. So that\u2019s kind of where our level of commentary has been. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Ralph Jacoby","Just want to go back to the SCAI deal; obviously it looks like a platform deal in what's a fragmented market. So one, just wanted to make sure I understand the strategy, is it to sort of accelerate the M&A pace or is it a little bit more of a test model, if you will for now? And then how will you navigate, and maybe have you had conversations with all of the various partnerships and JVs, some of which are obviously with other payers as well as hospital systems that could create some friction?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. Larry will comment on this, but we think this step is an important development step. So we think this is a market leading platform we can build on, so we do think it\u2019s important that it fits nicely in to the whole narrative of more comprehensive, local market base, ambulatory care platform. So that\u2019s the high level thinking behind it. Larry you want to pick it up?","Larry Renfro","Sure, and I\u2019m going to ask Tami to talk about the footprint so that you get a feel for the footprint and how everything is going to work together inside Optum in regard to SCA and why it\u2019s a primary focus for us. And then I\u2019m going to ask Amir Rubin really to talk about what\u2019s been going on in the diligence side of this and what the business looks like. ","I will caution you that we are in an approval process. So during this approval process there\u2019re certain things obviously that we can\u2019t do, but I think I can lay out the strategy and these folks will be able to pack it up. I probably didn\u2019t do a good job a few minutes ago of explaining it, but this goes back five years. This is a strategy that we put in place to really go after what I would call the OptumCare business as one of our primary pillar for growth. ","We started with primary care and I think you know that we\u2019ve been growing primary care over the last few years. We\u2019re probably around 21,000 physicians at this point. The second part of OptumCare was our urgent care with Med Express and other centers that we have set up with urgent care. So we\u2019re up to 250 centers there. So obviously the surgery center kind of starts to play out and add capabilities for us as we go forward. ","So this is all about growth, and this is about us maintaining our physician with the ambulatory side to really make this move forward, not only here but also globally. Because as we look and I\u2019m going to stray here but just for a second, but I would tell you that the work that we are doing in Brazil, the work that we\u2019re doing in London, what we\u2019re expecting to do across Europe and so forth. This is all a process that would fit nicely in all of those markets.","So let me turn it over to Tami to kind of go through the footprint. ","Tami Reller","Thanks Larry, and maybe just a couple of OptumCare broader perspectives and numbers to give this context before Amir talks specifically about SCA. If you look at OptumCare today, it already represents more than 50% of OptumHealth revenues. And obviously this is an important growth platform, so we expect more in the future. Also if you look at OptumCare, today we have a footprint in 28 primary care markets that expect to expand in to four to six new markets per years. ","And so as we look at the opportunity between OptumCare broadly and SCA which today has 200 locations in 33 states which we noted earlier, there is an opportunity there to really look at that much more holistically and make some good growth come from that. ","Larry also noted the more 21,000 physicians today and we would expect to continue to grow that as a nice clip in to the future as well OptumCare probably 2,000 per year as we move forward. So a tremendous amount of growth ahead across the OptumCare platform. ","Amir Rubin","This is Amir Rubin, just to add to Larry and Tami\u2019s comments. We did a detailed due diligence process and we were very, very impressed with the exceptional SCA leadership and the model that SCA has developed across the country. As you heard from Steve\u2019s opening remarks, SCA has over 200 centers in 33 states and these are terrific centers with outstanding quality accredited and certified by the highest accreditation bodies NPS scores, Net Promoter Scores of 90 on average, really high net promoter scores delivering outstanding surgical procedures that have the cost of inpatient settings in partnership with surgeons, in partnership with health systems, many of whom are our clients and serving communities very effectively. ","As you heard from Tami, we\u2019re excited too. There\u2019s a nice overlap, probably about 50% overlap with the SCA market and the OptumCare market, and moreover SCA and its surgeons and the health systems that it partners with, are now looking to move even more complex cases in to the ambulatory arena such as joint replacements, hips and knees and really on the front end of delivering high quality, high service and value based care, serving all care, UnitedHealthcare, as you\u2019ve heard from Dan Schumacher and across OptumCare we serve over 85 cares that we are very excited to continue serving the broad payer market partnering with our health system clients and aligning with physician for the community. ","Larry Renfro","This is Larry again. Let me just make one comment. So if you looked at our 75 market strategy that we\u2019ve been executing against today, we are in 28 markets. With this acquisition, we will pick up about 17 more markets. So about 50% of SCA markets overlap with 17 new markets. So this is going to accelerate our growth obviously, and this is a very, very key point in the growth of OptumCare.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Josh Raskin","Wanted to follow up, I understand Steve you don't want to speculate on potential regulatory changes etcetera, so without getting into any details on what you're expecting. One, have you spoken with the incoming President-elect or his team, and then are there any changes that you\u2019ve made strategically already? So forgetting about what can happen in the world, but is there anything you're doing in the markets today that would relate to some things that you think could potentially happen?","Stephen Hemsley","Josh, I would have preferred to answer the last one compared to this one. We\u2019ve maintained an presence broadly in the healthcare sector, again policy sector, and have been consistent for some time, and I think you\u2019ve seen our materials with respect to really advancing a simpler state-based healthcare system around investments going forward in to the healthcare sector around affordability and good sustainable ways to advance affordability. ","Systematically very much involved and we have been offering specific ideas with respect to that. It aligns with the businesses that we\u2019ve had in the philosophy and the mission of our enterprise about helping people live healthier lives and about making the system work better for everyone, everyone being all the participants in the healthcare market place. ","It has been more at a, what I would call, a high level and then invoked more specifically when called upon. We think that\u2019s a sustainable way, we have been on this for some time, prior to the outcome of any elections etcetera. So we would have been indifferent in terms of who would have proceeded that these would be the kinds of themes that we think will drive a better and higher performing healthcare systems that could serve more Americans. ","And we continued to be on that track and I think the setup of that business as we\u2019ve said many times, the participation across the expanse of the benefit market and the continued diversification in the important markets with Optum, serving areas that where we think we can bring our competencies around, expertise around information and insights about how healthcare could be organized and resources used more affectively and the virtuous application of technology to drive a more modern healthcare system. Those are things that are really native to our businesses at this point in time, very adaptable, so adaptability is a very important thing for us. ","We can move these things around to approach the market place in different ways, and we think we have been developing the kind of assets and capabilities to serve a healthcare system and combinate a variety of approaches. So that has kind of philosophy and that has been our narrative with the policy community and expert community and will continue to stay in a positive constructive posture in that way because I think it\u2019s - this as we\u2019ve said many times will continue to evolve both as a market place and in terms of national policy. ","So I don\u2019t know what I could tell you more than that, that\u2019s kind of the philosophy we bring to it and it\u2019s the same philosophy that we speak in Washington and in state capitals, and I think it has and I think it will continue to serve us well and I think be positive to the healthcare market place. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Michael Baker","I was wondering if you could comment or give an early read on the PBM selling season in terms of potential for activity versus what we saw for the last selling season.","Stephen Hemsley","Mark you want to comment?","Mark Thierer","It\u2019s busy, it\u2019s busy. This last year we really felt good about the big wins that we posted. It was the largest selling season obviously in our history. But at this point in the selling season we\u2019re queuing up for lots of new employers and health plans are coming to market as well. So I would say right now our pipeline is larger than it\u2019s ever been. And I will just take a moment and tell you, in this business you have to start your new business well, because the market checks and - it\u2019s a small business and we\u2019ve just had our best one won I think in the history of the business our readiness and our preparation for some very large scale clients was I think superior and we are gauging this by how our clients are reacting and the NPS scores that we\u2019re seeing.","So this successful won one on last year\u2019s selling season sets us up very well for the 2017 selling season. As I said the pipeline is robust. We are pushing our new value prop and we do think that the synchronization message is totally resonating and clients are migrating towards it. So we are feeling pretty good about our opportunity in 2017. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from AJ Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. ","A.J. Rice","I might just ask a two-part question on the international business. I think the comments were made in the prepared remarks that you're pleased with the progress you've made down there and I noticed that fourth quarter you had good enrollment in Brazil. You have to go back to fourth quarter of last year for a positive sequential enrollment as well, I don't know if there's something seasonality that drives that or some other dynamic that's going on. ","But can you just give us an update on where things stand there, and where you are at relative to contribution margins. And the other aspect on international I was just going to ask you about is I think you guys have commented that there are some contracts that Optum is looking at, particularly in the UK, potentially. Can you give us any update on the timing of when we might see those?","Dave Wichmann","A.J. it\u2019s Dave. I think I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then ask Larry to comment on the Optum contracts in particular. A.J. I wish I could say that was organic growth down in Brazil, but it was actually a small acquisition that we completed of both a health insurance company and a healthcare company. So it\u2019s an integrated delivery system that serves the ABC region near Sao Paolo. It\u2019s named Santa Elaina and it is a very strong, well performing local delivery system there that really serves the lower end of the middle class broadly. ","So it added about 250,000 lives or so to our quarter. Maybe I\u2019m not really sure how to respond to the contribution margin comment, but I will say that we do see an improved outlook for Amil and now what is called Americas (inaudible) which is our large national healthcare delivery system predominantly hospital based in Brazil. Of course the political and economic instability certainly aren\u2019t helping the business today, but we have seen nice progress and we have an improved outlook for 2017 for the business. ","You probably have noticed that we made a couple of augmentations to our leadership team down there. We just brought on Claudio Lottenberg, who was the former President of the Albert Einstein Health System. He is a fantastic leader, very well regarded across Brazil and we think he\u2019ll be a terrific addition to our business.","We also named a Louis DeLuca to run our Americas health system. He came to us from Samaritano which was the large hospital that we acquired in San Paolo. And then we\u2019ve also added a number of other physicians in the business. I think strengthening leadership and importantly as we come across a five year anniversary looking to make sure that we have a very strong leadership team in place as we transition a generation. ","Our new team is performing very well, they are focused on more modernized health system and building a strong healthcare infrastructure, and we continue to remain bullish and optimistic about not only the prospects for Amil and Americas (inaudible) but also Brazil broadly. Larry you\u2019re going to touch on Optum?","Larry Renfro","Sure. A.J. its Larry. I think on the last earnings call, we talked a little about that. We have been building a foundation in London in the UK area, and we had spent past year really getting our self positioned in what I would call the new models care. We would know it here as the ACLs. As they are starting to take their trust and trust over there are their hospitals, and they are starting to put them together in certain segments of the country, and they\u2019re looking for services that we provide whether that be hospital type services or what we are doing with OptumCare. That\u2019s why there is a very large overlap here when you start talking about OptumCare and what we might be able to do in the UK area. ","We are in bid and discussions with about five different areas, I won\u2019t go in to them from a competitive standpoint, and we believe in the first 6 to 9 months of this year, we shall start to see some outcome. So there\u2019s no question that it got delayed with Brexit and they\u2019ve had some change in terms of leadership and we\u2019ve had to establish ourselves with new leadership which just takes time. It\u2019s not an issue of them wanting to, they understand our model, a lot of the ministers have been here and they have visited our locations to see the integrated care and how we operate and so forth. ","SCA should be a positive in terms of how we might look at that eventually, not right away in the UK. So I guess one part of the question is, we\u2019ve got the circled areas that we\u2019re talking about that we are in bids on right now, 6 to 9 months we should start to see some outcomes there and we feel pretty solid about that. ","The other path we\u2019re going down is on what I\u2019ll call national programs and the big national programs is what I would call a national database where we could bring our data and analytics in to play. Again we are in the process with that and I would think that timing might be a little slower, it might six months, 3 to 6 months and the decision is ours. ","So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. We\u2019ve got a good team, we\u2019re moving some senior leaders over to the UK and again I think that come summer time we should start to see some results there. ","Stephen Hemsley","We\u2019ll do two or three more questions. So the next please. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Kevin Fischbeck","You said in the commentary that the exchange performance was better year-over-year. Was that simply just a lack of a PDR from the prior year or you\u2019re actually seeing stabilization. I think you last quarter you said that the Q3 results and the exchanges were stabilizing, wanted to see the color down to Q4.","Stephen Hemsley","I think it\u2019s broadly stable. ","Dan Schumacher","Kevin, its Dan Schumacher. I think the point we\u2019re making there is, last year we recorded the Premium Deficiency Reserve to provide for losses in 2016, and so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, you had to drag in \u201915 and then we resolved the PDR and the exchanges in the fourth quarter this year. So that\u2019s the improvement we are talking about year-over-year. ","Kevin Fischbeck","So versus Q3 it was stable?","Dan Schumacher","Versus Q3?","Kevin Fischbeck","Expectations versus Q3?","Dan Schumacher","Yeah, generally in line with expectations. ","Stephen Hemsley","Our view on exchanges haven\u2019t changed. Next please. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Lance Wilkes","Yeah, I had a question on PBM margins, and just wanted to know a couple of points on those. One, as you saw improvement for the quarter, how much of that is mergers synergies and how much - as you look into 2017 of your merger synergy plan are you through? And then related to that would be what sort of trends are you seeing from both manufacturers and rebates on the cost side and what are the trends like on the client side as you look at your margins? ","Stephen Hemsley","So that is about a four-part question Mark, so do you want to --?","Mark Thierer","So let me just talk about margins in this business. We\u2019ve talked for some time now that we\u2019re comfortable with operating margins in the 3-5 points, and so you asked about synergies. We met and actually exceeded our $0.30 commitment in the 2016 planned year. We\u2019ve not provided a specific outlook on synergies for \u201917, but I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve got running room in the plan and work to do still to extract synergies from the combination. So that has exceeded our expectations and been very solid and I would like to just tip the hat to the operating team who\u2019s made this work happen, it\u2019s been exceptional. ","You asked about rebates and the picture going forward. This is the thing that we\u2019re paid to do. We\u2019re paid to go to the supply chain on behalf of our clients and extract savings for the benefit of the consumer and obviously for the plants sponsor. So we think that we\u2019ve created a business model here where we have best-in-class contracting capabilities that we take not just to the pharmaceutical industry, but we take it to the retail chains, we take it to the biotech manufacturers and we take it to the generic manufacturers as well as the wholesalers. ","So this entire supply chain, this is our job to extract savings for the benefit of the member and for the benefit of the plan sponsor, and the outlook for that in this coming year is really very solid. Hopefully that answers your question.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question please. This will be our last. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our last question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Sheryl Skolnick","Thank you so much, and I will try not to make it too difficult for you this time. So you've obviously had very significant success across UHC as well as across Optum, and I'm going to ask a similar question to what I asked in a different way. We've also noticed some interesting trends on utilization, despite some spiking from the ACA in hospital based utilization, particularly in patient care. ","And I'm wondering if you can help me to understand what steps you are taking and what you can attribute your management of cost trend, presumably related to appropriate controls on appropriate sites of care, and what the outlook might be given that you're now bringing OptumCare into a higher level of scale and capabilities with surgical care for your ability to further improve your cost trends through improved coordination and appropriateness of sight and timing and place of care? ","Mark Thierer","Well you\u2019ve kind of defined the space in the question, so you clearly have grasped the idea. The ambulatory platform that we are forming is in fact a very important and viable proposition in and of itself, it represents the more organized, more informed deployment of resources in terms of ambulatory care and very much focused on the appropriateness of setting. ","It also plays to themes that are clearly moving in the market place where these services are moving in to these better venues and in fact technology is a very powerful element behind it both in process and so forth. So it creates a better resource platform to serve consumers and that has implications for all that we serve. It is a multi-payer platform in UnitedHealthcare, it is an enterprise that is very effective and advancing on those and it provides them an advantage in terms of how they deploy it and integrate in to their offerings. So kind of that is a start, do you want to pick it up?","Dan Schumacher","Good morning Sheryl, Dan Schumacher. The only thing I would add, if you kind of look at it over the last eight years right, we\u2019ve been able to drive down on a per capita basis inpatient, and inside that we\u2019ve focused a lot in those early years around the conversion of inpatient to outpatient. And I think this is sort of the continued evolution as we focus more on the side of service to how do we get that outpatient in to the ambulatory setting. ","So we\u2019ve continuing to introduce more steps in controlled measures on the front end, but more importantly trying to put in incentives at the surgeon level that really can help drive to the most appropriate settings. So the combination of (inaudible) structure with the consumer providing a strong motivator and then likewise on the delivery side trying to put incentives in place for the surgeons to be able to drive towards a more appropriate use.","So we really look at this partnership as an opportunity to really strengthen our value orientation, both in our product designs as well as in our relationships with the professionals that are providing these surgeries. ","Stephen Hemsley","And the OptumCare platform is free standing value up all by itself, so we basically have kind of a two-dimensional agenda going here and I think that\u2019s - whether that\u2019s core of your question and you\u2019ve grasped what we are doing in OptumCare very well. So again thank you for joining us today. I think the takeaways from this call are pretty straight forward that UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare represent a strong, diverse, well performing enterprise driven by mission and culture with strong leadership team, dedicated employees.","We remain very committed to taking our performance to even higher levels of quality, value, growth, shareholder return and service to emerging needs of enormous global healthcare market place. So we continue to evolve and adapt to serve that market, helping people live healthier lives and making the system work better for everyone. ","Thank you for joining us we\u2019ll see you next question. Thanks.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.

I will be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 16, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. You may begin, sir.","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review UnitedHealth Group's second quarter results. Our second quarter and first half are once again strong across our business portfolio continuing the performance consistency and growth momentum that have been advancing since the second half of 2014. The market sees real value in a simpler, more modern and helpful consumer experience, well-informed consumer and physician engagement, access to quality care, practical innovation and fair pricing. With the expected closing of the Catamaran transaction and improved momentum in our base business, we now expect 2015 revenues to be $154 billion, earnings to be in the range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share and cash flows from operations to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.","Second quarter revenues grew 11.3% year-over-year to $36.3 billion. After tax net margins improved 10 basis points and net earnings grew 15% year-over-year to $1.64 per share. Second quarter cash flows from operations also grew 15% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and brought first half 2015 operating cash flows to $3.4 billion or 114% of net income and this compares to 97% through the midpoint of last year. Second quarter earnings were driven by both consistent, broad-based growth at UnitedHealthcare and continued strong growth and improving margin performance from Optum. We are positioned well for the second half of 2015 and continue to forecast UnitedHealth Group's earnings per share growth will accelerate in 2016.","I will ask Larry Renfro to lead off today with a review of Optum and then Dave Wichmann will pick up with UnitedHealthcare and some UnitedHealth Group enterprise themes. Larry?","Larry Renfro","Thanks, Steve. Optum is firmly on track to achieve significant growth and performance targets for both 2015 and 2016. Second quarter results were strong across the board and position us well once again for a strong finish in the second half of the year. Optum revenues grew 16% in the second quarter. Optum's overall operating margin of 6.4% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points from the first quarter, with all businesses improving their margins sequentially. This higher overall margin on a growing revenue base drove 19% growth in Optum's earnings from operations this quarter. Through the first half of the year, Optum earned 42% of its full year operating earnings target, even while absorbing $42 million in Catamaran merger costs in the first quarter. Given normal seasonality, Optum is well on track to achieve its full year plan.","As we have shared before, Optum is focused on opportunities to dramatically elevate value for customers in five large growth markets, clinical care, pharmacy care services, technology solutions and government services, with international versions of these being the fifth opportunity. In pharmacy care services, there is a clear market need for a more integrated patient centered cost sensitive offering. We are committed to creating a next-generation pharmacy care services company. The addition of Catamaran accelerates our efforts significantly. Together, we believe we would better serve people through a comprehensive whole person approach that integrates data, information, analytics and clinical care insight to support care treatments and compliance rather than just filling prescriptions.","This is doubly true in the coming era of specialty drugs. We will bring better and more consistent overall quality and lower costs for consumers. This approach enhances the differentiated value OptumRx offers customers beyond the benefits of our combined purchasing of over one billion scripts per year. We expect the merger to close within the next two weeks. So we will be advancing this effort over the balance of this year slightly ahead of schedule.","Turning to the technology solutions market. Care providers are strongly embracing Optum360 offerings. They can leverage our technology infrastructure and full portfolio of solutions for modern, performance-based care delivery across the full range of care settings, including receiving comprehensive revenue management services and accompanying operating analytics computer-assisted coding, clinical documentation, ICD-10 compliance and population health management. These capabilities packaged as a comprehensive solution are designed to optimize the financial and service performance of the care provider customers we serve and help them transition to perform exceptionally well under performance-based and value-based delivery arrangements.","Optum360 has been one of the contributors to the overall growth in OptumInsight revenues which grew 13% this past quarter and contributed to growth in contract backlog of more than 35% externally reaching a record $9.8 billion in total at June 30. And we are seeing accelerating growth potential going forward, as Optum's overall sales pipeline of potential contract awards has grown to $14 billion, an increase of about 30% year-over-year in part due to significant proposals in the Optum360 markets.","OptumCare, our local care delivery business, helped drive 33% growth in Optum health revenues this quarter. We offer physicians a unique, strong and stable professional practice opportunity. We can support and equip them to do what they most clearly want, to practice medicine rather than administer a complex business. We have invested in modern technology with unique analytics and process tools to create service responsiveness for patients well beyond what standalone clinics deliver today and OptumCare offers compelling value to payers through risksharing capabilities that help them offer affordable health benefit products. The stability and growth in our patient base and payer relationships reflect the value our physicians provide. As this business matures, we expect to expand operating margins while delivering strong consistent revenue growth.","This past quarter, MedExpress joined OptumCare with nearly 150 freestanding neighborhood care centers in 16 local markets. MedExpress can offer as much as 90% of the care typically delivered in a hospital emergency room at about 90% lower cost. We are committed to growing as a leading provider of ambulatory care services, recognizing this capability will be increasingly valuable to the consumer and health care system overall. We offer these few examples to help illustrate Optum's diversity and commitment to delivering remarkable value for patients and customer. In each case, these examples are part of enduring relationships we are building with people who are seeking sophisticated trusted partners to help them address both the pressures and the opportunities across the whole health system. More than selling any one product, serving these client relationships well will be critical as Optum works to achieve its ambitious goals.","Now let me turn it over to Dave.","Dave Wichmann","Thank you, Larry. Starting first with UnitedHealthcare. Second quarter revenues grew a strong 10% organically to $33.1 billion, while operating margins were steady at 6.1%. The UnitedHealth Group consolidated medical care ratio improved 20 basis points year-over-year and throughout the first half medical costs were well controlled. The year-over-year decrease in the care ratio occurred despite the growth of about 1.3 million people in Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and public exchanges, all higher care ratio businesses.","The 2015 commercial medical cost trend outlook continues to be biased towards the lower portion of our 5.5% to 6.5% full-year forecast and we continue to expect a full year consolidated care ratio of 80.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Steady growth and discipline around care management and operating cost drove 11% operating earnings growth at UnitedHealthcare in the quarter. The core story for UnitedHealthcare continues to be one of distinctive organic gains in overall market share and above market revenue growth, along with continued emphasis on serving local market needs. We project domestic growth of 1.4 million people in 2015, bringing us to organic growth of nearly 10 million more people served in the United States in the past six years.","While this has been among the strongest organic growth periods we have experienced, we see continued growth potential going forward. We believe there are opportunities to serve substantially higher numbers of people to deliver further value and build equity with consumers and physicians in the benefits market. These opportunities stem from delivering practical innovations at fair price points and executing consistently in their local markets for the millions of people we serve.","Our newest products increasingly use configured networks that improve care quality and total cost and embeds complementary services to further strengthen value to the consumer. Our combination of informatics and dedicated local market clinical staff help us find people and engage them in the healthcare system to get the care they need at the right location at the right time. Consistently getting all this right, drives consumer trust and growth follows in an expanding market of more than 300 million people in the United States alone.","Let me flag a few representative examples. We are bridging the direct link between consumer engagement and lower per member cost trend and with employers' help further engaging consumers in their own health and wellness. This includes our product development efforts like Rally in cutting-edge areas like incentives, gamifications, missions and social networks. Engaging people on their own care informs them as real consumers and translates into better care, better care resource use and lower costs.","In July we released the next evolution of our diabetes prevention and weight management program called Real Appeal, which merges proven science and diabetes prevention with motivational multimedia weight and lifestyle management programs to reduce the onset of diabetes, reduce obesity and improve overall health and metabolic state. Real Appeal is the first digital extension of Rally both of which use life coaches and other motivational methods to achieve superior engagement, quality outcomes and economic results.","Similarly, we are using technology and data behind the scenes to advance the fundamentals of service. Our approach predicts and prioritizes the needs of inbound inquiries and connects the consumer through whatever communications channel they choose with clinical, wellness or administrative personnel based upon their predicted need making the service experience simpler, better and more complete for them and more efficient for us. We approach Medicaid in the context of the broader array of social services people need and states must address in support of better healthcare. We believe we can increase value for our state customers and our Medicaid members by helping connect people with our growing network of local market social services like transportation, housing and nutrition.","On the physician side, 465,000 physicians nationwide have signed up to use our secured cloud-based workspace called Link. Link enable doctors and their office staff to transact routine business with multiple payers more efficiently than they could ever do through traditional widely used channels like portals, faxes and phones. We are furthering that offering to support practice performance, risk arrangements and referrals through the deployment of tools for search and price transparency, referrals and online scheduling and we are just getting started. Think of Link as the end-to-end dashboard for managing all critical elements of an ambulatory practice fully integrated with the physicians practice management system.","Under benefit innovation, we continue to organize our networks around specific local market products expanding value-based purchasing and our medical network and next-generation patient incentives to help them get the right care and make the right decisions. This full alignment from the consumer through the care provider consistently delivers the highest value.","While modern technology positions us to target and engage people, it is our local people who close the circle. We have nurses who are performing one million clinical visits annually in seniors homes, nurses and case managers in local hospitals working alongside hospital staff, community health workers assisting Medicaid recipients neighborhood-by-neighborhood and physician office staff assistance helping document physician care quality for Medicare. Each one of these professionals puts a human face on UnitedHealthcare with every interaction they have at the local level, improving the quality of health care and reducing its costs. We believe no one else delivers such a total package nationally.","Looking forward, we continue to develop and more deeply integrate our capabilities. We believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at market differentiating pace profitably growing share as a direct result of the total value we are delivering and the brand equity we are building.","Before Steve sums up, let me touch on a couple of items for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. During the second quarter, we raised our dividend by another 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share. We plan to return nearly $2 billion to shareholders in dividend payments over the next year. As Larry mentioned, we expect to close the Catamaran merger in July after financing of the transaction our projected debt to total capital will be around 48% in the third quarter. We are committed to sustaining our strong financial position and current debt ratings and expect to reduce debt to total capital in short order.","With the deal expected to close in two weeks, we are incorporating Catamaran into our 2015 outlook. We foresee Catamaran adding around $10 billion in revenues this year, with full year 2015 UnitedHealth Group revenues now growing 18% year-over-year to approximately $154 billion and we now expect cash flows to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion in 2015.","In addition, we are increasing our outlook for our earnings per share to a range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share. The improvement comes from our core operating performance with Catamaran's impact on earnings over the balance of 2015 offset by interest, amortization and integration costs. We continue to foresee strong revenue, earnings accretion and cash flows from Catamaran in 2016 and increasing level thereafter, but again, Larry described for you the real story, which is the future value creation.","Steve?","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you, Dave. Larry and Dave have given you some sense for why we continue to be optimistic about our potential to deliver value throughout the broad health system and to growth. Let me just comment briefly before we summarize today's report.","Certainly, we all recognize this market space has been exceptionally active this quarter and beyond that observation we do not believe it is our place to comment on market specific activities or hypothetical implications that we are not involved in. And we are not going to comment on the activities of others or speculate on subsequent processes or market dynamics no one really yet knows. Our focus remains squarely on the continued growth and expand the capability of our enterprise and how we can serve our customers more effectively.","The markets we serve are changing in positive ways to call upon our competencies we have cultivated for years and accordingly these changes help prospects for years of positive growth in the continued expansion of our products and services. Our capabilities are strengthening and we are expanding into natural market adjacencies. We are intensely focused on these opportunities and committed to driving higher and more consistent performance for customers across our businesses.","The key elements of our efforts going forward are familiar and fundamental. Truly focusing on serving consumers, care providers and benefit sponsors, creating and adopting simpler, more modern approaches around how healthcare is paid for, around information transparency, consumer engagement and care access and care provider support, developing valuable long-term relationships with strong partners, pricing products and services that deliver real value to the market because our design approach in underlying cost structures are market-leading, executing to serve the key future growth areas for Optum, clinical care, integrated pharmacy care, technology solutions and government services, thoughtfully moving forward at the targeted global menus, using capital to strengthen capabilities and improve and expand our growth potential and cultivating capabilities that will be important to the future more than the past.","With that, we thank you and operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions at this time. [Operator Instructions]. We ask that you limit your question to one per person so that we can get as many questions as possible. And we will take our first question from David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Windley","Thanks. Good morning. Steve, acknowledging your comments about market activity, wondering if with Catamaran now near closed, what is United's appetite for further M&A activity? And maybe dovetailing that, what is your current view on provider consolidation and balance of power in local markets as it relates to negotiating your cost position? Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Well, in terms of the commentary along those lines, we have been building our business and diversifying our businesses across the landscape of our business model for several years and we can expect to continue those approaches, continue to diversify our business as we said in the natural market adjacencies, continue to deploy capital in ways that we think makes sense for us and continue to fill in market positions and to build on capabilities. So I don't think anything has really changed in that domain and I don't think there is any reason to think otherwise.","Our businesses are well positioned across the expanse of benefits and across services. We are well positioned across virtually all the key markets and think that we can continue to drive very strong cost positions, have plenty of scale across all our business segments. So we are just going to continue to run our business and maintain that approach. So I don't think anything has really changed, David.","David Windley","Great. Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question please","Operator","We are going to take our next question from Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matthew Borsch","Yes. So just hoping you could maybe help us understand how much the impact there was on the medical cost ratio from higher acuity enrollment? I think we can probably do our own math on the growth in the MA Medicaid enrollment relative to commercial. But since you are not giving the commercial MCR anymore, I was just looking for whatever additional insight you could provide on that?","Stephen Hemsley","Again, I think because it really reflects more the reality and the diversity of our business but I don't know if we can give you something that is so precise but Dan, do you want to take a shot?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Matt. Good morning.","Matthew Borsch","Good morning.","Dan Schumacher","So in terms of our care ratios and our performance in the quarter, they were very much in line with our expectation. And then underneath that, as Dave mentioned, we continue to drive very low trends which is why we are orienting towards the lower half of our prior guidance. Obviously, there is impacts associated with the 1.3 million lives we have added over the last 12 months in Medicare, Medicaid, as well as in exchanges which have higher relative care ratios. But maybe if you step back and look at it, we have been able to drive a 20 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a little higher pricing for reform fees, which is helping that offset by a little less development. And when you compare that to the prior year quarter, we did have revenue true-ups in there related to our government programs. So when we look at it on a consolidated basis, it's very much in keeping with our expectations and we have strong confidence in our full year outlook of 80.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","Matthew Borsch","If I could just one quick follow-up on that, you mentioned the prior year development or to prior period development, I noticed you didn't breakout between inner year and prior year, or I missed it. Do you have that?","Dan Schumacher","Yes. It was all current year development.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question please","Operator","And we will take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick from Mizuho. Your line is open.","Sheryl Skolnick","Good morning. Thank you very much and a very nice job again. If we can focus on the Catamaran transaction for a moment since that is something that is going forward and new as opposed to looking backwards as I suspect you would like us to shift our focus, a couple of questions around that. First of all, the new model that you are describing and new value proposition for the OptumRx business in conjunction with Catamaran, can you elaborate a little bit, I heard what you said, Larry, and I understand that you basically trying to change the conversation away from a finite, how much more efficiently can we fill prescriptions, to something that is much more clinically focused and much more targeted at helping the ultimate payers to manage the spend and improve the health of the patient. Can you talk a little bit about why you are doing that now with Catamaran and why you couldn't do that before? That's question number one.","And question number two. Can you set our minds at ease a little bit about how you are thinking about retaining and you have answered this question before, but retaining large-scale customers that Catamaran currently has in the face of the transition to ownership by competing health plan? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","I will let Larry handle the bulk of this, but I would say that OptumRx was clearly on a path to a more comprehensive and integrated approach using data and analytics and engaging in the clinical protocol before - the intensity of that has increased. The advent of specialty pharma has clearly been an element of that and allows us to actually engage it even more effectively as you know. And the only other comment I would offer is, is that we are intensely focused on serving all of our customers and serving the expectations of the Catamaran customers for sure and their expectations. There is significant value coming their way from this combination. And we think that, that is going to be compelling and we are looking to build that business not only for current customers but to expand that business as well.","Larry, would you want to add to that?","Larry Renfro","Sure. So Sheryl, I will come at it a couple of ways. Steve said this and we are laser focused on our customers right now and that's not only customers that we have at Optum, but also when we have the ability to get to the customers of Catamaran. As you know, we are limited right now as the transaction hasn't been approved, so we haven't had a lot of interaction with them yet. But I think that if I looked at the timing on this and what we are trying to do and why we did the transaction, it fits with why I think this is going to work pretty well.","Number one, we needed scale and that's what we are going to have now that we have the volumes that Catamaran brings to this. So scale is going to be there. Obviously, we have been on their technology for 10 years. So this makes it an easy integration and we are going to have enhanced technology that's going to benefit both our organizations. But we get into what Steve was talking about is some distinctive capabilities whether that's the specialty drug side or that\u2019s synchronization.","And if I was looking at that, on the synchronization side, we would be looking at data, modeling, analytics, the things that we do every day, tying that together with our clinical and case management programs and engaging the providers and members. So this is a profound program that we are putting in place at this point around synchronization that Tim Wicks has been working on in OptumRx, that we will now tie in together with Catamaran.","And then the specialty, obviously drug side, we are focused with synchronization being part of that as well as trend management, case management as well as just the purchasing power that with the scale will bring. ","I think the fourth area would be a well-rounded management team. Now we are going to have a very, very strong sales organization, as well as service organization. So that works very well and it's good timing on all this and I think everyone knows that this is a very complementary business. With catamaran, had a big focus on retail where we are on the employer side and government. They are strong in their relationships and sales. We are strong in service. Both are strong in technology. So it's just good timing right now. We believe we can move the dial a bit with the organizations together and I can comment more on this after we get this approved.","Sheryl Skolnick","Great. Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","And I would say that goes along with the broader theme of the cost of the businesses really taking a fresh looks, using information, approaching the marketplace in a more comprehensive and integrated way, engaging local resources to targeted groups so that we can improve their access to care, their use of resources and change their consumer experience as well. So it plays to us across a whole spectrum of areas in pharmaceuticals and specialty pharma is really just one of those themes. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Andy Schenker","Thanks. Good morning. So I appreciate some of your earlier comments here on cost trend in MLRs versus your expectations and maybe if you could just provide any additional color on how maybe the components, their utilization and unit costs are really developing across your book and then remind us how that compares to your initial expectations and related to that one of your peer's highlights on how utilization in Medicare book, specifically anything you are seeing there versus commercial and Medicare? Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Dan, do you want to comment?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Good morning, Andy. This is Dan. I again reiterate that certainly our costs in this quarter were well within our expectation and we continue to drive a low trend, relatively speaking. And I think when you look at the combination of factors that impact it, it starts first with a benefit design that rewards consumers for better choices and then we are aligning it with provider relationships that incentivize more appropriate use of health resources. And then we overlay our medical management on that. And that starts with our people and we have got people in UnitedHealthcare and Optum across facilities, across the country as well as in neighborhoods, as Dave mentioned and in people's home and when we look at the combination of all those things, we have been able to drive a very consistent utilization trend across all our businesses within the UnitedHealthcare portfolio and again, well within our expectations.","So your comments about what you seeing and others around hospital use and so forth, specifically on that, we have not seen anything outside of normal seasonal variation. So it's all in keeping with our expectation. And I think it's important to remember, as we have talked before, we have got a lot of visibility on the hospital side, who is coming in, who is there, who is leaving, how we are interacting with them, facilitating their just discharge and so forth and this is really a strength of our company and we continue to drive absolute reductions in per capita hospital usage and we been talking about that for the last six years.","So again, from our perspective, very much in keeping with our expectations in the quarter, nothing that I would highlight by category or by business, frankly.","Andy Schenker","Dan, if I could just squeeze a quick follow-up in there. You obviously highlight medical management and benefit design. Do you think United is maybe doing better than the overall market as a result of those? Or do think that they are still generally in line with the broader market on some insurance?","Dan Schumacher","I think the combination of the assets that UnitedHealthcare and Optum bring in combination to this marketplace is distinctive.","Andy Schenker","Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Your line is open.","Christine Arnold","Great. Thanks for the question. Your OptumInsight backlog is up significantly. You talked a lot about Optum360. How does the composition of your business change over time? And how might the changing mix of business change earnings growth and seasonality in the future? And then as a second kind of unrelated question, is there anyway to quantify the out of period revenue you experienced a year ago, so we can think about underlying core MLRs? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. Maybe I will have John start the themes and then send that down to a couple of business leads.","John Rex","Good morning, Christine. John Rex here. So just a few thoughts here on the backlog and how that relates to what we see going on in OptumInsight. So a few things here as we talk about the backlog. One of the things that we been noting here is that it continues to be driven by the external business, commercial business that OptumInsight has been successfully gaining. In particular, in driving those increases are, we go back to the theme of the larger, deeper and more comprehensive relationships that we been pursuing for some time. We thought making considerable investments in OptumInsight a couple of years ago and that impacted some of the progression. We spoke about that and tried to highlight that. In particular it was related to those kind of relationships. As they come on, they typically come on and we need to invest. It takes some while to mature and then they start contributing. It's a part of what you are seeing in OptumInsight this year as some of those investments we made a couple of years ago maturing, starting to starting to come online. But our aspiration is to continue to make those and continue to make those in a way that we can balance both our growth that we are looking forward as well as deliver on those commitments.","So I am going to ask Bill Miller to make a few comments and give a little bit more detail in terms of exactly where that's occurring.","Bill Miller","Yes. I think John did a good job at touching on the 360. If I broaden the spectrum a little bit, I think there is three primary factors why you see this pipeline growing and certainly the backlog growing. One, I just think is a very strong focus on our markets, understanding the pressures that are boiling up there, really getting inside of the trend there. And I think we do a really good job of anticipating those trends, which cascades to the next thing as we spent a lot of time with our clients interpreting how these pressures and trends are going to have to be solved for inside of whether they are provider, payer government, life sciences, businesses and so really building with them in concert with them with their input solutions that really help solve and help them thrive in an environment that is becoming more and more performance-based. And I would say, thematically our portfolio is really shape charged for helping our clients move into more of a performance-based environment. And then finally I would say, we execute and deliver. We have great outcomes on the big large end-to-end contracts that we have undertaken but we execute every day on our software solutions, our more standalone solutions and that track record continues to strengthen and the market is recognizing it.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Wright from Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.","Brian Wright","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify, on the higher acuities with the Medicaid and Medicare and the exchanges, I just want to make sure that the exchange MLR is within your expectations as well too.","Stephen Hemsley","I would ask Jeff or Dan, who do you want?","Dan Schumacher","I will have a take, Brian, on the exchanges. Obviously, when we talked about how we are going to approach this market in 2013 and then in 2014 and beyond, our expectation was to get more fully involved this year, which we have done. We have seen some really nice growth. But as we talked about last quarter and we talked coming in, we didn't have an expectation of any meaningful contribution on a margin standpoint. So from a care ratio, it's in keeping with expectations, but obviously higher than what our traditional commercial book would be.","Stephen Hemsley","As expected.","Dan Schumacher","As expected, yes.","Brian Wright","Okay. So nothing out of the ordinary, nothing surprising in what you see?","Jeff Alter","Brian, it's Jeff Alter. No, nothing. As we mentioned, as we were preparing for 2015, we were very purposeful in building both product and networks that supported those price points. And as a matter of fact, we grew where we thought we would grow in the markets that we thought with the products that we thought and we were pleased we actually grew a little more than we expected. So we are pleased with where we are at exchanges and it's a growing, emerging, developing market and we are planning for that as we pace forward.","Brian Wright","And sorry, just be a second, but the better-than-expected growth isn't coming at the cost of worse-than-expected medical cost in that bucket?","Jeff Alter","No, absolutely not. We are growing where we thought we would with the products and the network designs and economics that supported those price points.","Brian Wright","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Gary Taylor","Hi. Good morning. I just had one little nit and then my real question. I think it was Larry who said $42 million of Catamaran merger cost in the first quarter. Is there a 2Q number you have for us?","Larry Renfro","I think that was Dave.","Gary Taylor","Okay.","Stephen Hemsley","There is no meaningful Q2 cost. We recorded the costs associated with the Catamaran merger, the transaction cost in the first quarter.","Gary Taylor","All in the first quarter. Okay. Thank you. So the question I wanted to ask, I am sure you guys saw the CMS announcement last Friday proposing to bundle roughly 25% of Medicare hips and knees in 2016 into a bundled payment methodology. I just wondered if you can maybe talk just for a couple minutes on conceptually your experience with bundled payments on the commercial side? Are you using bundled payments in your ACOs? Or is that more risksharing agreements in capitation? And do you see this, the CMS announcement, as an opportunity to push for more bundled payments in your commercial book?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. Dan, do you want to comment on that?","Dan Schumacher","You bet. Good morning, Gary. So as it relates to our value-based reimbursement in a program, we have talked historically about the continuum working from less progressive to more progressive reimbursement methods and sort of sitting in the middle of that are bundled payments. Today, we deploy them in, if you think about our $36 billion of value-based reimbursement at the end of 2014 or the $43 billion we will have at the end of 2015, we have got about 5% stake in that bundled payments category. And from our perspective, it is a good mechanism along the journey towards a more progressive population orientation around outcomes and value and quality. But at the core, it still doesn't specifically address the volume of utilization. So the number of bundles, right. So as we look at progressing, we are looking to get to more comprehensive alignment around total population cost. It is a piece of productive and positive, but it's just part of a broader solution.","Gary Taylor","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question please","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. I wanted to dig into the two comments you made about guidance. I guess first on 2015, it sounds like all of the revenue number are from Catamaran or the revenue increases are mostly Catamaran, the earnings increase is not. So I just wondered if you could break out what is driving the increase in earnings this year versus your expectations last quarter? And then second, Stephen I think you said that you expect earnings growth to accelerate next year and I just wanted to see if that was due to Catamaran or whether you would make that same comment on a core basis, whether the core United would have grown or growth would have accelerated even without the Catamaran deal?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. I will weigh into this and let Dave deal with specifics particularly around the revenue break. But we are not expecting a contribution from Catamaran at the balance of the year. Basically its earnings will be offset by integration cost, interest expense elements such as that. The improving performance is really historic core businesses and actually UnitedHealthcare has a strong period and a big contributor to that. But the beauty of our construct is that it's a broad-based portfolio and really, the vast majority of the businesses are performing very strongly and we see growing momentum. We clearly expect 2016 to be even stronger year. I think we have been basically have held that posture consistently and that would be in the core business not just Catamaran.","Kevin Fischbeck","But I guess, just no finer point on the 2015 guidance rate? Is it 50-50? Or is one business causing more of the improvement?","Stephen Hemsley","Dave?","Dave Wichmann","Most of the improvement for the guidance for the balance of the year comes from expectations out of UnitedHealthcare. And as for the revenue guidance, you are right, it increased in the quarter but predominantly related to Catamaran. That said, all the businesses improved their revenue forecasts for the balance of the year, just not enough to around up further.","Kevin Fischbeck","Are you saying United is better but you reaffirm the MLR guidance. So what's is driving the UnitedHealthcare better performance?","Dave Wichmann","UnitedHealthcare's performance is predominantly coming from growth. Very strong growth. 1.6 million people year-over-year, 1.4 million for the balance of the year. Very strong growth momentum really commencing about this time last year and actually earlier for Medicaid and for the government programs broadly.","Kevin Fischbeck","Wasn't the 1.4 million, didn't you put out the same number last year, wasn't that your -- in last quarter, wasn't that your guidance for membership this year, last quarter as well?","Dave Wichmann","I think that's right. Yes, that's the same.","Kevin Fischbeck","But you are raising guidance on better growth?","Dave Wichmann","Yes. We are raising guidance on growth and then we were raising guidance $0.10 at the bottom end of the ranges and $0.05 at the top end of the range. And we are raising that guidance based on better visibility on growth and performance in the business.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great.","Dave Wichmann","So translating the slightly stronger revenues on the core businesses and stronger earnings keep earnings efficiencies out of those businesses.","Kevin Fischbeck","All right. Great. Thanks.","Dave Wichmann","Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe I will ask a little more broad question about the Medicare advantage. Obviously the bids are now in for next year. You have now a chance to comment in a big forum like this about your thinking about how that will go for next year and opportunity for margin gains, enrollment that type of thing. Any broad color on that, now that the bids are in?","Stephen Hemsley","I will ask Steve Nelson comment on that. Pretty positive, but obviously at this stage we are not going to give real much precision around next year, but from a thematic point of view, Steve?","Steve Nelson","Sure. Good morning, A.J., it's Steve Nelson. As Steve said, it is obviously too early to be specific. Don't have CMS approval on our benefit submissions yet. But at a high level, we really like how the Medicare Advantage business is positioned for 2016. We are poised to offer stable benefits and distinctive value to both new and existing customers and this is really just at a high-level a result of the work that we have done over the past couple of years to reshape our networks. We introduced premiums more broadly into our membership this year. We have introduced, developed and implemented new and unique customer service model. We call it Advocate4Me. We think it's distinctive. We have more effective clinical models and clinical capabilities in conjunction with our partnership with Optum. And when you couple that with really strong local brand, we really like our position and excited about the growth opportunities in this Medicare Advantage business for 2016.","A.J. Rice","All right. Great. Thanks a lot.","Stephen Hemsley","So really stable across the board. We think it's strengthened the business across the board and very positive. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Peter Costa","Hi. I am hoping you give us some specifics around your MLR this quarter, in particular on three items you have broken out or a couple that you have broken out anyways. The first being the overall mix. What was the actual impact from mix on the MLR this quarter? Second is, what was the impact from the revenue true-ups that you mentioned? And were those favorable or unfavorable true-ups? And I assume some of that relates to the risk adjuster in the New York small group market. And the last question is, your eliminations went up this quarter sequentially, usually they are more flat, except for last year when you were bringing in the PBM revenues, but they were up again this quarter sequentially and I am kind of wondering why they were up and did that have any impact on your MLR this quarter?","Stephen Hemsley","I don't think the eliminations had really any impact, but anyone try to address the other two?","Dave Wichmann","Sure. Peter, we are not going to get into the specifics of spiking out the mix impact on the revenue true-ups. Obviously, if you think about the things influencing the quarter and as you compare to the same quarter last year, on a mix basis, we would have a rising care ratio just based on greater orientation to Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and exchange enrollment. Revenue true-ups I referenced earlier, so in last year's second quarter, we recognize government-based revenue true-ups which were favorable. So as you look at the comps year-over-year, that would be something that we will be working against that comparison on a year-over-year basis.","And then as you look at the second quarter this year, on the revenue side, we had expected in the commercial business to be receivers on the risk adjustment and we did a little bit better risk adjustment on the commercial business in the second quarter related to 2014. So those are the things that are all coming together, but when you step back from it we have seen a decline in our care ratio on a consolidated basis year-over-year. Our medical costs are in line with our expectations and our trends are trending towards the lower half of the guidance that we have provided previously. So as we look at the second quarter, it is very much in line with what we were thinking before we get into it and as we exit it, we have confidence of balance of the year.","Stephen Hemsley","And last year was affected by the true-ups.","Dave Wichmann","Yes. It was last year.","Peter Costa","Okay. And then, just a follow-up. Why did the eliminations go up sequentially this quarter?","Stephen Hemsley","Dave, you want to take?","Dave Wichmann","Peter, they go up as UnitedHealthcare grows, so too does Optum because UnitedHealthcare is obviously a customer of Optum. So when you look at them, you will actually see that Optum's overall growth rate is growing at a faster rate than the eliminations, if you will, which suggests that Optum is going faster externally than they are through the internal business with UnitedHealthcare, which is the case. But they are going to continue to rise as UnitedHealthcare continues to grow at these rates.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question please.","Operator","We take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. First, just a quick clarification and then a question. The clarification, just you guys don't talk about cash earnings, but I was curious if you could give us what your estimates for cash earnings EPS guidance would be this year? And the $0.30 that you talked about for Catamaran, I just want to make sure that's a GAAP number and I guess, maybe what would be the cash estimate? And then real question just around the national accounts business we are getting for July here, I am curious what you are seeing for 2016? Any changes in the competitive dynamics? Have you guys thought about different strategies for sales in light of what's perceived to be industry [indiscernible]?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. I will have Dave do the earnings and Jeff can comment on the national business.","Dave Wichmann","Yes. So Josh, we maybe unique in this regard, but we only report numbers on a GAAP basis. So in every case they include the application of the amortization of intangibles which are pretty consistent in our business. If you look at 2015, the effects on EPS would be about $0.34 per share, if you look back to 2014, it would be the same $0.34 per share and yes, the forward view on 2016 accretion for Catamaran was a GAAP base number as well.","Josh Raskin","And Dave, so what would the cash accretion be on Catamaran next year?","Dave Wichmann","Catamaran will carry about $0.20 of amortization per year.","Josh Raskin","Okay. Perfect.","Stephen Hemsley","Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Good morning, Josh. It's Jeff Alter. So we had a really strong 2015 national account season and that momentum is continuing. We have been very purposeful in focusing on our customer's needs to deliver a total reduction in cost for them. So the partnership that we been able to create with our existing clients and with bringing Optum resources to the table have resonated in that market. As far as 2016 goes, right now, it's improved over where we were in 2015. We have got a couple of new strategic wins already booked. Some growth in existing clients in slices of business that we didn't have and we have retained today all our key clients that we have to bid. We will give you more clarity as the season wraps up during our next call.","Josh Raskin","Okay. That's helpful Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sean Wieland","Thank you very much. What percent of your members are predominantly inside the United tent? That is, they get their medical benefits from United, their pharmacy benefits from OptumRx, they engage with Optum health services? And can you comment on what the medical cost ratio is of this subset of members versus your average?","Stephen Hemsley","We are not going to provide cost ratios with respect to that, but we will give a sense of other.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Hi, Sean. It's Dan Schumacher. Your question, assuming its oriented towards the large customers, right, because if you look into our fully insured offering down market, we have full and total pull through of all Optum care, disease management, pharmacy clinical analytics, data and so forth in managing those population. So looking up market, the UnitedHealthcare national accounts block, we have about a third of them have pharmacy through OptumRx, so two-thirds represent an opportunity for us as an enterprise. As you think about the other services, the vast majority of them have care management, disease management and other engagement routines through Optum. So the only one where we have less penetration is around pharmacy.","Stephen Hemsley","Then on the on the last piece of it, Sean, the only thing I might comment is, is that when you take a look at the across the cohort of clients and then take a look at the clients that really embrace the kind of the more maximum of the offerings that we have from both UnitedHealthcare and from Optum, those clients tend to actually have performance levels that are superior. So when a client is progressively lean towards the more modern approaches that we are offering, as Dan and Jeff have described before in terms of designs, engagements of the consumer, the clinical programs to the use of the high performing networks that are incentive-based, incentives on both ends, their performance from a cost trend point of view, from a satisfaction point of view tend to be stronger.","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question is from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Ana Gupte","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So one question I had was, there is obviously angst around MLR, but you are reaffirming your guidance. Have you any thoughts or suggestions for the street around how the seasonal variation should be looked at now with exchanges, with MA, any other changes in one small group and so on?","Stephen Hemsley","I really don't think so. I really think the question really comes round mix and it is really more the mix of the membership from where the growth does come from and the higher care ratio category. I really think it's as simple as that.","Ana Gupte","And then just a follow-up on that question. On the small-group, which is becoming ACA compliant from 50 to 100, how do you see that playing out for 2016? And may be if there is early renewals we had some volatility last year, what are you seeing in the marketplace? Might that actually create more stability or would the risk pool estimation might there be any issues?","Stephen Hemsley","Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Good morning, Ana. It's Jeff Alter. What we are preparing for and expecting is very similar to what happened in the fourth quarter of 2013 when there was transitional relief in some early renewal programs for two to 50 block. We assume that will happen again this year in the 51 to 99 and we are ready for it. We are geared up with products and other offerings to serve what those clients might want to do when transitional relief for early renewal programs are offered.","Ana Gupte","Thanks for taking the questions.","Stephen Hemsley","So maybe perhaps one more question. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Tom Carroll from Stifel.","Tom Carroll","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So somewhat related to Josh's question, with all the action, if you will, in the managed care space, do you think that employee benefit consultants and brokers may give United a stronger look into 2016 than they might otherwise? And maybe conversely asking another way, are you guys perhaps being any more proactive with these sales sources and highlighting your focus relative to others into next year? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","I think I can address that. First of all, as we said, we are not going to comment on market dynamics that are driven by anything other than the prevailing market dynamics. Always looking for more value, always looking for more innovation and so forth. And I really do believe the momentum of our business has been advancing our capabilities, have been advancing and we are engaging the market as productively as we ever have been. And we are continuing to focus on that, serving customers and really responding to them and we are seeing some of that in the results in terms of retention, the response to our offerings, the broader penetration of offerings to customers. We are just going to keep on that. And I think that's the best response. We have been on it. We are going to continue to stay on it. And I think the market has been in flux and looking for value and so we are just going to stay on it.","So with that, we will conclude. Thank you for your questions this morning. As always, this interaction is helpful in framing or speaking around information we offer you and we do our Investor Conference. That will be coming up again in New York City on December 1. So we would ask you to hold that date on your calendars and we will make sure that that is a substantive engagement for all of you.","And to wrap up, through the first half of 2015, UnitedHealth Group. Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered an advance in momentum and strong growth in revenues, in earnings, in cash flows and the number of people and customers we serve and we expect this growth to continue and accelerate in 2016 and beyond. As I said, we remain focused on further improving service, cultivating and expanding our capabilities and market positions, introducing practical innovations and the potential to make healthcare work even better. So thank you and we will see you next quarter.","Operator","This does conclude today's program.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Earnings Reports & SEC Filings section of the Company\u2019s Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 15, 2019, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company\u2019s website.","I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.","David Wichmann","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today.","The 325,000 dedicated people of UnitedHealth Group made measurable progress again this quarter in developing the next generation health system, aligned to achieve better health outcomes at lower costs and improved patient and care provider experiences, increasing health care value for everyone, one person at a time.","In turn, we delivered strong, well-balanced revenue and earnings growth across our business. Total revenues through the first three quarters of this year grew 8% year-over-year or $13.4 billion to $181 billion, and adjusted earnings per share advanced 17% to $11.22. Operating cash flows were $12.3 billion or 1.2 times net earnings. Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum contributed strongly to these results.","Based on this year\u2019s year-to-date performance, we have increased our outlook for full year 2019 adjusted earnings to a range of $14.90 to $15 per share.","As always, we are focused on operating our businesses, lowering health care costs for people, advancing quality and the consumer experience, building on our strategic growth platforms, and driving innovative change and societal returns at scale, all designed to achieve the full and unique growth potential of this enterprise.","We have a strong track record of thriving in fluid environments similar to the one we find ourselves in today. We are uniquely diverse with significant experience and weight in every aspect of health care, Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial coverages, in both at risk and self-funded forms with considerable presence in health care services including high-value health care delivery at emerging scale, all across the United States. These are substantial, fast-growing businesses, not new initiatives. This diversity, combined with a conscious adaptability orientation, allows us to consistently perform for the people we serve, and for you, our investors, through a wide and ever-changing spectrum of environmental conditions.","Our growth agenda is purpose built to align with the changes necessary to develop the next generation, more modern and effective health system. We are reinventing health care delivery, now directly serving 25 million patients in 35 local U.S. markets and in South America; transforming pharmacy care services, driving transparent, digitally enabled, high-quality plan designs at lower costs with more consumer responsive point-of-sale discounts, saving nearly $2,000 per person per year on average. Accelerating digital, our consumer digital platform, serving nearly 20% of the U.S. population by January 2020, is being extended to include proprietary, deeply personalized next best action recommendations within portable medical records maintained real-time for nearly 50 million Americans and their doctors. Engagement strategies and incentives around this data hold the potential to achieve double-digit cost of care reductions. And advancing consumer-centric benefits. Our Bind, NexusACO, Allsavers and Harmony products are beginning to gain considerable traction in the commercial markets this fall. And our Medicare Advantage and Dual offerings are well-positioned to again drive distinctive growth from the differentiated value we deliver to people.","Our relentless focus on quality, experiences and costs is increasingly apparent. Our NPS levels have never been higher; we just completed our regular three-year Medicare audit with exceptional results; expected members in 4 Stars or greater plans for 2021 payment year are at an all-time high of 84% at UHC and a consistently strong 92% at Optum. Every one of our Medicaid states are referenceable. Our overall per capita health care cost trends have averaged well below 4% for the past half decade, even as we\u2019ve expanded MA benefits, and our operating costs continue to come in line, preserving consumer premiums for medical care. I could go on. You should get a sense today that our business is progressing across multiple dimensions with many of our growth and performance efforts beginning to fall in place.","Higher quality, better outcomes and experiences, lower costs, building the next generation health system in a socially conscious way, these have been and will continue to be the consistent themes for our enterprise, an enterprise built for growth.","So, with confidence, I turn you to our exceptional business leaders for updates on our businesses and financial results and expectations, starting with Andrew Witty, CEO of Optum.","Andrew Witty","Thank you, Dave.","An aging population, increasing numbers of people with multiple chronic conditions, and the rise of increasingly costly therapies, most notably specialty medicines and gene therapy are all challenges to achieving a simpler, more cost-effective health system. Optum is addressing these areas through applied technologies, distinctive clinical expertise and an intense focus on improving the consumer and physician experience, all underpinned by an unparalleled set of assets, with far-reaching data transformed into information by powerful analytic tools and deployed throughout the health system. We\u2019re making the system more transparent and simpler while bringing our core capabilities even more closely together to provide more fully integrated solutions and advance higher quality outcomes at a lower cost.","OptumRx is treating patients holistically, aligning pharmacy, medical and behavioral health needs using data and evidence-based protocols to enable end-to-end management of care. This approach has been honed over several years now and is making a meaningful difference for patients and customers.","This includes deepening our capacity to serve people who need high-cost specialty drugs, including convenient, higher-quality and less costly access to specialty pharmaceuticals through direct delivery of infusion services. The number of patients we support with these services has more than doubled to 60,000 over the last five years and we expect this number to more than triple over the next five years. Realized savings are 30% to 50% per infusion versus an inpatient setting, with comparable quality.","OptumInsight continues to fuel a rapid technology and information innovation agenda across both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Its increasingly diverse spectrum of best-in-industry capabilities are driving strong growth in backlog for an expanding client list of health systems, governments, health plans and other health system participants with broader solutions sets, such as those offered in the John Muir Health announcement last quarter. Business momentum is accelerating as these solutions extend the positive impact OptumInsight is having on the cost and quality of the care experience.","But, today, I\u2019d like to focus on how OptumCare, the largest part of OptumHealth is positively impacting the health system. OptumCare works to form modern local health systems that are physician-led, technology-enabled and integrated to deliver the lowest total cost of care, with exceptional outcomes and a better patient and physician experience. We empower primary care doctors with insights and information by focusing on proactive, preventative medicine. We surround them with select high-performing specialists and provide in-home and outpatient services to care for people at the optimal site of service.","We understand care delivery is an intensely local experience. So, I\u2019d like to provide a few examples of how OptumCare and our full range of capabilities are developing and delivering at a local level.","Southern Nevada is among our most developed geographies and continues to grow rapidly. Our physician base there has expanded by nearly 60% just since 2016. Our doctors are fully supported by Optum data, analytics, technology and a single medical record, allowing them to deliver exceptional care to more than 300,000 people, 85% of whom are in capitation arrangements. In the commercial population, our total cost of care is more than 10% lower than the competition. In Medicare Advantage nearly all plans are 4-Star with cost trends averaging well less than 1% per year over the last two years and with HEDIS quality measurements 20% better than peers.","In Southern California, we are creating the most comprehensive accountable care platform in the region, now serving 1.5 million people through value-based arrangements, nearly triple the 2016 levels. Our OptumCare platform in Southern California serves 30 payers through a network of aligned physicians, 100 clinics and our nearly 30 ambulatory surgery centers. With our geographic presence and integrated open system of care, we recently co-created with UnitedHealthcare a distinctive product called Harmony that provides a seamless experience by uniting care and coverage, achieving 20% savings for people as compared to UnitedHealthcare\u2019s comparable coverage offerings.","In Texas, our nationally recognized physician groups continue to deliver superior outcomes for patients, care providers and benefit sponsors. This has enabled us to expand across the state from a single geography in San Antonio to communities like Dallas, Austin and Houston. In 2020, we expect to serve more than 500,000 people in value-based care relationships across Texas, up from 200,000 in 2016. This advanced clinical model is producing a Medicare Advantage medical trend that runs at one-half the national average.","Finally, in New Jersey, a newer stage region, we are taking major steps forward to augment and align with other OptumCare assets, integrating MedExpress urgent care centers and partnering our ambulatory surgery centers to create a more seamless experience for patients. Our advanced offerings deliver more than 15% lower total cost of care than peers in the commercial market and approximately 10% in Medicaid. Since 2016 our OptumCare practice in New Jersey has grown its physician base by 60% and the number of consumers served has increased by 70%.","To summarize, we are growing our physician base, applying data analytics and technologies, advancing collaboration, driving distinctive quality, and serving diverse payers to improve health outcomes at lower costs. We will further expand and deepen our local presence, aligning and integrating our capabilities across OptumCare as well as Optum more broadly in areas, including specialty pharmacy, behavioral health services and community-based pharmacy dispensaries. All this to improve clinical quality, consumer and physician experiences and cost structures in a growing number of OptumCare regions, leading to growth and earnings performance.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dirk McMahon, CEO of UnitedHealthcare.","Dirk McMahon","Thank you, Andrew.","UnitedHealthcare and Optum share a vision for creating a better health system, one that delivers greater value to consumers, customers and society as a whole. Fulfilling that mission depends significantly on making health care more affordable. Lowering costs is the pivotal element to improving and sustaining access, even as we enhance quality. We have a multi-faceted agenda to do this. Let me share with you a few focus areas from UnitedHealthcare\u2019s perspective.","There is considerable excess spending on care delivered in sub-optimal, high-cost settings that can and should be provided in higher-quality, consumer-responsive, and more cost-effective sites. In our commercial business alone we see opportunity to shift well more than 20% of our medical spend to these more effective sites.","For example, there is significant opportunity for more hip and knee replacement procedures to be performed in ambulatory centers, with those settings often having a 50% cost advantage over traditional settings and with fully comparable, if not better, safety and quality. Similarly, we are better optimizing the settings for delivery of imaging procedures and we\u2019re beginning to provide significant savings by enabling specialty drugs to be administered through alternate sites. We are rapidly expanding this approach to additional high-cost services that would be part of our site of service efforts by the end of this year. We expect these efforts to deliver $0.5 billion in savings in 2020 for our customers.","The data on affordability and access is also clear with respect to high-performing physicians and health systems. We know high-performing providers as measured by health outcomes and adherence to scientific, evidence-based medicine provide care for people at 7% lower total costs. Across our businesses, this is a $9 billion annual savings opportunity.","Our product and network designs increasingly emphasize these high-performing care providers who share philosophies on improving quality and the patient experience, while reducing the total cost of care. Using the individual health record and advanced referral capabilities as our foundation, we are designing products and aligning incentives to include full clinical and financial accountability with care providers who are capable of performing to both upside and downside measures. Innovative new products, like Harmony, which Andrew mentioned earlier, is a good example.","There is also significant potential to better transition patients from acute to post-acute care settings. Over the past year, we\u2019ve deployed new technology that analyzes millions of data points to help physicians arrive at the specific care setting that\u2019s optimal for an individual\u2019s unique circumstance. On average, we realize nearly a 10% reduction in unnecessary readmissions by selecting the most appropriate clinical setting for the unique needs of the patient.","And as always, we are focused on reducing the cost of administering health care and ensuring system integrity. Technology is enabling these efforts. We\u2019re investing in digital tools to support doctors, reducing their administrative burden while improving efficiency and affordability across the system. For example, care provider phone calls to us have decreased nearly 10% this year, thanks to these digital investments. Our productivity and automation efforts this year and next should save us over $1 billion. And our fraud, waste and abuse program should save customers more than $1 billion next year as well.","As you can tell, we are highly focused on improving the value we deliver for people and our clients by modernizing our approaches and reducing the total cost of care while providing greater access to high-quality care through new, more innovative products and services. These actions all lead to greater value for people and growth of our businesses.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to John Rex, CFO of UnitedHealth Group.","John Rex","Thank you, Dirk.","In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 7% and operating earnings grew 9%, the latter led by the Optum businesses. We saw broad strength across most of the enterprise, and the opportunities to grow and serve more people at ever higher levels of value continue to expand.","At UnitedHealthcare, revenue growth was led by Medicare & Retirement, with seniors served in Medicare Advantage increasing by 315,000 over last year, nearly 450,000 when dually eligible members are added. UnitedHealthcare revenue growth of 5% was impacted by the health insurance tax deferral and withdrawal from the Iowa Medicaid program.","Medical costs remain well-controlled. We now see 2019 commercial trend running in the lower half of the range we originally outlined late last year. Cost trends across our government programs remain in the low single digits.","The financial performance of our Medicaid business continues to improve, while the pacing is slower than originally anticipated, as we work closely with our state partners to ensure Medicaid rates are set to sustainable levels. We are deeply committed to these programs, as they are the most effective way to provide access to quality care for millions of Americans, importantly those most in need. We expect our performance to continue to steadily improve in 2020.","The Optum businesses are performing at high levels and remain uniquely positioned to improve overall health system performance. Each delivered double-digit earnings growth in the third quarter. OptumHealth revenue per consumer served grew 30% as the scope and intensity of services provided increased, this largely due to the continued development of OptumCare.","OptumInsight backlog grew 21% to $19 billion, led by growth in operations and technology, revenue cycle management, and payer services. At OptumRx, adjusted scripts grew 4% excluding the transition of a single large account. OptumRx continues to achieve strong gains across multiple markets, as its value proposition resonates with customers.","Operating cash flows remain strong at $12.3 billion through the first nine months of this year or 1.2 times net earnings. And our balance sheet remains well-positioned for continued capital deployment to the businesses and return of capital to shareholders, with a market leading dividend.","Our strong year-to-date results lead us to raise our full year 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings to a range of $14.90 to $15 per share, at the mid-point an increase of $0.40 per share from the initial outlook we provided late last year.","In summary, our diversified growth, focus on cost management and strategic capital allocation are combining to produce another strong year of performance.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave.","David Wichmann","Thank you, John.","Standing back, you perhaps sense that the things coming into place across Optum, UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group translate into real and sustaining value to consumers and customers and ultimately distinguished growth for our business and returns for shareholders. As you know, at this time of the year, we typically offer some early thoughts on performance for the coming year. We are approaching 2020 with optimism, particularly given the enterprise-wide commitment to translate the value of this evolving, next generation health system into market growth in tangible ways.","Understandably your attention has also begun to shift to next year. And we have observed that a handful of the more recently updated estimates are now starting to center on the more typical prudent posture we would expect, at this distance, as a starting point for core adjusted earnings per share performance, this nearer to the lower end of our 13% to 16% long-term performance we remain committed to achieving.","To this starting point, we apply the impact of the health insurance tax, which for us should approximate $0.50 per share year-over-year, $0.35 of this attributed to in-year 2020. And in keeping with our normal practice, we exclude the accretive impact of additional strategic capital allocation, primarily M&A, over the balance of 2019 and into 2020. As is custom, we will provide a detailed look at 2020 performance expectations at our December 3 investor conference and as always, endeavor to outperform as we progress through 2020.","We remain committed to growing our business and developing the next generation, patient-centric health system, with an aim towards driving considerable societal returns and distinguished growth. That\u2019s how our business operates and will continue to operate every day.","Operator, let's open it up for questions. One question per caller please, so we can get to as many as possible. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate your early commentary on 2020. So, I wanted to follow up there. You talked about being at the lower end of the 13% to 16% growth rates that you target over the long-term ex the half. Can you share with us kind of what the key drivers of that are and why you think close -- the starting point closer to the low end is where we should target, given what looks like pretty significant momentum going into 2020?","David Wichmann","Fair question, Justin. I appreciate it. I think, as you know, our posture, at this time of the year and at this distance from 2020, tends to be more conservative. And, as you know, we also at this time try to avoid giving specific guidance on the call. So, what we're really trying to do is give a pathway for a consensus to form relative to our own views. And as suggested, we think it's a reasonable and prudent position at this distance to censor your initial expectations of core operating performance, if I may use that word, near to the lower end of our long-term 13% to 16% growth rate, and then apply the HIT where we've provided a point estimate of $0.50 year-over-year $0.35 attributed to 2020.","And then, I'd be sure when you -- then to put a range around that something like plus or minus $0.15 or so. That's the way that we would form and what you would likely expect us to come out with in December. All these expectations are without the deployment of strategic capital, additional strategic capital through the balance of 2019 and into 2020. So, the things that we've done, the transactions like an Equian as an example have been fully considered as we provide this guidance. But as you know, we're persistently putting together assets in the marketplace to drive solutions, to drive better results for people on the cost, quality and patient experience standpoint. So, those are the platforms that we will continue to develop the four or five or so that I referenced in my prepared remarks.","In terms of headwinds for us. As we look at, we're always deeply respectful of medical costs. Also, the sufficiency of government funding, particularly in the Medicaid population -- Medicaid markets. In particular, as that continues to expand, it becomes even a larger line item on the budgets of individual states. And so, it's something that needs to be persistently managed and we need to make sure is adequately set.","The HIT of course is coming back or the health insurance tax, which is unfortunate, given that healthcare already costs too much and be adding this burden on top of all that. But it obviously comes back and we tried to size that for you as well. And then, I'd say this thing that you may miss in all of this is the pacing of investments. And things like NPS, which we\u2019ve shown good progress in growth. The development and release of products and building new platforms is expensive.","We have a lot of startup costs for our OptumCare businesses. They start as breakeven; we drive them into losses by expanding -- reducing panel size and expanding the resources available so that these become risk-bearing entities over time. And then, the new business platforms, as I discussed, like Bind and et cetera. So, those are the kinds of things that in particular that maybe cause a little bit of a difference between what you might have felt in terms of momentum and the -- where we're at. And these are just investments like we've said in each of the last two years and the decade before that that this Company persistently makes in order to drive that kind of a 13% to 16% long-term growth rate over time. Thank you for your question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. Question is just on the MA competitive environment for 2020, and now that the landscape data has been released. And so, if you can talk about how you feel about your relative competitive positioning, and then also whether you feel like the overall pricing environment is getting more competitive in the Medicare Advantage market for next year? Thanks.","David Wichmann","I think, we're pretty bullish on it, Scott. But, I\u2019ll let Brian Thompson discuss this.","Brian Thompson","Hi, Scott. Brian Thompson here. Thanks for the question. I would say that we're very pleased with our offerings and how the market is shaping up for 2020. I will say our first goal each and every year is to make sure that we don't disrupt the benefits and coverage that our seniors have come to expect, regardless of the headwinds that we have to face in particular, the return of the tax year in 2020. I'd say that we\u2019ve not only accomplished that, but I'd also say that in many respects, we\u2019ve strengthened the benefits and the value that we will offer in 2020. And the feedback from the broker community has been very positive. We like how our offerings are stocking up in the marketplace and we\u2019re optimistic about what seniors will see as they begin their annual enrollment as early as this morning. So, looking forward again, very optimistic about the marketplace and our position in it for UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage offerings in 2020.","Operator","Next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Dave Windley","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Shifting to commercial. Dave, in your opening remarks, you commented about several product areas that were gaining traction in commercial this fall. The enrollment number in the quarter was pretty positive. I wondered if those were related, and if you can elaborate a little bit on that traction.","David Wichmann","Yes. Kind of two unrelated thoughts. I\u2019ll let Dirk respond to the latter. But as it relates to the former, we're seeing Bind gain considerable traction in the market. And I think, it should be a nice contributor to us for 2020 and beyond. I think that product feature, which is on-demand health care is beginning to resonate more effectively with the marketplace overall. Then, our NexusACO offerings is something we've had for a while. But, as is the case of ACOs, they\u2019ve had to be [stripped] [ph] down over time to make those performance-based networks more effective. And so, that is starting to gain nice traction. And we had a nice win here this fall with respect to that. Dirk, do you want to touch on\u2026?","Dirk McMahon","Yes. Our fully insured gain in the quarter was largely, because of our M&A efforts. If you look organically, we're basically flat quarter-over-quarter. In the ASO space, we had a nice quarter, we grew 140,000 members. So, we\u2019re positive on that for the quarter. As we look in 2020, going back to fully insured, we're going to continue to balance enrollment growth and our margin expectations to retain the groups and attract long-term business that produce sustainable business for us. So, we're pretty bullish on what happened in the quarter from enrollment perspective.","David Wichmann","The only thing I might add to that, David just so you have it is that we started out of gates pretty slow on the full risk business in the commercial markets, both in the employer and the individual. And the team\u2019s done a nice job of moderating that off throughout the year. And we've seen some progress to that extent. And we just have -- we have more work to do to continue to grow that part of the business. But, we're pleased with the moderation that's occurred and look forward to getting it to grow.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Hi. Please clarify if my math is wrong. But, my question is, if I take 13% growth off of the 14.95 sort of midpoint, maybe reduce that 14.95 by I guess $0.15 would be the amount that you're saying is tailwind from the HIT this year. So, I\u2019d say start at 14.80, grow by 13% and then subtract the $0.35 for next year from the HIT itself. That gives I guess you a midpoint of 16.37 for next year. And so, that's a $1.42 of improved earnings. How much of that $1.42 if my math was correct is dependent on the Medicaid business improvement?","David Wichmann","I don't know that we'll comment specifically on that. The only thing I would add to the math, which if I'm following it is that I would put a range around that, which is -- would be classic for us to put a typical range around the math. Medicaid is making progress, made progress in the back half of 2018, is making progress, nice progress in 2019, not just financially, but all of the -- what I would characterize as the quality elements of it have firmed up and improved quite a bit. And I'd say, the elements around networks and cost containments and things of that nature have -- they made progress on that as well. And we would expect it to continue to make progress into next year as well. But, we expect contributions from all of our businesses. You'll see a healthy dose of that coming from Optum, which continues to generate a lot of momentum and will drag that into 2020 as well. And you'll see it across the UnitedHealthcare businesses broadly as well. And we'll be pleased to offer additional guidance on that and in good detail when we have our investor conference on December 3rd in New York City.","Operator","The next question is for Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Borsch","Maybe if I could just continue on that. I realize you're not saying very much on 2020 and you want to keep it that way. But just to understand, when you talk about M&A being excluded, the accretion from M&A being excluded from where you would start out for 2020, is that -- are you pointing to a future source of additional earnings that you would, in the normal course of what you do, expect to get or is that something that's coming off of what you've already done for this year?","David Wichmann","I would never say any expectations around earnings related to M&A that\u2019s either unannounced or not closed. So, that is really what we're trying to communicate there. It would be the accretion or if for whatever reason and we have done dilutive transactions as well that set foundations for us to have long-term growth. It might include that as well. But, what you've typically seen from the Company is this generates about two-thirds of its earnings profile from organic means and the other third through the deployment of capital. That's been pretty consistent for us for at least the two decades that I've been here. Kind of a hallmark of the Company in the way in which it thinks about assembling capabilities and market presence, so that it can better serve people. So, those are the -- that's really what we're trying to signal there is -- that this time last year or maybe at our investor conference last year, we gave an original range of guidance, which is $0.40 less than the revised guidance we just gave you today. Part of that was just because of stronger performance on the organic front. But another part of that was because of the deployment of capital. So, what is typical for us is to set reasonable expectations at this level, more prudent ones, and then to continue to execute. And as situations arise, raise our guidance going forward.","Matthew Borsch","If I could ask just one follow-up on that. You normally also start out with a range, and it does include some level of assumed share repurchases. So, there is typically some allocation of capital that you start off with, unless your methodology is changing.","David Wichmann","Yes. You can assume that the range at which you get to for core operating performance would include a normal dose or allocation of share repurchase capital, as well as a dividend and the number of other things that we utilize our capital for.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. Good morning, here with Mr. Percher as well. Our question is around the President's executive order a couple of weeks ago around mostly Medicare, but specifically interested in your views around potential changes to Medicare Advantage with the opportunity to provide even more additional supplemental benefits. And then there were some conversation around allowing seniors to participate in the savings in the program. It sounded like that was centered on the rebate. So, I'm just curious in your perspectives on the evolution of Medicare Advantage, what you guys are positioning for in the future and sort of how you think that executive order will impact theoretically 2021 and beyond?","David Wichmann","Maybe I'll start and then ask Brian Thompson to carry on, if I don't -- if I leave him any oxygen. First of all, Medicare Advantage is a very strong performing product, at least for us. It's a product that delivers cost savings to seniors and closes essential gaps that they would otherwise have on original Medicare. And at least for us, we are -- our Medicare Advantage product reduces the Part A, B benefit cost by 25% or so, and even more so when you connect UnitedHealthcare to an OptumCare enterprise where the higher performing ones reduce it by as much as 35%. So, there is a very strong value proposition. And what I hope is inherent in the executive order is continuing to throw confidence behind that high-performing product, which serves 22 million seniors today in a very strong way. The other thing I'd say about it is that our NPS is -- continues to grow in that category. And so, I think seniors are very pleased with the product.","Did I leave you anything, Brian?","Brian Thompson","Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. Again, I think, just echoing what Dave said, we're really pleased with what we heard in the executive order, some of the elements inside that or what we've been advocating for to make the program even stronger for the seniors in America today. Flexibility around product design for specific conditions, the use of incentives to drive better adherence and better health and certainly just promoting MA and driving better education and awareness for the benefits that it can provide, all were inside that executive order. So, we're certainly encouraged by not only the popularity of the program today but the sentiments that would suggest momentum going forward. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. I was just hoping to get some early progress on the DMG integration and also your thoughts around its ability to be accretive to 2020? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Wyatt?","Wyatt Decker","Great. Thank you very much for the question. Yes, we're very pleased with OptumHealth to be creating the nation's leading value-based patient centric medical system. The close of DMG in June was an exciting event for us. And the ongoing integration, both culturally and bringing our tools and services to the operations of DaVita Medical Group have gone quite well so far. So, we're quite optimistic and positive about the overall impact of DMG to OptumHealth and Optum in 2020. Thank you.","David Wichmann","That's Dr. Wyatt Decker for those of you don't know. Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","And we'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes. Could you talk a little bit about medical costs in the quarter? And I was interested in, what was turning out a little better than expected in the commercial trends and basically how Medicaid was performing on an MLR basis and things like reverification?","John Rex","So, as you know, we don't go into the details of the individual businesses within UnitedHealthcare. But, Jeff, do you want to give some color on -- Jeff Putnam, CFO of UnitedHealthcare, do you want to give us some color on what's going on?","Jeff Putnam","Yes. Thanks for the question. As we mentioned, we continue to see costs very well controlled and cost trend consistent with expectations now as John noted in the lower half of the 6% range, plus or minus 50 basis points, and as we also noted, government business is tracking well in the low single digits. Unit costs continue to be the largest driver. And when you look at it by category, all the categories we typically talk about are still in our ranges, but outpatient and physician are a little bit lower than our initial projections. Inpatient remains consistent with our projections that we continue to see now decade-long trend of flat to declining bed days and admissions.","David Wichmann","We're pretty pleased with our performance on managing medical costs. As you know, we have a lot -- we as an industry and we UnitedHealth Group, have a lot of work to do to bring these down to even more affordable levels. Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could just comment on the 2020 sort of competitive dynamics in the commercial markets, thinking both group risk as well as ASO, and maybe any early expectations for member growth or your disposition as you approach the selling season for both those sides of the business. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Dirk McMahon, CEO of UnitedHealthcare?","Dirk McMahon","Yes. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. So, I'll start with ASO. As I mentioned, we had a good quarter in the third quarter with 140,000 members worth of growth. As we look into 2020, we had a few national account losses. We actually had to defend more for one 1, 1, 20 than we did in prior years. We don't expect those losses to have any material impact on earnings. But, as we look into 2021, we're already into the midst of that selling season. We've already had a big win, and the pipeline is shaping up nicely.","On the fully insured products, what we see in the marketplace is, it's typically competitive environment, some pockets more competitive than others, but we continue to be very respectful of our trend, we will stick to our longstanding disciplines of pricing to our forward cost and we think we have competitive products across the Board, and we're looking forward to the selling season and the upcoming buying season for 1, 1 for fully insured.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Good morning. Question is focused on OptumRx margins of 5.2. I think exceeded expectations that you set up in when you guided back in 2018. So, what drove the margin offset and the performance this quarter? And as we think about 2020, considering the new business that you're bringing on board, how should we think about that margin trajectory for next year?","David Wichmann","Good question, Ricky. John Prince, CEO of OptumRx?","John Prince","Good morning, Ricky. John Prince. Thank you for the question. In terms of the margin, we're comfortable with our expectations sort of short-term and our long-term guidance. As you know, OptumRx is a portfolio of pharmacy care services businesses. So, in addition to our benefit management, we also have a platform of infusion and community-based pharmacies like Genoa, specialty, e-commerce, et cetera. As those businesses continue to grow, that's driving our margin mix. So, that is probably the biggest change, and what affects our margin over time is the mix of our underlying services that we're providing. We're also investing in our portfolio that are experiencing significant growth. We've shown significant growth in all of our platforms in the services side, especially in the specialty business and infusion.","So, I think we're setting up pretty well in terms of hitting our expectations on margin. And then, the deals that we've won, we've been very successful in the selling piece for 2020. That does not affect our long-term guidance for margin.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Yes. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Dave, I think at the beginning, you talked about your digital platform here. And I think you mentioned something like you think you can deliver double-digit cost reductions, and later you guys mentioned seeing a $1 billion in productivity savings from digital efforts. Is that something that you've been able to market to potential clients for 2020 or is that something you're talking about that's going to be rolling on and how much of that would you expect to deliver declines versus we could expect to fall to the bottom line? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Andrew Witty, CEO of Optum?","Andrew Witty","Yes. Charles, thanks very much for the question. So, digital is clearly a significant element of the mix that we're putting together. We\u2019re very much convinced that we need to make sure that we've gotten integrated healthcare offering both physically, obviously, centered around OptumCare and the ambulatory assets of OptumRx, but then really empowered by digital. If you look at Rally, it\u2019s one example; it\u2019s one of our main platforms. We've seen some significant wins during the second half of this year in business outside of the UHG Group. We now see that platform been available to about one in five Americans overall on the same significant uplift, particularly in areas like Rally Advantage where since the beginning of this year, we've had nearly 400,000 new unique users come on to that platform actively using it. So, it's a big area for us. I'd say we're still in the early days though, but with full potential of digital combining together with the rest of our portfolio of services, and we're very optimistic about it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. We've been running the math on the Medicaid enrollment, and if we take out the contract updates, it looks like the impact of the industry-wide trend of shrinkage of state eligible roles had a very minimal impact sequentially. So, I'm wondering if you think that that swooning process is over. And can you update us on the discussions with states to adjust rates for the impact on acuity mix from that roles coming, any progress there, either retroactive or forward given more close to the rate setting season for a handful of states?","David Wichmann","A great question, Sarah. Heather Cianfrocco, CEO of Community & State?","Heather Cianfrocco","Thanks Sarah for the question. So, we've been monitoring eligibility verification as well. And what I would say to you is, it really varies by market. It's so dependent upon this state specific enrollment process. So, it's been a factor in a membership change, sort of in the tail end of \u201818 and for \u201819 from us. But you are right to the extent that it's variable and we see in some states it's leveled off and then we see some that on as they update and become sort of up to date with their enrollment process is that we see that level off or even some of the membership come back in certain markets. So it's a factor for us. I think, to your point, what's important is, one, we work with our states to make sure we understand the enrollment processes that it's smooth for our members and that they're aware of their opportunities and the enrollment process; the two that we forecasted and we considered it in our investments in our membership forecast; and the three that the rate of the -- that the state rates adjust for the acuity, and we're seeing that. So we see that in these states. We have very real time conversations and the states look at the acuity. So, sometimes it may be a timing issue, but we see rates reflective of the acuity of the population based on their reverification.","David Wichmann","Next question, please?","Operator","Next is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Hey. Thanks. Maybe a little bit of a follow-up to that question. I guess, when do you think that the Medicaid business is going to become a growth business -- top-line growth business for you guys again? Obviously, you've exited a few states and the redetermination that you're talking about going on. But, is this something that we can expect to see start growing again as we get to the back half of 2020 or is this a 2021 type dynamic?","David Wichmann","Heather?","Heather Cianfrocco","Sure. Thanks. Yes. Thanks for the question. So, as Dave mentioned in our discussion, in our opening comments, we continue to make progress in Medicaid. And I'm pleased to say we're making a lot of progress in Medicaid. But, as he stated, the pace is not as we would expect, and we're still not where [Technical Difficulty]. That being said, we've had a lot of improvement in our quality, a lot of the markets we talked to you about last year, we've seen better rates in those markets. We're seeing in troubled spots with respect to rate discussions from the previous year, we are seeing improvement there, and we are seeing strong growth in our decent population as well as high quality scores. So, I feel really good about where the -- how the business is improving and the progress made to date. And all the while, we're continuing to bring value to our states with strong performance and innovative solutions to our members and our providers and our team is working hard to make sure we do that for full enterprise behind Medicaid. So, you'll see, as Dave mentioned, continued improvement in that through \u201819 into 2020. And I think you -- and we expect to get near our target margins as we come out of 2020. So, expect to continue to see us improving our performance and we are hard at work at it.","Operator","We'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hi, everybody. If I look at OptumHealth, I guess, the margin is down year-to-year about 110 basis points. I'm assuming all or a significant part of that is the DaVita Medical Group. Can you just confirm that and comment on how -- so away from DaVita Medical Group how the rest of that business is doing, some of the key pockets of the care delivery services you provide, how they are doing?","David Wichmann","Andrew?","Andrew Witty","Yes. Sure. A.J., thanks for the question. Yes. So, DMG is a significant contributor to that adjustment. Really, simply a function of them coming in at lower pre-acquisition margin, business itself is looking good, integration is looking good, and we're very optimistic as why I mentioned earlier on about the speed of which we can bring that organization in and start to improve its financial performance. As you look across the whole of that business and Dave implied this in his earlier commentary, obviously, as we\u2019re shifting more clinics toward risk, that's a significant investment, so that also has an effect as we do that. But, the consequential benefits to patients, reduction in cost of care and then the economics of Optum are very significant, as you go through that journey of capitation and you start to bring those clinics onto full stream.","I'd say across the whole of OptumHealth within a very broad-based positive performance indicators from the vast majority of our businesses, I might just call out one in particular, we haven't mentioned this morning, SCA, the Surgery Center of America [Later changed by the Company to Surgical Care Affiliates]. Just if you look at Q3 over a year prior, our cardiovascular operations were up 13%, our spine procedures up 14%, and total joint procedures up 39% year-on-year. That's an example of one other element of that portfolio in a significant point of growth for us and it fits very nicely within the cluster of other services we offer in key geographies and part of our comprehensive service for patients. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, just drilling in a little bit deeper on Medicare Advantage. This question always seems to come up around this time of year. But with the CMS projecting 10% membership growth in 2020, just curious if your view is consistent with that of CMS for next year or are you still viewing the MA market growth slightly more conservatively in the 7% to 8% range, based on some of your historical comments?","And also with what seems like a notable increase by UNH in your zero dollar premium offerings for 2020, my sense is you probably still are targeting to grow your MA membership a little faster than the market in 2020, which you've done obviously, you said something over the past five years or so. So, I guess, I'm just looking for any confirmatory views around that for 2020, given the overall discussion around 2020 today? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Wyatt?","Wyatt Decker","Yes. Thanks for the question, Steven. As you've heard us say in the past, we suggested the industry growth rate more in that 7% to 9% range. It performed in that range again this year and the last couple of years. I hope they're right. I hope it outperforms that. I think the alignment between where CMS has and us has tightened relative to last year. I think all of the data points suggest continued optimism. And I think that's the key takeaway. And that's my continued sentiment with respect to my comments earlier. Around 2020, obviously, as the annual enrollment period shapes up here, we\u2019ll provide greater guidance. But we've had strong consistent track record of growth and I'm certainly optimistic that will continue into 2020. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about your positioning within your specialty offerings? How much of a focus is on growing that part of your business? And then, you specifically called out behavioral in the press release, but within OptumHealth. So, just hoping you could discuss that specifically and just initiatives more broadly across the specialty space? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Andrew?","Andrew Witty","Are you talking about specialty medications?","Ralph Giacobbe","No. Specialty services in terms of your behavioral health, dental vision, other sort of tacked on services?","Andrew Witty","Okay, all right. So, more on the group benefits upfront. They are critical part of our overall product suite that we offer to the market. It's particularly compelling when you're in the individual and the smaller end of the market to be able to bundle those services together to be able to try their turnkey solution for, let's call it, customers from the individual up to about 500 or so lives. And they\u2019re critical element of the offering that we have as a business. We don't often talk about them, but we do offer dental vision life-based products. And I'd say that those are the most prevalent ones, light in group term relatively small policy limits overall as organization.","As it relates to the behavioral health benefits and the substance use disorder elements of that too, that's part of integrated offering our larger clients look for quite often to provide an integrated medical behavioral benefit, which then also integrates pharmacy alongside all of that to be able to create a seamless experience. Some of our strongest offerings in the markets and our strongest performing plans, particularly for large employer groups are those where we provide an integrated solution set through one of our custom care delivery sites across the United States. So, they are important to our business overall.","Operator","And we'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","George Hill","Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. This is probably one for John Prince. John, we're hearing from the broker community that rebate guarantees from PBMs to plan sponsors are coming in lower than expected with the expectation being drug pricing is going to be lower in 2020. So, I thought -- I was wondering if you could maybe give us some indication of what kind of the water line looks like where there might be risk to OptumRx earnings. And then to the degree to which you can maybe talk about how that benefits the puts and takes in other parts of the business?","David Wichmann","John?","John Prince","Thanks for the question, George. I\u2019d say, maybe just getting above the rebate guarantees, just talk about the market. I'd say the market is really healthy right now in terms of how we're competing in the market. Huge growth in the market in terms of number of opportunities, number of revenue opportunities in the market. So, obviously, it is a market where people are looking for value. And in that value, our value story is resonating very well.","In terms of, specifically, I think, your comment is around drug inflation. And so, our clients are very focused on affordability, both from a client perspective and from a consumer perspective. Drug inflation in 2019 is materially lower than 2018. That trend has been going on for the last several years. As a result, consumers and clients benefit when prices don't increase as much. But however, prices are still increasing higher than core inflation. So overall, we're adjusting our pricing and underwriting to reflect those market trends. And so, I would just say that as the market changes, we continue to adjust our pricing to make sure that we're delivering value for our clients and consumers. So, overall, our clients have been experiencing low single-digit trend for the last several years, which drives value back to their consumers.","Operator","And next will be Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up question on the PBM space. I guess, a slight two parter. First, is the Cigna business in the PBM fully transitioned over now. And then, could you also just provide any color on how the OptumRx business looks for 2020?","David Wichmann","I don't know that we\u2019ll address the second question. We\u2019ll handle that in depth at the investor conference. But, Cigna transition, John?","John Prince","Sure. Thanks for the question. John Prince again. That transition is happening over phases. The first phase happened in the third quarter and the rest of it will happen through the balance of 2020. So, that first phase impacted our revenue and scripts in the quarter as you can see with that. It doesn't have any impact on operating earnings overall. I'd say the transition is going well. We continue to execute for the client. And we'll update our perspective in 2020 at Investor Day.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi. Good morning. I had a question about a couple of public policy changes and just your thoughts on those. The first would just be the health reimbursement accounting rules for 2020. Do you anticipate shift from small group to individual either near-term or long-term and how are you positioned for that given your footprint pullback in the individual market? And the second would just be public charge rule. I know we had an injunction issued last week, but absent that, there is estimates of 200,000 to 4 million people potentially coming off Medicaid, and if you'd want to venture a thought on what that impact might be? Thanks.","David Wichmann","I'm not so sure we're capable of projecting the latter. All I would say is that we're deeply focused on delivering value to our customers and the healthcare system broadly while advancing solutions to reduce healthcare costs and improve quality outcomes and healthcare experiences. And as it relates to rules and evolutions of those rules, we comply with those rules and regulations, and obviously to the extent that they have implications on our business, they will have so. In that case, given the size of what you're talking about in our overall presence, I wouldn't expect it to have a material impact on the Company's overall performance and\/or its expectations around growth. So that's the health reimbursement.","And the other item was -- what was that? I'm sorry that was the charge rule. The other one was the HRA and what the implications are of the HRA on the migration from group-based work to individual. So, I think, first of all, we're supportive of the expansion of the HRA and the ways in which they're used broadly. We think that offering a wider set of affordable options for consumers in America is essential and we much prefer the state-based designs over the higher cost exchange based offerings that are out there today. These will simply provide a greater set of options to people and seemingly a more affordable set overall.","As these things go, they -- I suspect that there may be some migration towards more individual offerings. I wouldn't suggest that that would be prevalent, but to the extent that there are, I think, our Company is well-positioned to be able to offer affordable coverages for people in the commercial individual space. And that's part of the reason why we've spent so much effort over the course of the last 18 months really fortifying our offerings as well as ensuring that the distribution systems are effectively aligned to be able to drive growth and value for the people we serve.","Operator","We'll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John Ransom","Hi. Good morning. More of a bigger picture question. When I look at drug costs being well under control, down maybe under 1%, hospital base flat, just millions of point solutions popping out for every healthcare spend category you can think of. I struggle to connect all those dots to help trend -- cost trends still being 6%, which is as you know 3x CPI. So, in your mind -- and then, you guys doing dozen things in local markets to push risk downstream and that sort of thing. So, what will it take to get the step function trend down say a couple of hundred basis points beyond all the good work that you've already done? I am just struggling why so persistently high. And the Kaiser survey and the political landscape is pointing to this being kind of a bigger and bigger problem, especially with the rise and high co-pay plans. So, is there a horizon where cost shutdown down or are we just stuck at 5%-6% forever more, no matter what we do?","David Wichmann","I think, it's starting shift down, John. And obviously, the narrative that we constructed for today was really all about how we're bringing the strength and power of Optum and UnitedHealthcare to create exactly that shift. And I think we're seeing some decent progress overall, but there is more work to be done. Andrew, do you want to comment on\u2026?","Andrew Witty","Yes. Thanks very much, Dave. And John, thanks for the -- a good question. I'm just going to pick out one detail from the question you asked and then kind of lift up a slightly broader perspective of I think perhaps how Optum can drive the improvement you're looking for. So, you're quite right, and John Prince mentioned today that drug price inflation is decelerating year-on-year. But, what you have to look at is the cost of new drugs being introduced. Drug price inflation is only comparing the price of an existing drug this year versus last year but it\u2019s not addressing the very high cost of new specialty drugs, gene therapies and those sorts of products coming into the market.","So, if you look at the overall average cost of pharmaceutical deployed, I think, the price -- I think, you'll will find the price mix is nowhere near reflected in the decelerating inflation curve. That really speaks to a continued need for focus on managing the appropriate utilization of those types of medicines. They are super exciting for patients, but we need to make sure that we modernize as a system our ability to procure effectively on behalf of our customers and patients. Just one example of why you can get confusing signals when you look at some of this data.","If I just step back from an Optum perspective, what we're excited about and tried to share in the prepared comments at the beginning of the call is we're now beginning to see the coming together of years of preparation and work in various models within the Optum organization. I gave three or four OptumCare examples where we have now seen material reductions in cost compared to previous date. Our goal now is, first of all, to spread that activity across the broader network of Optum, nationally; and secondly, to further deepen the contact, the cost reducing impact by bringing together the various assets that we have in several cities across the U.S. We have tens of different ambulatory assets. We're working to super hard now to bring those together, combine that with the data and analytics that the Company holds. We think that can be truly transformational. So, the challenge is now to bring together these proof points that we have and really deliver an industrial scale across the U.S. We think that's the way to really transform the quality of care for patients and give them reassurance about being able to manage its costs. Thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you. We have time for one last question.","Operator","And that question comes from Whit Mayo with UBS. Please go ahead.","Whit Mayo","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, a lot covered here. Maybe just one outstanding question for me. Just John Muir, I don't really have a sense of the size of that business, not sure what you said or what you can share and is that business additive for you over the first year, maybe just any perspective you can share about the relationship in any potential interest from other health systems to exploring a partnership like that? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Okay. I'll turn to Dan Schumacher.","Dan Schumacher","Good morning, Whit. Thank you for the question. So, in terms of sizing, John Muir, over the contract, which is a 10-year term, is a $1.6 billion revenue opportunity. And obviously our backlog, it contributes a five-year duration to that as well. I'm pleased to share that we're off to a good start and we've transitioned our employees over the course of the third quarter and it's progressing nicely. More broadly, for us, it really marks an exciting transition for OptumInsight, transitioning from what has historically been a point solution technology provider to more of a diversified enterprise solutions organization. So, what does that mean, how do we fully integrate the combination of our data foundations, our analytic capacities, our technology assets, as well as really the knowhow of our 185,000 people, and we're doing that across both the clinical and administrative domains as we move forward. So, in the wake of the announcement, we have seen some increased entrants for sure, and we're advancing those discussions. And we look forward to it contributing to our growth profile in 2020 and well beyond.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Whit. That's all the time we have today for questions. Thank you for those questions. To summarize, UnitedHealth Group ended the third quarter with strong and diversified performance, once again delivering well-balanced growth across our business. We remain confident about our future business opportunities and look forward to sharing more with you at our investor conference on December 3rd in New York. This concludes our call today. Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"21295":["UnitedHealth Group Inc.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical difference or present expectations. A description of some of the risk and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 15, 2019, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company\u2019s Web site.","I would now turn the conference over to Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.","David Wichmann","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. At our Investor Conference just a few weeks ago, we provided an extensive and positive review of our business and expectations for 2019 and beyond. ","Our outlook today remains consistent with that view. We are strongly confident in the fundamentals of our business as we enter 2019, in our ability to invest, innovate and grow and in the breadth of opportunities across healthcare available to a company with the unique capabilities we have built over time to deliver ever more value to society and consistent results for our shareholders. ","The results we reported this morning bear that out. Full year revenues exceeded $226 billion growing 12% or $25 billion over 2017. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share were stronger than our Investor Conference outlook, with full year adjusted earnings per share growing 28% to $12.88 per share. Revenues, operating earnings, and cash flows were in line with or ahead of the expectations for 2018 we discussed with you at that time. ","Optum\u2019s earnings were ahead and UnitedHealthcare\u2019s earnings were in line, and virtually all businesses closed out the year with strong momentum. Overall medical costs remain well controlled and our positive forecast for 2019 remains consistent across all lines of business. ","We continued to address performance pressures in a handful of Medicaid markets in the fourth quarter as we executed actions on both structural costs and rate recovery to ensure 2019 will see a return to stronger margin levels for this business. ","Our nation is early in an exciting healthcare innovation wave, one we expect to help lead, which will drive growth at UnitedHealth Group for years to come. Our approach to this wave has several characteristics. Flowing critical health information to all healthcare participants by linking physical interactions to digital channels supported by embedded proprietary clinical ontology and sophisticated data analytics designed to align and optimize performance; engaging people in their healthcare both individually and at scale, a difficult but essential step in improving people\u2019s health and finances, a step supported by our consumer digital platform, Rally, now with 22 million registered users on a multi payor platform and offering an expanded suite of services for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicaid members as of January 1; applying high-touch human interactions again singly at high volumes to improve the consumer experience and drive better medical care outcomes. ","This is supported by our rapidly growing team of clinicians like the physicians of Polyclinic in Seattle who joined us at the end of 2018; evolving pharmacy care services by advancing market-leading transparency; improved adherence in clinical effectiveness combined with distinguished consumer value ranging from point-of-care discounts that offer more affordable prescriptions and whole person medical pharmacy management to a simpler transaction experience through market-leading digital support tools and services; and introducing innovative, lower cost consumer-centric health benefit designs and services such as Bind, Colorado Doctor\u2019s Plan, Motion, and NexusACO.","This healthcare system will increasingly operate in a multi-payer and value-based context with aligned incentives for care providers and consumers to make better healthcare decisions leveraging deeply personalized information and clinical science. This modern approach produces measurable value and looks and feels refreshingly different than traditional healthcare today. So, I hope you can see why we are energized by the opportunities ahead of us. ","With that, let me turn it to Optum\u2019s CEO, Andrew Witty to discuss Optum\u2019s results and its unique market position and momentum heading into 2019. Andrew? ","Andrew Witty","Thank you, Dave. Our focus is to accelerate the access to and integration of the individual strengths of Optum to deliver better healthcare and more affordability across the whole of the health system. In leveraging our data analytics capability to improve care pathways with local care delivery and pharmacy care services, we have unique potential to improve patient well-being and health while bringing healthcare costs under better control. ","Our ability to use data to better understand the next best action or better option for treatments allows us to significantly affect both the outcome as well as the cost per member for our clients and patients. Within OptumRx, the increasing impact of PreCheck MyScript and the growth of our infusion services illustrate how our expanding breadth of services are gaining significant market acceptance, growing share and diversifying our earnings stream. ","Our momentum in pharmacy care services was excellent in 2018 with retained business rate in excess of 98% and several major new business awards from health plans and employer plan sponsors. We expect this to continue given the early positive signs in this year\u2019s selling season for 2020 business. ","In care delivery, our clinical leaders are applying clinical decision support based on evidence-based guidelines that promote better health and ensure the right care at the right time in the right method. Today, 99% of OptumCare patients in our advanced form of Medicare value arrangements are in four star plans or better, and OptumCare\u2019s average net promoter score is nearly 80, evidence of outstanding clinical outcomes and patient experiences. ","We achieved significantly lower total medical cost by keeping people healthier and avoiding unnecessary hospital use, which translates to up to 30% lower cost for our Medicare Advantage patients relative to original Medicare. Our increased number of our groups are being recognized for achieving lower cost for commercial customers as well. ","For example, our Reliant Medical Group was recognized having the lowest total cost of care by the State of Massachusetts. We complement our medical groups with high value ambulatory care services like our SCA Surgery Centers, MedExpress Neighborhood Care Clinics, Briova Infusion Capability, and Optum HouseCalls, all of which support improving the quality, cost, and experience of healthcare. ","As we move forward, we will continue to build out our comprehensive portfolio of care delivery services in key markets, including through our pending combination with the Davita Medical Group. By 2030, there will be over 80 million people in the U.S. with three or more chronic conditions, up from 30 million in 2015. ","More fully leveraging data analytics across all of Optum through digital and physical engagement with patients and physicians will be key to reducing costs and improving the value and experience for people in this increasingly resource-intensive market segment.","We are building platforms that are convenient for the provider, ensuring the very best and most contemporary information is available to support each patient management decision. Initiatives including the rollout of the individual health record, adoption of emerging genomic knowledge, and full understanding of the implications of the data Optum manages will be key to build \u2013 key building blocks over the next year or two.","Turning to Optum\u2019s financial results. Full year 2018 revenues surpassed $100 billion for the first time. Revenue growth of over $10 billion for the year accelerated to 11% from 9% in 2017, and likewise our operating margins once again strengthened across the Optum portfolio with our overall operating earnings growing more than $1.5 billion or 23% to $8.2 billion reflecting the leverage of Optum\u2019s scale businesses and putting us in a strong baseline earnings position entering 2019. ","Looking ahead, the 150,000 people at Optum are incredibly enthusiastic about 2019 and our opportunity to a longer term growth and performance. We will continuously modernize our ways of working, seek solutions to improve value delivery to our clients and the patients we serve and explore ways of aligning with others who strive in an accountable way to deliver quality care at lower costs. ","We are seeing the fruits of two decades worth of strategic investments with strong business wins and pipelines and the many platform expansion opportunities we have in the United States alone not to mention the global potential. ","As we continue to grow, invest and diversify, we are just beginning to realize the potential that exists when we deploy Optum\u2019s cross-platform capabilities more fully on behalf of our customers, and all of those we serve. ","Now, I will turn the call over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO. ","Steve Nelson","Thank you, Andrew. UnitedHealthcare is growing through the relentless pursuit of better health outcomes, lower total cost of care and a better consumer experience for clients and consumers as measured through NPS. We achieved this triple aim through the breadth and the innovative nature of our capabilities as Dave described at the outset and by translating those capabilities into innovative products, services and enabling technologies which expands our mission as an enterprise. ","In 2018, together with our care provider partners and through digital and physical interactions with consumers, we helped close over 70 million gaps in care, and that was 75% more than the 40 million gaps we closed in 2017. Contracts with value-based care features reached $74 billion in runrate spending with about one quarter of that in risk arrangements. ","Consumers who took healthy actions earned a remarkable $1.5 billion in incentives through their benefit plans. We provided 1.5 million in-home health assessments through the Optum Care \u2013 the Optum Health Calls program and our community health workers referred people to social services nearly 600,000 times linking them to needed services with a total value of one quarter of a billion dollars. ","Collectively, the value of these and other distinctive services helps us to grow. In 2018, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 2.4 million more people with revenues advancing by more than $20 billion to $183.5 billion. UnitedHealthcare earnings from operations were $9.1 billion consistent with the outlook we provided in November. ","Overall, medical cost trends remain well managed, predictable and consistent with expectations. We continue to manage operating cost diligently through a combination of business simplification, automation and operating efficiency. ","As we noted at our Investor Conference, the performance of our Community & State business in 2018 was mixed. We saw strength in serving individuals with the highest health needs such a duly eligible while performance in the traditional TANF Medicaid business was pressured particularly in a handful of states. ","Our performance improved in the back half of 2018 with more work to be done continued advocacy for sound rates, while reducing core medical and operating costs. The Community & State team is fully focused and will deliver improved performance in 2019. ","We completed a strong Medicare advantage enrollment season last month and are on track to achieve 2019 growth with the 400,000 to 450,000 range of expectations. We are thoughtfully advancing in areas like digital therapeutics, real-time health information, and artificial intelligence driving even more distinctive consumer experience, all at lower cost. ","We are early in a wave of fresh product innovation for the commercial market with new on-demand health benefits for large employers and new patient-centric care resources organized around high-quality local health systems such as the program we launched on the Front Range at Colorado. We expect strength in the association health plan market and have an unprecedented focus on developing and cross-selling specialty benefits.","To summarize, our expectations for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s performance in 2019 are unchanged with what we outlined for you at the end of November. As we look at 2019, 2020 and beyond, we are strengthening our capabilities for customers across UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group. We have a multi-billion dollar, multi-year effort, well underway to address medical and operating cost on a structural basis and improved value for customers. ","We are deploying new technologies to provide information to doctors at the point-of-care and are leaning into consumer-centric services like the individual health record and rally and the innovative benefit designs and value-based incentives they can power. And we believe the UnitedHealthcare supported by Optum is uniquely positioned to serve high growth, higher acuity markets like Medicare, duals and patients with complex and chronic conditions. ","Now I will turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. ","John Rex","Thank you, Steve. This morning we reported full year revenues of $226.2 billion with double-digit percentage growth in the fourth quarter revenues for all reporting business segments. For full year 2018, Optum revenues from customer and affiliated with the United Health grew nearly 13%, a faster pace than affiliated revenues. ","This reflects the market\u2019s response as we position Optum and UnitedHealth Group to serve more people independent of payer affiliation even as we offer greater customer and consumer value through United Healthcare. ","Balance in diversification can also be seen in our operating earnings performance where Optum contributed 47% of full year 2018 earnings from operations of $17.3 billion including 60% of their earnings in the fourth quarter. To put that mix in perspective, only five years ago, Optum contributed about a quarter of full year consolidated operating earnings. ","Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings per share of $3.28 brought full year earnings to $12.88 per share, 28% growth over 2017. Full year cash flows were $15.7 billion or 1.3 times net income growing 16% over 2017. Fourth quarter and full year cash flows reflect the $2.6 billion payment to the U.S. Treasury on October 1 for our customers\u2019 portion of the Federal Health Insurance cap. ","Our full year medical care ratio of 81.6% is consistent with the outlook we provided last January of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points and reflects well managed cost strength, despite the margin pressures in parts of our Medicaid business as Steve just discussed. Medical reserves developed favorably in the quarter by $280 million. ","We continue to expect a 2019 medical care ratio of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points, which reflects the impact of the health insurance tax deferral this year. The 2018 operating cost ratio of 15.1% was driven by effective cost management and strong growth and lower operating cost businesses, partially offset by ongoing investments to develop and deploy modern technologies and capabilities that advance the value we deliver to people. ","Turning to our balance sheet, our full year return on equity was strong at 24.4% and our debt-to-total capital ratio was 40% at year end after placing $3 billion of debt in December. We repurchased $4.5 billion of stock last year and we raised our dividend by 20% back in June to an annual rate of $3.60 per share. ","Looking forward, we entered this year with strength, flexibility and momentum and we continue to expect strong growth in adjusted net earnings to a range of $14.40 to $14.70 per share. One last observation on the quarterly earnings progression for 2019. The current first half, second half Street consensus view appears to reflect our seasonal earnings pattern which over time we have described as roughly 48% weighted to the first half. ","In spite of that, our sense is that we expect to perform modestly stronger than the current first quarter consensus estimates would suggest. Dave?","David Wichmann","Thank you, John. 2018 was a strong year with advances in our businesses, improvements in service and net promoter scores and compelling financial performance, but there is much yet to be done to fully realize our potential to re-imagine healthcare for the benefit of society in the U.S. and globally. ","Inside this morning\u2019s business review, we touched on a number of initiatives, all forward leaning, all indicative of a restless ambitious character of this team and our efforts to advance performance in healthcare for those we serve. ","With plans firmly in place we are looking to perform strongly in 2019 and lay the foundation for continued growth in 2020 and the decade ahead. We have significant opportunities to diversify and strengthen the offerings we bring to people, and to drive engagement, trust and loyalty across our broad customer base and we will continue to advance personalized interactions with the people we serve and lean into clinical quality in healthcare delivery and our leadership in digital technology. ","Let me close now and open up the call to your questions. One question per person please. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the color on the medical cost side. I wanted to go back to the Investor Day and ask you about the HIF. It was the first time in probably five years that you didn\u2019t spike out the HIF at all as a moving part either positive or negative. ","I wanted to ask you whether this is indicative of just the size, scale, diversification of the company kind of now being able to hit its 13% to 16% long-term trend without worrying about whether the HIF is coming or going or flat year-over-year as we look out to 2020 and beyond. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Great. Thank you, Justin. As you know, the 13% to 16% growth rate is an average long-term growth rate, and we are in fact committed to it, and I do think there is merit of the scale and size of the company caused us maybe to spend a little bit less time on those reconciliations that maybe what you would have seen in the past. John Rex, would you like to comment? ","John Rex","Yes, thanks, Justin. It\u2019s John. Yes, I have to start by saying I\u2019d be remiss to diminish $2.6 billion of our customers\u2019 funds just having been paid for the health insurance tax. That\u2019s still a very significant number for any company, I would say, and a burden for our customers. ","So \u2013 but, you are correct in thinking that the non-insurance components of our enterprise continues to grow at a reasonable pace, and as that pacing increases and the mix continues to shift, as a percentage of our earnings mix in terms of the volatility that the HIF coming in and out in any particular starts to diminish as a percentage of the earnings mix. But again, remiss to say that it\u2019s still a very significant burden for Americans. ","David Wichmann","And on that score, the health insurance tax is expected to come back in 2020 and I think I\u2019ll recognize this, but it will increase the cost of healthcare by $20 billion for 142 million Americans. That causes the average senior couple to see their premiums raised by $500 per year and for families with small business coverage by about the same amount, around $480 or so per year. ","So, our view is that outcome is unacceptable and - because healthcare already cost too much, so we are going to continue to advocate for our appeal, our deferral of this unnecessary tax. We can\u2019t comment or speculate on the outcome, but we would take this opportunity to also applaud the bipartisan actions that have occurred across Congress both the Senate and the House in this past year or so, and hopefully we will get this taken off the backs of consumers there pretty soon. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Borsch ","Yes, I was hoping that you could talk about the factors that drove the medical care ratio to be a little bit higher than what we and I think The Street analysts had modeled. I mean is that purely the result of Medicaid, and I noticed in the press release that you had talked about that trend moderating, but in terms of impact on MCR, it seemed particularly notable this quarter?","David Wichmann","Yes, well, thank you, Matthew. The MCR impact in the quarter is almost exclusively due to Medicaid performance. We touched on this at the Investor Conference. I recognize it was in response to a question, but throughout the balance \u2013 throughout 2018, we have seen a pullback in our performance in our Medicaid business, in particular, the TANF portion of it and in particular in a handful of states. ","Those issues were as we described in the script, that\u2019s really around both the funding in a handful of states \u2013 some of which you probably recognize were corrected throughout the year, and then also with respect to some of the costs, both medical as well as operating costs in those handful of states. ","The rest of our Medicaid business, both duly eligible and the LTSS populations are performing quite nicely. And of course, as you could tell, our Optum businesses are performing well as well as the remainder part of our United Healthcare businesses, both the employer and the Medicare markets. We did make considerable progress through 2018. ","I\u2019ll tell you the last half of our Medicaid performance is substantially better than the first half, but it just isn\u2019t quite up to par yet as we look into Q4. We have seen, again nice progress throughout the balance of the year, and we expect 2019 to show considerable additional improvement as we move that business back to its target margin range of 3% to 5%. ","Matthew Borsch ","Thank you. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee ","Yes. I don\u2019t recall that you guys discussed it earlier, but if I \u2013 I think you referred to earlier that you guys had won a large VA contract, and maybe if you can kind of give us some details around that, I mean, the headline numbers look very big, but I can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019d be necessarily booking all that. ","Can you give us maybe some color around how we should be thinking about that, I believe it\u2019s in the Optum Health \u2013 would be in Optum Health, may be you could just give us some sense on how to think about that and would that would ramp up, and any color on that would be helpful. Thank you. ","David Wichmann","What you are referring to is the VA Community Care Network contract which was awarded at the end of last year. Andrew Hayek?.","Andrew Hayek","Thanks, Charles and Dave. So, yes, we were pleased with the award of the VA Community Care Network program to OptumServe in the regions in which we did which were three regions. It\u2019s an honor to serve our veterans, and I would really go out my way to recognize the dedicated and talented OptumServe team that is ready to deliver on this contract. ","With the award, Optum can now serve the VA\u2019s capability to provide timely and quality healthcare to more than six million veterans in 36 states to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia and these contracts administer regional networks of high performing licensed healthcare providers who will work together with the VA to provide medical, dental and pharmacy services to veterans who are unable to receive care at their local VA medical center. ","So, we look forward to completing the government review process which of course is underway than normal process and ultimately getting to work serving our military veterans and this is a really important step as you have indicated as an important step forward for OptumServe, which really has the potential to bring the full depth and breadth of Optum capabilities to both current and former members or the armed services in the government. ","Think it\u2019s also another that be remised to not underscored effect that it\u2019s just another example of when there is tension in healthcare, particularly with government that they seek a public private partnership, so in this case, the VA sought a partnership with the private sector so that they could provide better care to the veterans and we are honored and pleased to be able to win these awards and to serve them. ","David Wichmann","Next question. ","Charles Rhyee ","Is that included in the guidance?","David Wichmann","Yes, it is. The contract begins its implementation in 2019, so it actually is a bit of a drag to earnings and it is a seven year contract. So it will provide its returns on that investments through that seven year timeframe. ","Charles Rhyee ","Okay. Thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Sarah James ","Thank you. At the Investor Day, one of the things that you talked about was the potential to double commercial specialty revenue. Can you give us an update on how that\u2019s tracking so far in 2019 and provide some more details on the drivers?","David Wichmann","Sure. Dan Schumacher, please. ","Dan Schumacher","Thanks. Good morning, Sarah. Appreciate the question. Yes, we do and are very focused on deepening our penetration of our specialty blocks within our broader medical, because we think when we bring together, vision, dental, hearing and other assets, you take more of a holistic approach to the person and drive better overall health outcomes. ","We made some nice progress in the 1\/1 selling cycle to drive deeper penetration. But I would tell you that we are in the early innings in the context of doubling it, dental and vision in particular are going to be the foundational parts of that, but we expect nicer contributions from hearing as we move forward as well. ","David Wichmann","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Zach Sopcak ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I appreciate the early selling season comments for the PBM for 2020. Just wanted to get a little more color if there are particular pockets of strength that you are seeing in the 2020 selling season, especially as I think you had mentioned last year you won about three health plan clients on your 2Q call? Thank you. ","David Wichmann","Yes, I think noted softer more excess considerable momentum on the top-line and it\u2019s getting really strong market response, John?","John Rex","Thanks, Zach, this is John. Plenty of more excess overall, our differentiated value story is really about today in the market. We have had good uptake in this past selling season. We are very successful in selling over a dozen new large relationships that had a mixture of both states, health plans, unions and a couple large employers. ","We have also had good retention. Again we\u2019ve had retention of 98% for the third year in a row which we are very pleased about. I think that links back to our strong scores around net promoter score for our clients as well as our consumers. In terms of 2020, we\u2019ve already sold a couple large deals and added some couple large relationships for 1\/1\/2020, we have a very healthy pipeline as we go into the new selling season. ","As you know, for the 2020 selling season, this time of the year is focused more on the health plans and so we are focused on that and then the large employers as well as the state bids for 2020 are just in the middle of their process. So we are optimistic and also we are very pleased that \u2013 that our story of value and stability is really about the end-markets.","David Wichmann","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","David Wichmann","Kevin, you may be on mute.","Kevin Fischbeck ","Sorry, can you hear me now?","David Wichmann","Yes, we can.","Kevin Fischbeck ","Great. So, I just want to go back the MLR question, I guess, specifically on the Medicaid side, wanted to understand two things, one is, is your commentary about the MLR and Medicaid today, the two this is the same as it was back in November or you are highlighting the things that gotten incrementally better or worse from there? ","And then two, just mathematically, Medicaid there is still strength that the activity being talked at variance as to MLR in the quarter just given its relative size, so I don\u2019t know if there is anything else that you would highlight on medical costs?","David Wichmann","And you are talking about variance to Street expectations or?","Kevin Fischbeck ","Yes, exactly.","David Wichmann","Okay. Well, may what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll comment on Medicaid and then maybe just add John Rex to comment on the MLR in case to make sure that we are fulsome in our response to you on that. We are in exactly the same position or pretty close to the same position we were with Medicaid when we discussed this with you in November, in fact what compelled me to bring it out was the commentary, or I believe the question that was asked \u2013 I believe you asked it actually was\u2026","Kevin Fischbeck ","Yes.","David Wichmann","Really around where we may not be performing to our fullest potential and I gave you a few examples this one being on how our business is performing and it is isolated to TANF, it is pretty much isolated to five markets. ","There is pretty compelling what these five markets were as it relates to 2018. The only thing I would suggest is that over the last 45 days to 60 days our teams have continued to make very nice progress and in remediating these issues on plan as we look to 2019 for improved results and we do in fact see nice progress with respect to those. And it is a leading contributor to the MLR view, but, John, do you have anything further to add?","John Rex","Sure, Kevin, this is John. Good morning. So, maybe just to start with the, as you kind of teed up the question that - the fully response here. So, I\u2019d characterize the results, highly consistent with what we laid out at the end of November. So UnitedHealthcare\u2019s full year operating earnings is up $9.1 billion. We are just slightly ahead of the point estimate that we provided at that time and I\u2019d put the kind of 81.6% full year consistent with the approximate 81.5% that we cited at the time also. ","So I would say it as consistent with the outlook that we had as we got to visit with you at the end of November. So in that line. So beyond CNS as we discuss the benefits, the businesses are performing well at least in line with their expectations, medical costs well contained overall and I would suggest that $280 million in favorable developments in the 4Q also as a reasonable indicator of that. ","Kevin Fischbeck ","Great. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Great. Thanks, Kevin. Next question please. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal ","Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate all the color or the answer. Sorry to beat this one. But maybe if I could squeeze my question a follow-up here and maybe could you comment specifically as far as the puts and takes on the commercial side. ","And then Medicare or sort of really on the trend and specifically maybe I would love to know the commercial medical cost trends are to track those into 2018 full year guidance range in the fourth quarter and then if Medicare MCR is sort of right in line with your expectations as we well if anything \u2013 there is anything worth calling out there, could be great.","David Wichmann","Dan Schumacher? If you are in commercial.","Dan Schumacher","Yes, good morning, Steve. With regard to the commercial cost trends, a year ago we have guided to a range which we narrowed at the investor conference in November to 5.5% to 6% and I would tell you that on the year we landed squarely within that. So, very pleased with where our cost came in. From our commercial perspective, as well as then how that translated through to in line with our earnings expectations. ","And I would just point out that, within our commercial block, we obviously have a seasonal bias towards the fourth quarter and that\u2019s the shift that\u2019s really driven by the type of products that the market is buying as well as another pace at which deductibles are increasing year in and year out. And so, that also contributes to how you look at the performance and its progression over the course of the year. ","David Wichmann","And that\u2019s something new. And Medicare had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter and it came in line with expectations, it\u2019s not a little bit ahead.","Steve Tanal ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte ","Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, my question was about the vertical consolidation with the deals closing, Cigna is moving their book to Express\u2019. You are looking forward into the new competitive landscape and talk to \u2013 about OptumRx with the $250 to $300 in savings OptumCare on days per thousand. How are you preparing for care gains while maintaining loss ratios and margins going forward in a possibly bundled commercial and PBM environment?","David Wichmann","We are just running our business Ana and running it very well as John pointed out you are seeing strong performance and growth and I think if you track back the last two years and then leaning into 2019 and now leaning into 2020, we continue to see nice response to OptumRx offerings in part because, it goes well beyond the traditional PBM and operates as a pharmacy care services business. ","The collaboration between it and United Healthcare is long and well established. So it\u2019s not new meaning that the two of them work very collaboratively together on a wide range of opportunities. Of course, that the pharmacy care services business is available on a multi-pair basis as well. But we have a strong competitive offering. ","We work with and deeply respect the new and emerging competition and we are not going to underestimate it but we also remain highly confident in our own capacities to compete and continue to grow and manage our business. ","Ana Gupte ","Thank you. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. ","Scott Fidel","Hi, thanks. Just as you said as the market continues to debate the overall trajectory of the economy exiting 2018 and its 2019. Do you have got a lot of sort of \u2013 few points on that in terms of how the overall economy is progressing in both the UnitedHealthcare and in the Optum businesses. So just interested maybe in some of the more economically sensitive areas what you are seeing in terms of trends in the fourth quarter, particularly related in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter?","David Wichmann","Good questions, Scott. And I have to think in a little bit about this both on the \u2013 we are seeing a lot of economic sentiment if you will, but also political sentiment in healthcare. And I was evaluating that over the course of the last, at least my timeframe here which has been nearing about 21 years or so, just by way of background we have grown our revenue base in this business from $12 billion at that time to $226 billion which we just reported today. ","What I find is, particularly in healthcare, as well economic cycles is that, that sentiment tends to drive our private sector expansion and we\u2019ve seen that through Medicare advantage. We see that with the introduction of Part D, managed Medicaid, Duals, Medicaid expansion changes the ACA broadly and then also what we discussed this morning with respect to the VA and how they have sought public private partnership to respond the needs of veterans. ","One thing that\u2019s true through these political shifts and economic shifts is that healthcare products are always in demand. So whether it\u2019s an economic expansion or a recession or whether there is a liberal or conservative administration, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s positioning tends to be unique and very well regarded. ","We manage a portfolio of diverse healthcare businesses and they serve large and diverse end-markets and we tend to grow regardless of economic cycle or administration. We have unique portfolio of competencies and data technology as well as clinical insights and actually our ability to manage clinical interactions just continues to advance across this business which is reinforcing that capability in our business. ","And our line services have never been positioned to produce greater value for society, for clients, consumers. You can hear us talking a lot more around cite of return in the triple aim and then also becoming more of consumer oriented company which is really what MPS signifies. So, just maybe to wrap up, this is a very scaled improving model. It has a deep management team with strong continuity. It\u2019s largely 95% domestic. ","So we really don\u2019t have tariff, Brexit or other global concerns and it is a long runway for growth. It has five well-defined high performing growth pillars that are going to meet in the $11 trillion global market in 2025. So we like the opportunity that is presented and we believe that whether it\u2019s a political sentiment or economic sentiment, this UnitedHealth Group will continue to provide distinctive results and returns both for society as well as our shareholders. ","Scott Fidel","Okay, thanks. ","David Wichmann","Next question please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","A.J. Rice ","Hi everybody. I was just going to ask, I know at the Investor Day you guys talked quite a bit about the initiative around specialty pharmacy and the acquisitions as well as putting infusion in your prime \u2013 in MedExpress and in some community centers. Can you just sort of update us on where you are at today in rolling all of that out? And sort of a timeframe over how you would \u2013 where you might look into next year or so? And what does that mean for you financially?","David Wichmann","Andrew Witty?","Andrew Witty","Hi, A.J., thanks very much for the question. Make a couple of comments and I am going to ask John Prince to give you a little bit more detail. I\u2019ve been thrilled with the progression of the businesses that you\u2019ve described I think within the pharmacy care services business that John runs as well as within OptumHealth that Andrew runs within these high quality ambulatory care facilities of the type you described really being embraced strongly in the marketplace. ","I would continue to expect to rollout and extend those networks over the next several years. I would just make a further point though. I think it\u2019s really important to think about Optum really as a portfolio of provider networks. So if you think about it, it\u2019s not just about an ambulatory care services like SPA, like the infusion centers, like MedExpress. ","But if those things complemented by such a strong medical provider network in key markets across the U.S. and what you are going to see over the next few years is aiming to bring to life the value of that network, really comprehensive presence that we are now beginning to establish in a series of important markets, we think that can really deliver substantial convenience, quality, lower cost, better service for the patients we serve as well as the plan sponsors that we serve. With that, let me just hand over a bit more specificity to John.","John Prince ","Great, thanks, Andrew and thanks, A.J. for the question. It\u2019s John Prince. In terms of those businesses, especially infusion, we really like that space. We have a very differentiated offering in the market focused on decreasing the total cost of care and also improving the consumer health. We\u2019ve got focus programs clinically that handle our patients through their whole course of treatment. ","We\u2019ve done a great job by transforming the consumer experience as well as the provider experiences on close partnerships between the consumer and the provider as you manage course of treatment. We are continuing to grow extensively in the external market taking business both directly with plan sponsors but also continuing in the open market. ","So, more than a quarter of our business comes from this open market. People selecting our services as their preferred offering because of our MPS and our clinical outcomes. We added \u2013 we are now over 50 sites in terms of those businesses. ","Within the United States we have a significant expansion. We are looking at more of a dozen that are in this coming year and a dozen in the future all in from our portfolio of pharmacy care services. We have over 500 sites as we add in general and other deployments. So, strong performance and strong opportunity. ","David Wichmann","Thank you, A. J. Next question? Sorry. Thank you, A. J. Next question please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Frank Morgan ","Good morning. I think you actually commented about this a little bit at the Investor Day with regard to the loss of the Cigna book of business, I think you commented that it would be a revenue hit but really not a profit hit and just any additional color on why that is and does that also assume any type of operational deleveraging with that lost revenue? Thanks. ","David Wichmann","John Rex?","John Rex","Frank, good morning. It\u2019s John Rex here. So, yes, you are absolutely correct. I did commented at that at the Investor Conference in terms of the potential for that business to transition over the next couple of years and indeed that\u2019s clearly is the expectation here. ","As I commented, that would have a impact on revenue and script counts as that transitions and that really depends on the timing and that timing isn\u2019t completely certain yet in terms of the pacing of that and we are going to work with our customer in terms of meeting their needs on that piece. ","I did also commented it wouldn\u2019t have any impact on our earnings outlook for 2019 and that continues to be the case that it doesn\u2019t have any impact on our earnings outlook. So, that\u2019s to be determined in terms of how it impacts our revenue and script count as we work with our customer Cigna on this. ","David Wichmann","Thank you, Frank. Next question please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. ","Josh Raskin ","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Here with Eric as well. And question on Optum. Rewind about 2.5 years ago, you guys had a couple of really big wins, Summer '16 with CalPERS and Texas employees, GE, et cetera. And I know a lot of that all kicked off on 1\/1\/2017 and multi-year deals on all of those. But you probably got close to two years of data on it at this point and so I am curious what that data is showing in terms of the impact of synchronization. ","There were some targets \u2013 financial targets within those contracts. So, how you are tracking on those? And when do you think you kind of come to market with a little bit more of a definitive study on \u2013 here is what the world look like in these accounts prior to the synchronization and here is what the impact is looking like under the OptumRx contract?","David Wichmann","John Prince?","John Prince","Thanks, Josh. This is John Prince with OptumRx. I\u2019d say \u2013 not again the details on specific customers, I would say overall, we are continuing to execute very well with our \u2013 for our customers. That story around synchronization and which we sold few those customers a couple of years ago was just part of our broader story to the market today. ","So, today when we talk about going to market, we talk about how we are negotiating lower cost of care. We are focused on lowering the total cost of care, improving the health outcomes as well as transforming the consumer experience. That is our core value story. When we talk about the $20 to $25 of value that we deliver for our highest performing clients, that is part of our overall book of business in terms of how we serve our customers. So we actually have a lot of the data. ","That is then leveraging to our story in the market today. So we actually are coming with strong confidence and by our ability to execute and we are in the market now with things around drug trend and how we can actually reduce drug trend. We are actually out there with total cost to care of guarantees in the market and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve done the definitive study. ","We\u2019ve been in a market for five years with the same story and we are executing well and we are on the next generation of it. So we are confident how we are performing. ","David Wichmann","Thank you for the question, Josh. Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Ralph Jacoby ","Thanks. Good morning. We are calculating MLR higher by the 90 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year normalizing for the HIF. If that's all Medicaid, it is a pretty massive uptick for a company your size and we just haven\u2019t seen this magnitude of pressure from others in the space. ","So, I guess, I am just trying to get a sense if it\u2019s unique this puts us like markets you are in than others are and if it\u2019s unique to you in terms of adverse risk within those populations. Just trying to sort of get a sense and reconcile on that and maybe if you can help just with where your pretax margins are within Medicaid at this point and what kind of improvement do you expect in 2019? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Thanks, Ralph. I am \u2013 we are not seeing the same that you are on the MLR calc. So, why don\u2019t we just circle back with you separately on that as it relates to the Medicaid business that is profitable. It\u2019s not at our target margin range of 3% to 5%. ","I would like to see us get into the bottom-end of that range in 2019, will that point be within that range solidly in the 2020 time period and we can say with confidence that that\u2019s the case, based upon the great advocacy actions that we have taken so far, as well as a number of the clinical engagements and operating cost initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place. ","Also want to let you know this business functions very effectively. It has mid-60s NPS scores for the traditional Medicaid population when you get into the duals, it\u2019s into the 70s. It\u2019s often times number one in terms of quality scoring in its local markets. It\u2019s referenceable by all the states. So, I don\u2019t want to overplay Medicaid here. ","We have a short-term issue that take us a little bit of time to work our way out of. Again, we\u2019ve been working on this most of 2018. Became more acute in the first half, really in the second quarter, but we\u2019ve been working hard on it since and you\u2019ve probably seen some of those rate actions flow through. You can probably see that in some of the statutory filings, some of the improvements and some of these states and I think you\u2019ve probably be able to recognize where they are and how isolated it is in our capacity than as a company to be able to turn that around. ","So, we have a lot of confidence in where we are at which is what led by Heather Cianfrocco. She is a fantastic leader and we will \u2013 here team will continue to make good progress on this through 2019. ","Thank you, Ralph. Next question please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Gary Taylor ","Hi, good morning. I guess, MLR will be the theme of the day. I apologize. Maybe could you give us a little help just thinking about seasonality in your MLR and if that's changed? So when we look at third quarter to fourth quarter in 2016, MLR was pretty flat; and in 2017, it was up 50 BPS and this quarter, up 110, but more like 170 if you exclude the prior year development. ","So it does seem like there has been a trend where you've seen more of an increase in the 4Q even as the years come in line. So would you attribute most of that to just some of the seasonality in the commercial business that you've talked to with higher co-pays and deductibles over the years? Or is there something else in the line of business mix that might be contributing to the higher MLRs in the 4Q?","David Wichmann","Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Thanks, Gary. This is Dan Schumacher. So, maybe provide a little bit of context around the commercial seasonality. As you look sort of first quarter to fourth quarter, the change in that medical care ratio generally is somewhere in that 6%, 7%, 8% zone as you move from the first to fourth quarter. ","I would tell you if you look 2017 versus 2018, there is probably been somewhere around a one point shift in that as you look at greater concentration in offering that drive consumption towards the fourth quarter, as well as the increases in the average deductibles. ","And if you look inside of our average deductible increases over the last two years or so has been in the 8%, 9% zone. So, those are the contributing factors that are going to push the consumption and the realization of that towards the fourth quarter and I think that\u2019s what you are seeing inside of it.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Gary. Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Lance Wilkes ","Yes, I wanted to ask a question on the cross-sales and the specialized benefits focus you guys have. And just related to that, you spoke about dental, vision and just kind of additional coverage as being an area of focus. Want to understand how much of a focus was cross-sales or PBM, stop loss and other care management operations as well?","David Wichmann","Okay. Dan, do you want to take that?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Thank you, Lance. Obviously, our ambition is to serve the needs of our clients and we know that when we have the opportunity to really combine the full capabilities of our enterprise taking our knowledge and knowhow with respect to medical offering underpinned by high performing care delivery assets both OptumCare as well as third-party bring in our advocacy and navigation competencies from OptumHealth, our knowhow and intelligence from OptumInsight and then have a chance to take on the ancillary offerings that really contribute to the overall health and well-being of a person that we have our best results and outcomes. ","So, we are no doubt very focused on trying to combine both our medical and our pharmacy, take on stop loss, adding care management advocacy, navigation in support of people along with the ancillary coverage and we are making some nice progress in that regard and we\u2019ve got a lot of upside frankly as you look our penetration rates particularly up market in pharmacy we\u2019ve got a lot of room to be able to serve our clients in a more fulsome way. ","David Wichmann","Thank you, Lance. Next question please?","Operator","Going next to Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. ","Steve Willoughby ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Moving off to MLR for a bit, my question just revolves around some of the new commercial initiatives you\u2019ve talked about such as buying Colorado Doctors and NexusACO, just wondering if you could give us any perspective on the potential membership gains from these programs either in 2019 or 2020?","David Wichmann","Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Thank you, Steve. Maybe just to step back a little bit, from our perspective, we are glad you caught it. We are excited about our efforts to deliver greater value for people and I think as Dave mentioned, we really think that we are on the forefront of a wave of innovation and you named some of those. We see some modest contributions from those efforts in 2019 and increasing efforts in 2020 and beyond. ","Nexus has been around a little longer and more evolved. We had about 75,000 folks in 2018 as we turn into the year, we will increase that nicely and by the end of the year we expect to more than double that. As it relates to Colorado Doctors Plan and Bind as an example, I would say they are on the early end of it. So, again, smaller contributions to our enrollment table in 2019 and growing contributions in 2020. ","But again, like the suite of offerings that we are bringing to market as well as the interest from the clients perspective.","David Wichmann","Great. Thank you, Steve. Next question please?","Operator","Going next to Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Steve Valiquette ","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So, from the January 2019, Medicare advantage membership data that just came out overnight, I know some investors look at these sequential trends versus December, others will look at the year-over-year growth trends. I know it\u2019s early, but we are calculating that at least versus January of 2018 that United grew its total Medicare advantage membership almost 10% and the individual MA membership was up almost 11%. ","So, I guess, the key is that, one could hypothetically suggest that this is trending slightly above the midpoint of the growth, you kind of suggest of 2019 back in November which is obviously positive. So I guess, I am just curious to take your temperature, I just think there is going to be a bias to the upside for your MA membership growth in 2019. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Brian Thompson, address that.","Brian Thompson","Sure, Steve. Hi, Brian Thompson. Thanks for the question. 2019 is off to the start that we had expected, real strong start from our advantage point and I would say what AEP suggests is a performance certainly in line with our full year range. Our share of our growth does suggest some share again, which would be the fifth year for us consecutively with we are certainly very pleased with. ","I think as we talked about in the past, 2019 environment really provided an opportunistic opportunity to really grow meaningfully. I think we took advantage of improving our benefits, but I would also suggest that we were very cautious and very disciplined in that regard, and established our benefit positioning and our capabilities for 2019 with an eye for long-term stability certainly cognizant of the potential return of the health insurance tax in 2019. ","So, really pleased with our positioning and again I think it aligns really nicely with what we had expected. So really a strong start to 2019.","Steve Valiquette ","Okay, great. ","David Wichmann","Okay. Thank you, Steve. Next question please.","Operator","Going next to Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Michael Newshel ","Thanks. John, can you just break down the favorable reserve development intra-year versus anything prior year and I think prior year was lower negative than past quarters. So, is that pattern consistent, and this quarter's development is all underlying 2018 performance?","John Rex ","Sure Michael. John Rex here. Yes, we had $280 million of total favorable development 4Q, that breaks down $170 million current year, $110 million prior year. I'd call the favorable development, it's really indicative of that cost containment efforts across our businesses and across the enterprise. I don\u2019t know how material I put it in the context of $145 billion in medical spend overall and it continues to be our objective to manage that well to improve accuracy. ","We have increasing level of electronic data exchange early detection of hotspots and really more ability to intervene. But we should have increasing accuracy with that and as it relates to kind of our cost containment efforts, some of those they will across in different forms, some of them very near-term, some of them take a little bit longer to achieve. So, sometimes you see a little different mix in terms of prior year and current year. ","Michael Newshel ","Thank you. ","David Wichmann","Thanks Michael. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","David Windley ","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. A question on John Rex\u2019s EPS cadence commentary. I understood, you would say the 48%, as has been in the past but more in the first quarter. So I just wanted to clarify that you are comfortable \u2013 or you are guiding us to the 48% in the first half, but more than in the first quarter. Is that how we are to interpret your comments? Thanks. ","David Wichmann","Dave, thanks for the question. Here is how we view it. So, from year-to-year, individual quarters cannot be impacted by simple factors. I\u2019d call those out as such as that pacing of when weekends or holidays fall. As we all know the yearly calendar is fairly stable. So it\u2019s just typically a matter of differences in quarters and as you would realize those variations are most impactful to the UHC benefits businesses. ","So in 2019, the first quarter has slightly fewer work days than the first quarter 2018. In addition, given the timing of share-based compensation awards and how that impacts our tax rate, we generally also expect the first quarter to have the lowest effective tax rate of the year. ","So, perhaps without getting overly prescriptive and you are right about the kind of 48% mix in terms of how we see the first half playing out and that is still consistent, but without getting overly prescriptive and without knowing all of your models, I\u2019d suggest something roughly in the range of a 1% shift of your full year earnings outlook would be more appropriately recognized in the first quarter.","David Windley ","Thank you. ","David Wichmann","All right. Thank you, David. Are there any other questions?","Operator","It appears we have no further questions. I\u2019ll return the floor to you Mr. Wichmann for final comments. ","David Wichmann","Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate all the questions today. To sum up, the company delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 contributing genuine value to the people. We are privileged to serve and to society at large.

I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here's some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 17, 2014, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we will review our first half 2014 performance within the context of the goals we set for this year and the opportunities we see going forward. We see the next 18 months as important given that by January 2016 the ACA will largely be in place and we will be entering an election cycle that will set the stage for shaping the next phases of health reforms.","For decades, the trend has been for greater private sector engagement in meeting ever increasing national healthcare needs. These include the foundation of what is today Medicare Advantage, the launch of Medicare Part D drug benefits, the formation of accountable care organizations, steady migration of Medicaid to managed care, the expansion of benefit coverage to the uninsured under ACA exchanges and expanded Medicaid programs and the improvements to the healthcare.gov and many state based exchanges.","UnitedHealth Group businesses have participated strongly in each of these developments and we remain focused on making these efforts successful and sustainable as they continue to evolve and settle into the fabric of our national healthcare system. We continue to execute steadily on that change agenda and we believe an improving environment in 2016 and beyond will support acceleration on our earnings growth rate.","This morning, we are raising our 2014 revenue outlook to $130 billion from the previous forecasts of $128 billion to $129 billion. We are strengthening our 2014 earnings projection to a tighter range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share. The increasing earnings momentum we expect in the second half of 2014 should position us to grow both revenues and earnings per share in 2015. Advancing our performance in this 18 month timeframe will remain challenging but achievable, anchored by strong Medicaid growth, steadily strengthening Medicare and international performance, deeper entry into new, more established public exchange markets and continuing strong growth and earnings momentum at Optum.","These elements are visible as well in second quarter results reported today. In the second half of 2014, UnitedHealth Group grew revenues 7% to $32.6 billion and earned $1.42 per share. Optum contributed nearly 30% of our enterprise operating earnings this quarter. Solid cash flows from operations of $1 billion for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the first half of the year were approximately one times net income, in line with our 2013 patterns. As our strongest cash flows come in the back half of the year, we continue to project a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion in cash flows for full year 2014.","Reviewing our results in more detail, starting with UnitedHealthcare. Second quarter revenues grew 6% year-over-year to $30.1 billion. The quarter featured earnings from operations of $1.8 billion, driven by a strong operating margin of 6.1% even with the growing mix of public and senior sector businesses. UnitedHealthcare is seeing significant and accelerating growth in Medicaid. 380,000 more people in the quarter and 635,000 through the first half of the year. Coming from expanded access to Medicaid in about half the states we serve, the launch of Florida's planned Medicaid expansion, and core program growth from already established markets and programs.","In Medicare, we grew to serve more than 400,000 more people across all products in the first half of 2014. A very solid and balanced performance considering the market actions we needed to take last year in response to reduced Medicare program funding from CMS. In the core senior medical products of Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental benefits, we have grown the number of seniors we serve each year for than a decade and this year should be no exception.","There is no question the private sector provides significant value to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare has been and will continue to be a growth business at UnitedHealthcare. We are privileged to serve one out of every five American seniors. Today we serve 3 million people in Medicare Advantage plans and 12 million across all product types. We expect to deliver overall Medicare growth for years to come, driven by favorable demographic trends and our strong local market cost and value positions, supported by deeply integrated Optum resources in pharmacy services, primary care delivery, health calls, data analytics and compliance.","Our Medicare Advantage business works with senior focused care providers under rising levels of well designed shared risk and performance based payment arrangements to deliver more effective clinical management in concert with well-targeted and executed home visits. From the seniors' perspective, we offer market leading access to quality care across a broad spectrum of venues combined with the attractive benefits under strong brands with convenient broad-based distribution.","Commercial membership continued to track with recent trends. Pulling back in risk-based products as we remain focused on pricing discipline and endeavoring to strike the right balance in protecting margin and giving back some past growth. In self-funded products, our momentum is steadily strengthening. We are winning national account business and retaining key customers we are privileged to serve. We are pleased to return to serve as a core benefit option in the State of Georgia in 2015. Customers are still announcing final decisions and our pipeline is much stronger than this time last year. We feel positive about our January 2015 position at this early stage.","In the individual market, we plan to grow next year as we expand our offerings to as many two dozen state exchanges. This approach is consistent with our long stated plan to take a prudent first year position and then build and expand in 2015 and 2016 as these markets become more established. By participating moderately this year and then watching closely and listening, we have learned about pricing, networks, regulatory structures, distribution and the consumers mindset regarding public exchanges. These data points help and form our positioning for 2015 which should be a better risk vintage for the public exchanges.","We believe public exchange markets must be sustainable on their own, so our participation will not overly rely on risk corridors or assumptions under risk sharing provisions. The Congressional budget office estimates that more than 75% of the exchange market is yet to develop. And we believe there will likely be meaningful membership activity in the market after the initial experience of this year and as second year pricing is presented. So we plan to grow steadily from this point forward, advancing our participation in a measured manner in public exchanges in 2015, 2016 and beyond.","Bringing together this year's developments across these various product categories, our original forecast for U.S. consumers served is proving fairly accurate in total with greater incremental losses in full risk commercial benefits which we discussed last quarter, offset by exceptional growth in Medicaid which should come in well in excess of 800,000 people this year.","Turning to Brazil. Amil has seen clear signs of steady recovery from a surge in utilization beginning in the last half of 2013 in response to aggressive, new government mandated access standards. Our premium rates are improving and are catching up to the increased levels of medical services. We are deploying capital to continue building out Amil's franchises in to Rio, Sao Paulo in northeastern Brazilian market, which nicely benefitted our membership numbers this quarter with 110,000 net growth. In our view, Brazil remains the most fertile market for health benefits and services outside the U.S. and we expect our focus and efforts in this large, high potential market will reward our shareholders for years to come.","At UnitedHealthcare, we continue to project a 6% commercial medical cost trend, plus or minus 50 basis points for 2014. Our medical costs remain inline with our plan and remain moderate. The consolidated medical care ratio for the second quarter was 81.6%, 10 basis points higher than last year despite less reserve development and a shift in the mix of our business towards government programs resulting in upward pressure in the ratio year-over-year. These factors were mostly offset by 100 basis point reduction from the implementation of billing of the ACA fees and taxes.","Second quarter results were led by the public and senior sector where revenues from federal and state based programs continued to develop positively. Public and senior sector earnings are running slightly favorable to our original 2014 outlook. We are constructively supporting innovative ways to universally improve the quality and affordability of healthcare for consumers. In one example, we and several other healthcare companies are collaborating with the not-for-profit Healthcare Cost Institute to develop and provide free access to online healthcare transparency tools that offer consumers the most comprehensive and accurate information about the price and quality of healthcare services so individuals can make more informed decisions about their health and healthcare.","HCCI's transparency tool will be available in January 2015 and HCCI plans to advance more free services for consumers and other key healthcare stakeholders in the quarters and years to come.","Last fall we took a more intense focus on improving our Medicare stars performance for Medicare Advantage. We made changes in people, organizational alignment, business processes and funding and resource allocation which we believe are yielding positive results. We project our stars performance for 2015 payment year will be better than expected and will steadily improve in 2016 over 2015 and even more meaningfully in 2017 and '18, creating a steady, multiyear upwards progression. Our commitment is to maintain a baseline of no fewer than 80% of our seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans rated four stars or higher every year.","At Optum, we are tracking to deliver record revenues and profits again this year, driven by market demand for our broad portfolio of capabilities and solutions. Second quarter results are on plan with Optum's margins on course to strengthen again in 2014. We expect margins will reach approximately 7% this year even as our pharmacy services business grows at an accelerated pace. These advances are consistent with our original forecast last fall and Optum's 8% by 2016 commitment. We remain focused on building a scalable, end-to-end services platform. Healthcare system participants are beset with more complex challenges then they have ever faced. Their needs have grown well beyond the standalone product offerings that are characteristic of this fragmented market.","Optum has integrated services and capabilities to better meet and anticipate the emerging needs of the market, whether around advanced analytics and population health, deeply integrating pharmacy and medical management for more effectively delivering and documenting clinical care. These markets each represent multibillion dollar growth opportunities unified for customers in a flexible, modern comprehensive and fully scaled services platform. The growth in revenue, backlog and pipeline and the increasing number of larger, deeper and more sophisticated Optum relationships demonstrates steady progress in converting these opportunities into revenues and provides visibility and near-term growth and an indication of strong long-term future we see for this business.","At the same time, Optum continues to have opportunities to improve its basic operating performance. We continue to better integrate and align internally, focusing on delivering higher value products and services with greater efficiency, better leveraging resources and competencies and information analytics, technology and clinical care, and improving our cost structure and operational efficiency. These efforts are equally important to achieving our long-term earnings goals.","Continued investment remains central to Optum's long-term growth. The quarter carried $80 million in investment costs as we deepened capabilities in areas such as consumer engagement tools and distribution services, next generation analytics that uniquely combine administrative and clinical data at scale, next generation medical care review and compliance analytics and services and international versions of product and services that have become established here in the U.S.","We will be investing startup costs in major Optum360 relationships and Optum technology outsourcing arrangements and moving forward on services focused to the needs of targeted international markets. These investments continue throughout the year but should have less noticeable effects on results in the fourth quarter of 2014 as Optum's overall growth and performance accelerates and we benefit from the impact of the more seasonal businesses.","In the second quarter, Optum's revenues grew 28% to $11.7 billion. Earnings from operations grew 23% year-over-year to $728 million. Operating margins declined slightly to 6.2% due to the planned investments just discussed and the exceptional growth of the OptumRx business. OptumRx again led this quarter's performance. Revenues grew 42%. Earnings from operations doubled while operating margins expanded a full percentage point to 3.6%. We process more than 150 million adjusted scripts this quarter, up 30% year-over-year. Our cost to fill a mail order script decreased 30% over the past year and we expect to drive increased consumer value through higher volumes of mail order business.","We had exceeded our goal of 1 million new consumers served from business awards a spectrum of customers in 2014 and have some early awards in hands for 2015 with good a prospect pipeline. This growth is additive to the natural organic growth led by the in-sourcing of UnitedHealthcare's pharmacy business over the past two years.","OptumInsight's growth was again led by strong performance in government sponsored services. OptumInsight is providing services to five separate state exchanges in addition to its continuing role with the federal exchange. By the midyear point, computer-assisted coding offerings from our Optum360 Revenue Management Organization were installed in more than 50 customers who operate more than 220 facilities. And the pipeline continues to grow.","On the downside, the regulatory pullback in hospital, clinical compliance services continues and has pressures revenues and earnings for that product offering. And at OptumHealth, we are continuing to build out our local care delivery organization. Today our physicians and clinical professionals touch 2 million consumes with high levels of clinical quality to our local clinics, which are prominent leaders in their market. All in, Optum delivered an exceptional second quarter and first half with improved earnings and capital returns compared to a very strong prior year. We expect Optum's earnings to accelerate in the second half of 2014, especially in the fourth quarter as they have in the past years. Driven by strong revenue growth, achieving performance incentives from customers, the accumulating benefits of operational efficiencies and structural cost efforts, and favorable seasonal patterns at OptumInsight and OptumHealth.","Optum remains on page to contribute roughly one-third of UnitedHealth Group's 2014 cash flows from operations, all while investing in future growth of this business. To summarize, the first half of the year was strong with revenues growing by $3.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. First half earnings of $2.52 per share position us positively for the full year growth. With a strong second half growth performance from Optum and seasonal strength in UnitedHealthcare's second half operating margins, expected to help accelerate our earnings and bring us to a strong close.","We see 2014 revenues at about $130 billion and net earnings in the range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share, with cash flows from operations in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion. We are intensely focused on continuing to execute evermore sharply on the details and fundamentals in every aspect of our businesses and in everything we do for the people we serve. We will provide a full view of our 2015 expectations at our annual investors conference in New York City on Tuesday, December 2nd.","So thank you for your time this morning and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of JP Morgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","Questions on medical cost trends. I know you indicated trends inline overall, but given the recent data points out there, I was hoping you might have some color to share in terms of real time Rx trends, hospital discharge planners etcetera. And then just a quick follow up on your Medicare Advantage comments in the prepared remarks. Is it reasonable to expect you are in a position to grow membership here for 2015. Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Yes. So Dan Schumacher, you want to comment. I don\u2019t know if we can get into that level of detail but I think we can add some color.","Daniel Schumacher","Sure. Good morning, Justin. This is Dan. With respect to the costs, obviously in the quarter we were very pleased with our medical cost performance. And as Steve mentioned, our underlying cost trends remain very well controlled. We continue to make improvements in our medical cost management and a lot of that, honestly, is in strong partnership with Optum. Whether it be payment integrity, local care delivery, our partnership with OptumRx and so forth. And so as Steve mentioned, on the full year we still expect our cost trend to be in the 6% plus or minus 50 basis range. We would like to expect that to be closer to the lower end of that range.","With regards to what's happening in the quarter and our early data, nothing would suggest that we are seeing any kind of surge. So as we look at daily hospital census data, as we look at prior authorization for outpatient and inpatient procedures, pharmacy fulfillment, all of those things wouldn\u2019t point to any sort of surge in the quarter.","Stephen Hemsley","Gail, (indiscernible) now if you want to talk about MA.","Gail Boudreaux","Sure. Good morning, Justin. This is Gail Boudreaux. In terms of your question on Medicare Advantage. First of all, we really alike our position around Medicare and feel that the work that we have done over the past year has put us in a good position. So overall we are looking to grow. We will provide you a lot more detail obviously at our investor conference but we do feel that the work around network product positioning value has put us in a good place and I feel positive about Medicare.","Stephen Hemsley","Do you want to add anything?","Unidentified Participant","I think you said it well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I was hoping maybe you could talk about the -- what you are seeing in the pricing environment as an update from last quarter in the traditional commercial risk business and maybe not relative to the 280,000 commercial risk lives that lapsed during the quarter.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure, Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Good morning, Matt. It's Jeff Alter. Really nothing has changed in the pricing environment that we discussed in the first quarter. The pressure remains in mainly New York and a couple of other small group markets. You know I would just remind you that a part of that, or a large part of that 280,000 member loss which related to our individual footprint. We had mentioned in our investor conference that we were going to lose individual business throughout the year because of our pullback in a lot of markets. And I think we are beginning to see changes and some good momentum in other parts of our business, other than those few pressured markets. And as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, really encouraged by the national account season and then our win back of the State of Georgia and couple of other larger public sector accounts.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Has your view changed at all with respect to -- you are looking at 2015 being a quiet year for contract changes?","John Rex","Matt, could you clarify what type, I am not following. It's John Rex.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Well, I think that the question earlier in the year had been, with 2015 are you going to see significant carrier switching, particularly for the large accounts that renew on a calendar year basis. And I think you had said, you thought it was going to be a relatively quiet year for that. Now with your backlog increasing, has that view changed at all?","Gail Boudreaux","This is Gail. In terms of your question, a couple of things. Steve mentioned in the comments and I think Jeff reiterated, in the large case market we feel pretty positive about what we are seeing in that marketplace and the momentum we have. You saw we just won the State of Georgia back, which I think is another positive. In terms of in-year switching, we are very pleased with the pieces that we locked in as part of last year and that provides us a nice long-term run rate. So overall, and we see there are some positive emerging dynamics, but again, we are early into this cycle right now so I don\u2019t want to comment for next year but I think it's pretty consistent with what we have said on the last call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo","Your guidance for commercial loss ratio back in December was 79.2, plus or minus 50 bps. You noted on the first quarter call that the pressure from SOVALDI and the New York pricing market was pressuring the overall consolidated loss ratio towards the higher end of the 80.5, plus or minus 50 bps, but never, I think, specifically noted what the impact was on the commercial loss ratio. So it's hard to tell right now whether the commercial loss ratio is trending about where you expected it to be or is it more worse than you expected it to be. Especially since it looks like there is some gains from favorable revenue adjustments on the government business. Can you talk to sort of the puts and takes relative to the Medicare business -Medicaid business, and the commercial loss ratio relative to your expectations?","Stephen Hemsley","So I will have Dan answer that, but that\u2019s quite a question so we will kind of do it in a summarized form","Daniel Schumacher","Sure. Thanks, Peter. So obviously in the first quarter we talked about both our consolidated loss ratio and the implications underneath that our commercial loss ratio would be near the higher end of the range that we had provided at investor day. And as we look at the second quarter in light of that revised expectation, we see things tracking well. So our commercial business is tracking in line with those expectations coming out of the first quarter and we are doing a little bit better in the government business on the care ratio.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo","And can you specifically say what the revenue impacts were from the favorable true-ups in the revenue development in the government business?","Daniel Schumacher","I am not going to share specifically the revenue developments but just to provide a little bit more color on the revenue developments. They are not something that -- they are not uncommon for us, particularly in the second quarter. And so what you are seeing is a combination of finalization of our 2013 Medicare revenue that has pulled through to our 2014 estimates and we also have true-ups in our state based programs. So we have got true-ups obviously related to the industry fee as we get that, as well as normal retroactive rate adjustments. So all of those things are representatives out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","So just getting back on Medicare Advantage. I appreciate the comments that Gail made around, you guys will look to grow in 2015 and you look your positioning. So is that indicative, I guess it's sort of a two parter so I will admit I am cheating upfront. Are you done with provider renegotiations and network work? And then I guess more importantly, is Medicare Advantage a growth business from an operating earnings perspective next year?","Stephen Hemsley","Steve Nelson, why don\u2019t you respond to that?","Steve Nelson","Sure. First in terms of just overall positioning. Our Medicare Advantage business as Gail mentioned, we really like the performance so far and we have made quite an investment in stars, in our clinical programs and network. And these things have to work together in order for this to continue to be a growth business for us. And so in terms of network specifically, we have done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of shaping our network and concentrating our numbers with high quality and highly engaged providers. That work will continue but I would say in kind of a, more of a different format. We are going to be working more with providers inside our network to further concentrate that membership and expand our ACO footprint, engage more heavily in capitation and other kinds of value based contracting within our existing network, as opposed to actually reducing the number of providers. So it's a little bit of shift towards working with providers already on our network but working closely with our network and shaping it and focusing it in this way as it's going to part of an ongoing process and really important as we continue to improve our stars, our clinical performance and our member satisfaction.","Stephen Hemsley","I think we are very positive on this. We have taken the steps that were necessary and they were the most disruptive and I think at this point forward we are now positioning this business in a way for good long-term sustainable growth, star compliance. And so while we have continued to be working on this, we are very positive about where this base will go.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","So to recap, you are not making -- so all of the heavy lifting and the big changes around providers and things that really impact the member, that\u2019s kind of behind us. The rest of it's going to be kind of behind the scenes, more capitation the better. So I know that\u2019s what gives you comfort on the member side but is it also fair to say that, okay, from that perspective it sounds like you are getting a more efficient network and that earnings growth should be and you sort of reset margins over the last couple of years that it's more conceivable to see earnings contributions from that segment as well?","Stephen Hemsley","So I think you're fine on all those levels. I do think that we have to be attentive to Medicare Advantage funding levels because that has been a pressure point and so forth. But in terms of the things that would be disruptive to the business, Steve, I think those have run the course....","Steve Nelson","Yes, I think you summarized it well. And we think the earnings range for the government business we have talked about for us, between 3% and 5%. And we are in that range this year and we will continue to be in that range. That\u2019s our view and I am obviously not giving specific guidance for next year but more to come. But that\u2019s how we think about it. Really great performance and I am excited about the competitive positioning looking forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities","I was hoping you could provide some color on utilization levels of the newly insured? And it would be really helpful if you could break that out to the newly insured on the Medicaid side, so would work or expansion members versus the commercial side, the exchange members that were previously uninsured?","Stephen Hemsley","We will. And now keep in mind we have a very low profile in exchange, but Gail and team, you want to respond?","Gail Boudreaux","Sure, good morning, Sarah. Steve -- first let me reiterate what Steve said around the public exchange membership. We have got a very modest footprint there so I wouldn't draw any conclusions from our early experience in that sector. On the Medicaid side as you've seen we've gotten tremendous growth. We're really pleased with it. We did expect to see increases in utilization and we also got higher rate sales for that and it's tracking very much in line with the expectations we had. So overall, I think very much in line and we're, again, extremely pleased by the growth that we are seeing not just across the expansion but new states wins as well as expansion of our current existing membership footprint.","Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities","And can you just clarify, I think you guys mentioned you're not relying on three R's for 2015. Does that also mean your guidance assumes no receivables for 2014 for the three R's?","Daniel Schumacher","Sarah, it's Dan. On the three R's, we have nothing on corridors and risk adjustment and we have very modest reinsurance that\u2019s assumed recovery, that's immaterial.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America","One quick clarification before I get in to main question. Did you say Steve that you have expected 2015 stars to be better than expected? I didn\u2019t quite understand that comment.","Stephen Hemsley","Yes. We are expecting to track progress in 2015 and build progress from that in '16, '17, '18. So we are committed and see forward progress in stars.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America","You don\u2019t mean what we know of already. You don\u2019t mean the '14 data for '15, you mean '15 for '16 to be better than expected?","Stephen Hemsley","Gail, you want to respond to it?","Gail Boudreaux","Yes. When the stars were published last year, we had a sense of where our membership was. We have made significant improvements in our group business which will help improve our actual '15 results.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America","Okay. All right. So it's a membership growth within the high star rating plans?","Stephen Hemsley","That\u2019s right.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America","Okay. And then just, so the main question is on the exchanges. You mentioned that your year one was about kind of watching and learning and then year two is more about growth. Can you just give us a sense of some of the things that you have learned? Because you are making a really big move. You are going to do a couple dozen states. You have really moved in. What's given you the comfort and the confidence that this business, since you are still relatively new around the claims development, that it is going to be stable into next year and that this is the year to move in rather than waiting another year to get even more information.","Stephen Hemsley","Well, I will also have the -- so this will be a team response. But, again, this was consistent with how we positioned this right from the beginning that we would observe the first year for the most part and then endeavor to participate. And we will see how we ultimately participate as we go through the balance of this year and get ready for the next year selling season. But the size of the and response of the exchange, we expected growth in it and so forth plays into that thinking and recognition this is going to be an established sector in the healthcare benefits marketplace and that we have to chose to participate at some point of time. It kind of wanted to make sure that we don\u2019t go in too late. So I think, we are thinking this is about the right time.","Gail Boudreaux","This is Gail Boudreaux again. The only thing I would add is, getting back to Steve's comments, we have felt it was a good long-term market. What we have been able to observe and learn over the course of the market as we know the existing pricing, we know the network constructs, we know the consumer behavior on what they picked in these different markets. We have a better understanding of the regulatory structure and the distribution cadence. So from those factors, we are looking at the market as an opportunity. And again more than 75% of that market is going to emerge, we feel that those markets that we are looking at now are much established. So that\u2019s the background around our thinking on exchanges but again we have always thought it was part of our strategy and plan, that this is a good long term market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Moving over to the operating costs, they were actually meaningfully below our expectations and down year-over-year I think once you accounted for the charitable donation despite the pressures from the industry fee. Could you perhaps discuss the level of investments in the quarter and what other savings may have drove down that ratio?","Dave Wichmann","Sure. We are quite pleased, Andy, with the operating cost ratio for the quarter. Obviously it's got a lot of pressure because of the implementation of the insurers fee in the second quarter which of course, it wasn\u2019t in place last year. We are really seeing the advances in our contributions from our PBM business, which is benefitting not only from scale efficiencies but also significant productivity advances, both around just regular process management as well as the implementation of technology. So Dirk and team have done an excellent job there. Otherwise, as we indicated in the investor conference, we were pursuing somewhere around 70 to 80 basis points of annual productivity improvements and we in fact achieved those in this quarter. So really what you are seeing is just raw productivity and scale advantages coming through our businesses as we project it.","In terms of investments, I think we outlined those in the script with respect to the types of things that Optum is investing in. It's really investing in growth and I think that growth is really manifesting in terms of its pipeline expansion year-over-year. Kind of very nice job there and as indicated those investments were about $80 million in the quarter. On top of that as you might suspect, there are significant investments going in across the business so to respond to the implementation of the ACA provisions as well as growth -- more broadly -- are preparing for growth more broadly both in the exchange marketplace as well as in Medicaid.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna","Just wanted to come back to hepatitis C. Obviously it hasn\u2019t been talked about nearly as much on this call but can you give us a sense for how the expenditures sort of tracked from Q1 to Q2 and sort of the pace of expenditures you are expecting in the back half of the year given the potential for some new drugs coming to the market. Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. Dan?","Daniel Schumacher","Sure. Good morning, Chris. Our Q2 spend for hepatitis C was in line with our revised expectations coming out of the first quarter. We will tell you that in the first quarter, our new patient volume peaked in all of our benefits businesses and I think we have got strong controls over the appropriate use. So as we think about the cost related to hepatitis C and its treatment, we have that accounted for and accommodated within our full year trend outlook as well as in our care ratio guidance.","Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay. And then if I could, how are discussions going with the state Medicaid partners with regard to the drug. Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Austin?","Austin Pittman","Sure. This is Austin Pittman. First of all, again, this is the cost of the program we expected to be fully reimbursed. We are very pleased and making strong progress in our discussions with our state partners in securing that reimbursement.","Operator","Our next question comes from A. J. Rice of UBS.","A. J. Rice \u2013 UBS","Maybe a two part thing on Optum. First of all, I know you have talked around the investment spending and said it was $80 million in the second quarter but that by the fourth quarter it should have less impact. Is that because that $80 million run rate goes down or is that because of the leverage of spending. And then more broadly, just on OptumRx. You mentioned some positive related to the 2015 selling season. I wondered if you can expand more on, is Optum out there actively pursuing business across the board. Do you have your integrated model fully in place now or you can talk to people about total cost, or is that still something that will come in future selling seasons.","Stephen Hemsley","We will be anxious to answer that question. Larry, you want to take it?","Larry Renfro","A.J., it's Larry Renfro. I will start with the question on the planned investments and then I start to take up the PBM question in terms of the sales. So when we began the year and had our plan put together, we expected to spend about $200 million in what I will call planned investments for the future. It's a very very similar model to what we have actually done with the PBM and I think you know over the past few years we spent some dollars in order to get the platforms up to speed and we are kind of using that same playbook. So for the year it's $200 million. We have spent year-to-date about $140. So obviously we are overweight in the first half of the year and we will start to see that go down as we head into the fourth quarter.","So financial targets and so forth, this is all planned. There is nothing out of the ordinary. So we are online or inline with everything that we are doing. So again, let me say that again, it's $140 million year-to-date that was planned year-to-date out of a total of $200 million. Dirk?","Dirk McMahon","Yes. So A.J., thanks. A couple of things first. Steve mentioned that we had a nice year in 2014 with respect to our growth. As we look at our pipeline for 2015, our pipeline is up double-digits compared to the same time last year. It's not a ton of business changing hands. If you look at what we have closed this year versus the same time last year, we are certainly ahead. We do feel that our synchronization message is resonating in the market as we go in and we talk to our prospects. It's all about bringing together the medical, the lab, the pharmacy data. Try to optimize outcomes and lower cost. We think we also have a good service offering and I think we do a pretty good job managing specialties. So all of those are contributing to our success.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just wondering given the broader entry into the public exchanges in 2015, what your strategy is for surmounting the auto enrollment policy that would seem to give an advantage to incumbents? Is it more that you just expect so much more growth in the exchange market that that's not really an issue? And just wondering whether you think that that policy is a bit anti-competitive for new market entrants or that it just benefits the market in terms of reducing likely the overall amount of churn in the market?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure, Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Good morning, Scott, it's Jeff Alter. On the first part, there is going to be, as Gail and Steve mentioned earlier, still a large amount of the population that we expect to be in those exchanges, we will call at the end of the cycle and we expect to take a large part of that new business. But just on the existing population. You know there is a lot of leverage around the subsidy and price changes, so as competitors change prices, it does tend to move the subsidy dollars around pretty strongly. So we believe there will some, there will also be shopping even though people don\u2019t have to shop. I think just the natural consumer play at an exchange is going to cause a shopping experience and we feel we could get some part of that membership shift as it goes along. We are obviously not going to comment on the anti-competitive part of anything.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And just as you see some of the initial rate filings now coming out for the exchanges in the individual market when, how would you say that those are coming out so far relative to your expectations in terms of the competitor filings.","Stephen Hemsley","I think they are within our range of expectations. You are seeing competitors you might have relied a little bit on the three R protection and as that protection goes away, they have to adjust their pricing. And we are seeing that. So nothing that we have seen to date surprises us or changes the approach that we have taken with our own pricing. We are very comfortable with our pricing and just keep in mind that that pricing is driven not only by our forward view of cost but also, as we have mentioned, we have observed the marketplace. In 2014, we are bringing different products to market in some of these exchanges than we would have traditionally brought. Some more HMO. Much tighter alignment with Optum and some of their programs to help us manage the diseases the health of those members and creating a different -- in some cases a different dynamic with the network.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company","Could you paint us a picture around Optum360? What kind of investments are you making specifically there this year versus next year? What's the potential? What does this look like a couple of years from now? I am having a hard time visualizing the benefit of the financials and precisely what the model looks like?","Stephen Hemsley","Yes, Larry, you want to start?","Larry Renfro","Sure. Christine, I am going to hand this off to Bill Miller who is the executive that runs the OptumInsight and where Optum360 sits. And we will not specifically talk about our customers. Maybe I can frame some of the size of our potential accounts and where we are headed and I will let Bill then to talk specifically about Optum360. I think you know that when we set priorities for 2014, we talked about, really one of the priorities going after, and Steve mentioned it earlier, for the larger, deeper relationships and more complex relationships. And last year we aligned with an organization on the west coast to build revenue cycle management and we are starting to build that.","So I am going to give you four, four areas that I would say that will kind of depict what we are trying to do and the size of that. Our external backlog right now is up 20% and that\u2019s up to $7.5 billion. Our pipeline is up 122% and continuing to grow. I will say that the government business is in that and if you look to that as a standalone, that's about $1 billion. Probably about $6.6 billion in that total pipeline. If you looked at our top 25 accounts and the revenues that we have had over the past since 2011, our revenues are up 2.5 times. And our accounts that had values of over $100 million are also up 20% year-over-year in the number of accounts that we have.","Obviously Optum360, we have a strategy that we are not going to get into detail about because it is an extremely competitive strategy that we are deploying. That's why the amount of investment that we are actually putting in in the first quarter and we will start to see in the fourth quarter, I should say the first half of the year. And we will start to see the benefits of that in the fourth quarter as we talked a few minutes ago with A.J. Also be able to note that we are overweighed in our spend during the first six months of the year. So let me let Bill talk specifically about Optum360 and some of the things going on there.","Bill Miller","Yes, Christine, good question and thank you. So as far as painting that picture, I think the picture is, that\u2019s a very big market, a fragmented market. And we see ourselves I think very well positioned to drive a lot of efficiencies for health systems that are struggling with that fragmentation. We also bring I think a very strong attitude not only from a technology standpoint which we have served the market with for years, but all the services and processes needed to take out cost and operate a revenue cycle with far more efficiency that\u2019s going to be required in an environment where hospitals are continually pressured on their margins.","And I think the other thing that we keep top of mind in terms of that vision of the future is we feel uniquely positioned to help drive out the friction between payers and providers, and we also do understand that in the future the role of the consumer and the patient experience associated with their care, their billing is something that\u2019s very critical and I think it's part of the mission of Optum360. And the investments associated with that are, I think being able to strengthen our technology portfolio along with on-boarding our largest clients and as Larry said, these relationships are growing in size and we really like the trajectory and the backlog that we have built and the pipeline growth that we have seen. Particularly over the last, I would say seven, eight months. John, you want...?","John Rex","No, I think -- just to add, Christine, you talked about -- less obviously you talked about the scope of those investments that\u2019s clearly encompassed in the $200 million that Larry has been talking about for full year.","Stephen Hemsley","And a lot of it is basically implementation on a much more comprehensive revenue cycle, population health, analytics paradigm to change the dynamics in large systems.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","I want to go back to the MLR point. Can you maybe talk about seasonality in the business, sort of your thoughts there with sort of the continuation of and high penetration of high-deductible plans? Whether there is a potential that that sort of magnifies the cost picture, I guess in the second half of the year. And then along those lines, MLR guidance I guess is still close to that 81% level. You did 82% in the first half. Obviously it implies 80% in the second half. Is that kind of still a fair way to think about it? Thanks.","Daniel Schumacher","Hi, Ralph. This is Dan Schumacher. On the seasonality related to high deductible, we continue to make inroads in high deductible offerings. I mean it\u2019s an offering within our portfolio. I wouldn\u2019t say that there is any dramatic shift. I think the normal seasonal progression is what you should expect with regard to commercial and how deductibles play out. With regard to the consolidated loss ratio, our full year guidance was 80.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points and we suggest that that could be near the high-end of the range. And I think that\u2019s exactly how you should think about it.","Stephen Hemsley","So no change there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann","I wanted to get some color on the [uplift] (ph) for the small group market in 2015. Now that there is proof of concept for public exchanges, might your competitors and you be more incented to price down because you would still make a margin higher than your potentially public exchange start to trip there offerings of benefits to their workers?","Stephen Hemsley","I am not sure that we got clear on the last part of your question. You want to refine that Ana?","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann","Yes. So I guess what I am trying to understand is, I am hearing generally the buzz is that small group employers are more likely to dump or reduce their offerings for '15. So would that potentially put more pressure on the pricing as well as the size of the market for '15?","Stephen Hemsley","Okay. Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Good morning, Ana. It's Jeff Alter. We continue to believe that the employer dumping will be somewhat moderated, it was moderate this year. We are not sure next year is any year that would be much different than this year as these exchanges establish. And I would say, as you are seeing some of the pricing normalize which might take another year or so for that to happen. Just on the pricing interplay between the two markets. They are different markets and we look at them around the population that we are serving in each one of those. When we think about pricing there is no, right now in our thinking there is an arbitrage between those two marketplaces. They are different. There are different consumers served in those marketplaces. And our pricing for small groups is solely predicated on what we believe that risk looks like, what that membership looks like and then our responses to that risk. And that would be the same for the exchanges as well.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann","And does it include your self-insured competition as well. Is that propensity continuing to self-insured? Continuing as there is (indiscernible)?","Stephen Hemsley","Ana, I don\u2019t know what kind of phone you are on but it's not coming through clearly at all. So you want to try that one more time?","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann","I was just asking if that is also consistent on the self-insured small and mid-market competition. Is there more movement to self-insured that could create pricing pressure again in fully-insured?","Stephen Hemsley","I don\u2019t think any difference in what has been going on steadily for maybe the last decade but, Jeff, Gail, any response?","Gail Boudreaux","This is Gail. No, we haven't seen any acceleration. There is no, as Steve said, a historical trend to self-insured. There was some early discussion around that moving down market but we haven't seen an acceleration in that?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Carroll of Stifel.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus","So question on your Medicaid performance. You are showing very strong results. So I wonder if you could remind us just kind of what you expect into next year. I mean do you expect outsized enrollment growth to continue into 2015 and additionally, where do you expect pretax margins in this business to settle out given a larger population driven by the Affordable Care Act, as well as new groups like dual eligibles?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. Austin?","Austin Pittman","Sure. Thanks for the question. We are excited about the growth as well. It's been an outstanding year as Steve highlighted in his opening comments. We now expect that growth to be over 800,000 on the year. And I will tell you that the thing that is great about it, is if you look at this quarter's growth, the 380,000 that we grew this year, it's really evenly split between expansion populations as well as what I call core growth. So that\u2019s winning procurement, executing those procurements, implementing new programs within states that we are already in that state and have a relationship, and good strong organic growth. I think as far as the prospects for continued growth, we feel very strong about this business. Particularly if you look at the combined strength of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, our ability to really address state partners needs to deliver value in complex population. So I think the outlook is strong.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus","And margins?","Austin Pittman","As we have talked about before, we expect this business to continue to perform at 3% to 5% range.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And that the scale will pull you to the stronger side of that?","Austin Pittman","Absolutely.","Stephen Hemsley","But that\u2019s do different than where he have been for the last couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies.","Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies","Wanted to get a little more framing around your SG&A expectations as the year progresses. There has been a fair amount of conversation about investments. Your first half is well below, I think your full year guidance. I guess I am trying at, could we expect that the full year will trend towards the lower end of that based on where you are looking so far this year or are there discreet investments that are layering on there in a fairly significant way to drive that up. Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Yes. I guess a couple of things come to mind, is that we are clearly focused on continuing to be focused an efficient in this. And then there is the selling season in the second half of the year, is a big factor. But, Dave?","Dave Wichmann","Yeah, David it's Dave Wichmann again. As Steve outlined, it's both the selling season in the back half of the year which effects Q3. Kind of the preparatory work in advance of OEP and then in the Q4 the actual payment of commissions and otherwise associated with that business. But also the significant work we do to prepare for January 1st and the incremental volumes form growth in our business. So we always see the back half of any given year as having a higher operating cost ratio then the first half of the year. With respect to where we are at on overall guidance, we said it would be 16.7% plus or minus 30. We are still squarely within that range for the full year.","Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies","Are there, perhaps around exchange, your significant increase in participation in exchange that you anticipate for '15? Is that in line with what you would have anticipated when you gave guidance originally or is there perhaps more investment to prepare for that for 2015?","Stephen Hemsley","David, it's in line with what we had planned all along. So we always anticipated a more modest participation this year and then ramping in the 2015-2016 time period and that\u2019s exactly how this is playing out.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Wright of Sterne, Agee.","Brian Wright - Sterne, Agee","Could you tell us how much of the sequential revenue growth at Optum this quarter was internal versus -- OptumRx was internal versus external?","Stephen Hemsley","I don\u2019t know if we can but obviously just given the size of UnitedHealthcare that it's a meaningful and the in-sourcing. It's a meaningful element there. Dirk, maybe you could comment generally on your balance for the year. I think you may have that available.","Dirk McMahon","Well, I guess what I would say is, we continue to have a pretty good year as we sit and look at it. Some of the efficiencies that Dave pointed out, we will continue to leverage those as well additional purchasing efficiencies that we have specifically in the generic area should continue to make us expand margins a little bit as we proceed through the year.","Brian Wright - Sterne, Agee","Yes, if I could follow up on EPS progression. Does the commentary about the acceleration in Optum in the fourth quarter and then getting the Medicare Advantage true-ups in second quarter versus third quarter, does that change the back half seasonality versus more recent years like last year?","Stephen Hemsley","No, I think in general the pattern is consistent year to year. So the relative, kind of 40:60 in terms of the first half through the second half and then the fourth quarter should be stronger than the third. So that pattern holds up.","Operator","The next question comes from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl McDonald - Citigroup","Six months ago you talked about growing earnings in 2015 but not at the long-term target rate. The earnings growth you talked about this morning, is that still the right context to think about? And related to that if there's any major shift in the moving pieces that you've highlighted previously in terms of another year of reforming from the patient Medicare rate cuts, that would also be interesting.","Stephen Hemsley","Yes, I am not sure I got the second half of that but, no, we would expect that our targeted growth rate which is kind of 13%-16%, that 15% would be in that zone, just given the continued adjustments. But then moving 16%-17% beyond, we clearly are focused on getting back to that zone and see a path to that. But the timing in terms of stepping through '15-'16, that\u2019s what we are navigating right now.","Carl McDonald - Citigroup","I'm sorry, the second half of the question was just if there was any change to some of the bigger moving pieces you talked about previously for 2015 in terms of Medicare rate cuts as well as another year of reform implementation being the biggest headwinds to getting to that long-term growth rate?","Stephen Hemsley","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say there are new headwinds, which is a very positive thing to be. And I actually think that we are making real progress on the -- I think this quarter's performance and kind of our outlook. We are making steady progress on the challenges that are in the marketplace for us and everyone else. So I don\u2019t think there are any dynamic elements of that. If I go back to the things that I have parsed through in thinking about that, I would say the Medicaid performance and growth is a nice upside. I think our positioning on Medicare, I see us having made a nice adjustment here and are focused on making sure that we are attuned to kind of the next era of Medicare Advantage and Medicare product progression. We see a nice potential in terms of the international market place and good work that has been done in Amil.","We are going to keep a positive posture towards the exchange market place and see that in the kind of same margin range as our, let's say our Medicaid business, at a 3% to 5% range. When you look at Optum and its potential and the opportunity for the collaborative care, local care delivery businesses, the potential of the major relationships. Kind of anchoring relationships for OptumInsight and 360 and the ability to kind of diversify and take a new, maybe broader more progressive approach on the PBM. That really does start to tie in medical costs, diagnostic testing and specialty pharma and so forth. I think that to provides a lot of potential to work with, kind of against the challenges that the ACA set in front of all of us and that we are working through right now. So that what gives us a view that we have a lot of work to do but there is lot to work with.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Stephen Hemsley","So with that we appreciate very much your attention today at UnitedHealth Group. Optum, and UnitedHealthcare delivered, I think a very solid second quarter. Growing both revenues and earnings per share. We remain focused on consistent, fundamental execution, innovation, service. We believe we are positively positioned for the full year and a strong close in '14 as well as continuing growth in '15 and beyond. So thank you and we will see you next quarter?","Operator","This does conclude today's UnitedHealth Group's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

Information represented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 18, 2019, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.","I'll now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann. Please go ahead. ","David Wichmann","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong well balanced revenue and earnings growth across our businesses, continuing trends of the last several years. We have considerable momentum, improving the consumer position and customer experience, applying rigorous net promoter disciplines within a culture built to serve people's most fundamental need their health. ","Executing on our mission, helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone, produces value for people, the health system and society, overall, and strong returns for our shareholders. ","In the first half of 2019 total revenues grew year-over-year by 9%, or $9.6 billion to $121 billion. Adjusted earnings per share advanced 18%. Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum contributed strongly to these results, generating total enterprise operating cash flows of $9.1 billion or 1.3 times net earnings. ","Confidence in our ability to continue to advance our fundamental performance and profitable growth leads us to increase our outlook for full year adjusted earnings to a new range of $17.40 -- $14.70 to $14.90 per share. We are constantly developing and refining our differentiated set of core capabilities, enriching, integrating and applying deep proprietary information sets to improve engagement and clinical decision making, embedding modern analytics and technologies across the system to make it more interoperable, transparent and efficient. And expanding the scope and effectiveness of our clinical capacities, and aligning with others to value based incentives to improve health outcomes while lowering costs.","As we work in partnership with the care community and others, these competencies enable us to develop the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. A system that provides high quality, efficient and fair access for all. You can see the latest evidence of our progress on a number of fronts, our recently completed combination with DaVita Medical Group meaningfully expands Optum Care\u2019s nationwide network of physicians. ","The John Muir Health strategic relationship announced yesterday is unique and expressive services and demonstrates the roll Optum can play when it\u2019s fully aligned with its customers, serving the needs of local communities.","Continued OptumRx gains in employer health plan and coalition markets reflect the distinctive more wide ranging and more modern consumer approaches OptumRx applies to deliver value addressing one of the most challenging burdens of healthcare, excessive drugs and biologic costs. The first 20 million real time interoperable individual health records are being scheduled for market deployment. We remain optimistic about the potential of these deeply personalized health records, and associated next best action recommendations to improve the health of people we serve and the overall system performance.","Consumer engagement aligned to this actionable health information plays a critical role in developing the next generation health system. By the end of this year, Raleigh\u2019s [ph] digital engagement capacities will be available to nearly 20% of the U.S. population, solidifying its opportunity to advance individual health at scale.","Physician data sharing and value-based incentives round out a true end-to-end alignment of a progressive health system. Value Based payments to care providers are growing at more than 15% in 2019, aligning incentives to practice high quality care, while improving the effective use of health system resources. We expect these value-based payments to ramp at an even more accelerated pace in the coming years.","All of these and the examples offered by our business leaders today are only a partial reflection of the steady progress we are making in advancing our enterprise mission to make healthcare work for everyone, so everyone can live healthier lives. The results are compelling. We are lowering costs trends, steadily improving NPS, and achieving improved clinical outcomes, leading to continued long-term sustainable performance and growth for our business.","With that, I'll now turn to UnitedHealthcare's new Chief Executive Officer, Dirk McMahon. Most of you know Dirk from when he was first joined UnitedHealthcare in 2003. Having worked in major leadership roles at UnitedHealthcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group he notes firsthand how to maximize the full capabilities of this enterprise, including the clinical capacities of Optum Health, the data insights and advanced technologies of OptumInsight and the distinguished pharmacy care solutions offered by OptumRx. Dirk?","Dirk McMahon","Thank you, Dave. Glad to be back at UnitedHealthcare. I'm pleased with what I've seen in the first few weeks in the role, we don't need a major shift in direction, but we will sharpen our focus on delivering consistent growth performance across all market segments. An essential step to drive growth is consistently achieving superior operating and middle co-cost structures. Cost impacts member health when it is a barrier to getting care, and we need to address that even better for people. It\u2019s the primary driver of consumer satisfaction in NPS. When we improve satisfaction in NPS we drive growth.","We\u2019ll continue our intense focus on simplifying and improving the experience for people. Using our digital platforms and applications, we can improve our ability to help people navigate the complexities of healthcare and get people on effective care pathways. This creates a better clinical and service experience, which leads to better outcomes, cost containment and satisfied members.","Some of the essential elements of this include, better information sharing with consumers and their doctors, creating aligned incentives among consumers, care providers in Unitedhealthcare, tailoring products to consumer needs, providing digital and human navigators to support consumers in their health and care journeys and offering practical technology at key decision points.","Simplicity is vital to making healthcare easier, our Navigate4Me offering simplifies and personalizes care for seniors with complex conditions. It provides them with a single point of contact for concierge services, and a dedicated team of experts, supported by a proprietary technology platform with integrated data, navigators help coordinate care through personalized care plans and address social determinacy.","Results have been positive, with a 14% reduction in hospitalizations, and a 9% reduction in ER visits for patients with congestive heart failure. Navigate4Me dramatically improves NPS, now nearly 20 points higher than traditional approaches. With nearly 1000 Navigators now in place, we will continue to expand appointment and impact over the coming quarters. ","We have created simplified paths, enabling doctors to provide high quality surgical procedures and ambulatory settings. These can be less than half the cost of traditional inpatient settings, with higher quality outcomes and greater consumer satisfaction. And, our recently launched preferred lab networks create paths for patients and -- physicians and patients to use to lower costs testing facilities, make it easier to order labs electronically, and provide turnaround times to results. ","From these examples and more across inpatient and outpatient services, we see an opportunity for more than 20 billion in potential annual savings in spend, managed by United Healthcare\u2019s employer and individual business alone and reducing unwanted variations in care, converting care to the most appropriate side of service and aligning with high performing delivery systems.","We continue to diversify and extend our employer and individual business, organizing local systems of care physically, virtually and digitally, building collaborative relationships with care providers and sharing data by directionally with them and innovating around product designs. ","For example, our partnership with Centura Health announced last year in the Colorado Doctors plan is achieving price points 20% lower than our broad access offerings. Some of the attributes driving this success include the use of effective referral patterns, timely texting with alternative care options when a patient registers at the emergency room and virtual appointment. This is the type of total cost of care product innovation you should expect from us.","Likewise at community and state, medical costs and operational improvements are advancing nicely as planned. And on the growth front, we're preparing to serve more people later this year with our recently awarded North Carolina opportunity.","Our businesses serving people who are duly eligible for Medicaid and Medicare continue to expand and perform well. The outlook for further growth in this category, and more broadly in the group and individual Medicare Advantage remains exceptional. Year-over-year, we've grown by more than 540,000 people across these important areas greater than 10%. We see significant macro revenue growth opportunities in these categories for years to come.","As such, we will continue to invest in many ways ranging from stable benefits to better coordination of care. For example, in 2020, we will provide all duly eligible members with a personal care coordinator to help manage their Medicaid and Medicare benefits and coordinate clinical needs, such as appointment scheduling, filling prescriptions and closing gaps in care.","UnitedHealthcare\u2019s financial performance continues to be strong. Revenues grew 6% to $48.6 billion, while operating earnings advanced 12% to $2.6 billion in the quarter. I'm looking forward to working with our team to further elevate UnitedHealthcare\u2019s performance from the strong position we hold today, delivering more value across multiple dimensions in healthcare.","Now, let me turn it over to Andrew Witty, Chief Executive Officer of Optum.","Andrew Witty","Thank you, Dirk. At Optum, we\u2019re developing and building a broad set of capabilities, supporting a vision for providing better healthcare and increased affordability for more people. This compels us to rethink healthcare can be provided more holistically across the broad and changing healthcare landscape. One significant opportunity for improvement comes in chronic disease care. The 30 million people in the U.S. with three or more chronic diseases account for two-thirds of healthcare spending today, and the number of people is expected to grow to 80 million by 2030. ","Managing these chronic patients requires a multidisciplinary hands on approach Optum building in its next generation condition management programs. These include the management of emerging high cost specialty drugs, which are expected to continue to be a leading driver of medical costs inflation.","We address these trends through a broad range of approaches, including direct delivery of home and office infusion services, and direct delivery of specialty pharmacy prescriptions to the home with digital care services provided by Optum pharmacist to educate patients on how to properly take their medication.","Another challenge Optum is meeting head on is a dramatic rise in oncology drug spending. In the U.S. health system, misaligned incentives lead to administering higher cost oncology drugs unnecessarily. We do think there's a better way. Early results from our integrated OptumCare Cancer Center in Nevada suggests a decoupling oncology drug payments from Dr. Compensation can reduce pharmaceutical spending for seniors by nearly 30%.","It drives improved clinical quality based on the best science, while keeping the patients comfort, care and dignity as the highest priority. And ensuring physicians administering the care are paid fairly for their excellent work. ","We're exploring other new approaches along therapeutic lines such as chronic heart failure, and musculoskeletal conditions to more comprehensively address care needs of those with significant health challenges. The right delivery of care by physicians would be pivotal to this agenda, as OptumCare seeks to coordinate each patient's care journey with a focus on proactive, preventive medicine, especially for those with the most acute need.","Creating value for those we serve translates the stronger financial performance. Over just the last three years, the revenue per consumer served by OptumHealth has grown by nearly 50%. In the quarter OptumHealth total revenue grew 20% to $7.1 billion, while operating earnings advanced 21% to $688 million. ","Like OptumHealth, OptumInsight\u2019s positioning and capabilities have evolved over many years. OptumInsight has advanced from what was once primarily a point solution provider of technology to diversified enterprise solutions organization. The business has deep and broad expertise to solve some of the biggest challenges in healthcare for payers, providers, life science companies and governments.","Our new multi-year relationship with John Muir Health is distinctive in its comprehensive nature. John Muir is nationally recognized for quality of care as a major independent health system in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our relationship, funds revenue cycle, information technology, ambulatory care coordination, analytics procurement and consulting services.","The partnership will deliver broad performance improvement at John Muir and for its patients and physicians. With this another new relationship OptumInsight\u2019s second quarter backlog grew 20% year-over-year or more than $3 billion to $18.5 billion. Revenues advanced 7% to $2.3 billion and operating income increased 16% to $525 million.","OptumRx continues to evolve from a traditional PBM to a diversified pharmacy care services organization deeply focused clinically and enabled by vast data and ever improving technologies. This quarter we introduced a new and transparent digital consumer pricing tool. MyScript finder puts lower cost pharmaceutical alternatives and coverage status at people's fingertips. It offers instantaneous consumer relevant cost transparency with actual out of pocket costs based on pharmacy location, benefit plan design and deductible status. So far, consumers have conducted over 1 million searches in the first 60 days of usage.","OptumRx continue to win in the market. Its value is resonating with health plans, large employers and purchasing coalitions. We\u2019re driving greater pharmacy and medical care alignment, better service quality, lower costs, improved transparency, and an expanding breadth of services at the local market level, including home infusion, e-commerce specialty and community based dispensing services. ","As a result, OptumRx continues to profitably expand share. In the second quarter, revenues advanced by 12% to $18.9 billion and OptumRx added $11 million adjusted scripts year-over-year. These are just a few examples of the progress we've made and how the Optum businesses are advancing the way they serve in both their individual and market segments. And together as they deploy broad based market solutions, and yet we remain at the very early stages of what Optum can be.","Now I'll turn to John Rex, CFO of UnitedHealth Group.","John Rex ","Thank you, Andrew. Our first half positions us to perform well for the rest of the year. In the quarter, revenues grew 8% to $60.6 billion and net earnings from operations grew 13% to $4.7 billion. All of the business segments contributed strongly to these well balanced results. With previously discussed business transitions now effective as of mid-year, we're updating our full year revenue outlook.","With these incorporated, we expect 2019 revenue to be at or just slightly below the original $243 billion to $245 billion range. This reflects the transition of a large OptumRx client due to a business combination and are voluntary withdrawal from a state Medicaid program, partially offset by the DMG combination.","Cash flows from operations were $5.9 billion in the quarter and year-to-date are $9.1 billion or 1.3 times net income. For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations of $17.3 billion to $17.8 billion or 1.2 to 1.3 times net income. Medical costs remain well managed with our 2019 medical care ratio tracking well to the range we shared with you back in November of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. ","Unit cost remains a core driver of overall trend, and we continue to advance our efforts to optimize both site of service and use of the highest performing clinicians. We continue to expect that 2019 will mark the 11th consecutive year of declining inpatient admissions per 1,000 people. ","Our operating costs ratio of 13.9% is impacted by the deferral of the health insurer tax and a strong mix of productivity and operational improvement enterprise wide. And with our focus on affordability, that agenda is never really done. At the same time, we continue to aggressively expand the investments we are making in innovation to drive organic growth and further operational and productivity improvements over the decades to come.","In 2019, our effective tax rate is favorably impacted as expected by the deferral of the non-deductible health insurance tax. The second quarter rate was moderately higher than our original outlook. For the full year of 2019, we now expect the tax rate will likely be around 20.5%. That's the upper end of our original range for the year, which is fully incorporated in today's raised earnings outlook and is due impart to lower than expected employee stock-based compensation activity.","We continue to maintain balance sheet strength and significant flexibility. Return on equity in the second quarter again exceeded 25%. UnitedHealth Group has a long well developed and proven ability to thoughtfully deploy capital through business combinations that add capabilities and market presence to be leveraged across the enterprise, bringing both synergies and growth and costs.","In June, our Board of Directors raised our shareholder dividend by 20% to an annual rate of $4.32 per share. The dividend has advanced at or above 20% each year since initiated about a decade ago, and at about a 30% payout ratio has grown to be more in line with the market level objective we set. Still our long-term earnings growth potential provides ample capacity to continue to advance the dividend at strong rates for years to come.","We remain confident as we look forward to the second half of 2019. And now expect adjusted earnings per share of $14.70 to $14.90, an increase of $0.25 from the guidance we established at the end of last year. Within that, as previously discussed, the pacing of weekdays is higher in the third quarter this year, resulting in a relatively consistent level of earnings between the third and fourth quarters. ","Delivering on our 2019 commitments and strengthening our business further as we approach 2020 remain critical to us. Even as we pursue ever greater impact for society and advanced growth and returns for our shareholders for years to come.","With that, I'll turn it back to Dave. ","David Wichmann ","Thank you, John. We will continue investing for the future building, innovating and diversifying as we seek to support the development of the next generation health system, a system that provides high quality and efficient access for all, a system that achieves better outcomes and experiences at lower costs for people. This is the essential work of our enterprise. It provides us with an extraordinary opportunity and responsibility to help improve healthcare in the U.S. and globally, and to continue growing our business in these large and fast growing markets.","It is why if you spend time at our organization, you can feel the restlessness among our 320,000 dedicated professionals, all focused on making an impact in everything we do, and generating stronger societal and shareholder return.","And with that, let's open it up for questions. One question per caller, please, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake ","Thanks. Good morning. First, just let me congratulate and wish John Penshorn on a great retirement, well deserved, you\u2019ll be missed.","And then I've got a MLR question a couple parts. So bear with me. First, any color on quarterly medical trends, specifically, you saw very strong development in the quarter, any offsetting trend factors that we should think about? And then you're halfway through the year, can you give us an update on where you see MLR trending relative to the full year guidance of 82.5%? And lastly, you mentioned the days of the week, kind of impacting negatively to third quarter as they positively impact the Q1. So anything you could do to help us thinking about MLR in the third quarter relative to the 81% from last year. Thanks for bearing with me.","David Wichmann","Thanks. John Rex?","John Rex","Sure, Justin, good morning. So a few things, just thinking about first of all on your first point here on impacts on quarterly trends. So underlying trend as they stayed very much in line with our expectations, so no change in that in terms of the trend factors we lay out we've talked about and I would say even really no change in the components within that trend.","I would say kind of in terms of other things going on in the quarter within that nothing in the cost line. I mean I would point out that in the revenue line there's probably one item I could speak to that would have impact on that. So there's probably about roughly $100 million maybe a little bit more than $100 million of unfavorable revenue adjustment in the commercial business that was booked in the quarter.","So you recall there are risk adjustment factors that apply to commercial business for ACA compliant individual and small group products. And so that goes through over a long period of time, our data submissions have been and continue to be highly accurate on that. However, it's kind of a fixed pool in the end. And so there was a true up as there were auto adjustments on other plans, then what happens is that rolls through you get adjusted because of the fixed pool.","So that's one element that would have been rolling through in the quarter. And I'd size that in the tune of a kind of $100 million. So that doesn't show in reserves right that\u2019s the revenue adjustment a negative revenue adjustment. So that's one element I point out.","I think, in terms of kind of a combining your last two questions Justin, a little bit here. And so 3Q has that extra week day essentially a Monday, whereas -- and 1Q and that you can kind of see in the sequential progression even 1Q to 2Q, 1Q benefited from there being one less weekday than normal. So that does impact progression, whereas typically you would see 3Q is often than one of our higher earnings quarters and my comments, in my prepared comments I talked about kind of relatively stable EPS in between the two quarters. But you're right and thinking about that within the 3Q you should expect that MCR is impacted most like we got the benefit in the 1Q. Does that get at your questions, Justin. ","Justin Lake ","Just the MLR for the year the 82.5% and now that we're halfway through the year any anywhere you want us to kind of think about. You feel like you're on track with midpoint or slightly higher or slightly lower.","John Rex","We think we're tracking well on MLR for the year in that range. So -- and well kind of in that zone so nothing notable on that.","Justin Lake","Great, thank you very much. ","David Wichmann","Thank you, Justin. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about sort of the commercial membership here, I think at the Analysts Day you guys talked about sort of to see improving membership growth there. The quarter was relatively flat. Can you give us a sense on how we should be thinking about that as we think to the first year given some your comments today?","David Wichmann","Sure. Dirk do you want to address that?","Dirk McMahon","Yes. Let me start off in the fully insured area. We improved over the first quarter. We had nominal fully insured losses in 2Q. There's no notable areas to mention. We're confident that we price our book consistent with our trend forecast. And we actually see how our pricing approach actually pulled through to the earnings. So that's kind of the fully insured story.","As it relates to fee, we lost 80,000 members in the second quarter, but that's normal related to national account seasonal attrition. As we look at our fee business, throughout 2019, what we expect to see is that favorable membership growth above and beyond the acquisition that we made. So that's kind of the commercial membership story.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Charles. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll echo the congratulations to Mr. John Penshorn as well for all his help over the years. I'm curious about the John Muir announcement. I know you guys mentioned it. I'm curious, what makes it unique? Is it just the breadth of services? Or is it -- it sounds like a lot of things that you guys have been in the market doing. And then can you talk maybe a little bit more broadly about preparing large systems to take risk and why Optum thinks it's a good idea for these large systems to be taking more and more risk, even maybe starting with their own health plan.","And I guess last part of this, we're seeing a lot of the demand -- we're seeing a lot of the supply in the market from enablers of that type of technology and systems that are doing what Optum is doing. Is there demand that sort of matches that supply? I know it's kind of a lot of questions in there, but just sort of broadly on that topic.","David Wichmann","So maybe Eric can answer the specific question on John Muir and then we'll have Andrew Witty, take the second part there around preparing large systems. ","Eric Murphy","Yes, maybe I'll do first and second, if that's okay there, or first and third, sorry. Josh, thanks for the question Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. Our partnership with John Muir Health really represents one of the most comprehensive in the healthcare industry, between a delivery system and a health care services company. The integrated scope of services includes acute and ambulatory revenue cycle management end-to-end information technology services, ambulatory care coordination, enterprise analytics, purchasing and consulting services.","It is very unique in the marketplace in that health system has never contemplated putting out that much of a scope of work on both the back office as well as what I'd call the middle office of a delivery system. So it is quite unique and first in the industry, and Optum is ideally suited to be able to address those expansive needs of John Muir Health. ","In terms of the third part of your question, our market knowledge suggests that several hundred regional health systems have similar size and market opportunity as John Muir. We\u2019re already in discussions with several high performing independent community based systems and look forward to establishing continued partnerships, similar to John Muir Health, with health systems across the industry.","Andrew, do you want to take the second part?","Andrew Witty","Yes. Thanks, Eric. And thanks, Josh, for the question. I mean, clearly, we have a very strong view that the best way forward in terms of improving quality bringing down total cost of care is to increasingly new towards value in terms of the management of the care continuum. That is very much the focus of the OptumCare strategy and is resonant throughout all of our various platforms. But it's also very clear that we're seeing more and more systems begin to look to move in that direction.","Where as they look to Optum, they can see portfolios of information systems, skills, which have been developed within our own organization, which are going to be just as useful within those systems as they are within for example, our OptumCare organization. So for us, this is a very important opening up of a new front in terms of the opportunity to develop our interventions in the marketplace, and we believe move to a more sustainable high quality, lower cost healthcare environment.","Josh Raskin","Thank you. ","David Wichmann","Thank you, Josh. Next question, please. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Borsch","Yes, I was hoping maybe you could comment on the -- how you're looking at the -- if you're continuing with the same PBM rebate strategy that you focused on. And did that looks any different now that the administration has decided to withdraw from the ban in rebates in Medicare.","David Wichmann","Good question, Matt. Our decisions around rebates and the application of them where pharmacy pricing protection doesn't exist and an existing policy was made independent of any pending regulation and it was done so well over a year ago now, or so. So our commitment to that remains, I think you know that there's, of the policies that exists particularly in the commercial market about 75% of them already have pharmacy price protection mechanisms in them like a copay, whereas the other 25%, and I'm generalizing here, but the other 25% don't.","And when that is the case, in particular, when it intersects with some of the legacy high deductible health plans there, it was really compelling for us to drive rebates to the point of sale to create greater affordability for consumers. We just felt that that was the right consumer response. ","So that won't change, as we think about moving forward, there are some legislation on HDHP yesterday, which I thought was pretty forward leaning, which allows for greater flexibilities around managing high deductible health plans that would give us greater flexibility as a market leader in that segment to be able to modify those policies and offer a greater range that allows us to be able to deal with the breadth of issues that arise with those policies intersecting with individuals with chronic disease.","So we're looking forward also to bringing out new policies that are more responsive broadly to consumer expectations. So you can expect us not to change our stance on rebates.","Matthew Borsch","Okay, thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Matt. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from David Windley with Jeffries. Please go ahead.","David Windley","Hi, thanks. Maybe combining a couple of questions. Dave, to your last answer, on this rebate policy and thinking about membership -- commercial membership, I believe the company has said that it is requiring any new customers to go to a point of sale rebate regime is that having a positive or negative affecting in your selling in commercial?","David Wichmann","So there's two elements to this, first was the 8 million to 9 million or so people that are covered with or have a point of sale rebates applied in our fully insured markets, that is pretty close to being done. That was commenced effective January 1, 2019 on renewal date. So we still have some renewals that will take place as a result of that. The impact of that has been $130 per eligible script savings and as much as a 16% improvement in adherence. So we're going to monitor that and really evaluate what the long-term implications are on individual health and the overall use of healthcare resources.","The second piece, again, relates to those opportunities that come to us from January 1, 2020 and beyond, that have no pharmacy price protection mechanism in the plan design, which again, would be about 25% of the total plan design. In those situations, we would only take on that case in the -- if we were able to apply rebates at the point of sale, I'm speaking for UnitedHealthcare at this stage. So those are the -- that's the plan for us going forward.","In terms of implication, so, there has been no implication with respect to the -- that policy adoption. The one thing we did see pretty quickly thereafter is a lot more interest on the part of large employers and possibly applying the same policy recognizing that consumers are at risk if they have a high cost drugs and policy features that don't protect them from inflation on those drugs.","David Windley","Thank you. ","David Wichmann","Thank you, David. Next question, please.","Operator","Next question is from a Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. Just want to get a bit more color on the guidance raise. You raised, the quarter I guess by more than you beat consensus, consensus isn\u2019t always where I guess the company is thinking the numbers are going to be for the quarter. But how much of the guidance raise reflects kind of just the upside that you report in a quarter versus kind of flowing through that upside into out quarters, versus some of the deals that you've closed since last quarter. If you could break into the three components, that would be great. ","David Wichmann","The raise reflect the overall confidence we have in the performance of the business, as we sit here today and our prospects for growth. But also, as we look forward to the future as well, but John, can you adjust to the details?","John Rex","Sure, Kevin. So I'd say and the last part of your comment, in terms of any transactions closed immaterial, really, in terms of in terms of what we're doing here today. So those will be, just not that impactful in 2019 to even be noticeable. So really, not about that. I think we tried to show you kind of an impact in terms of the investment income line, in terms of the venture gain that we recognized in the quarter to help level set somewhat on that, in terms of the impact that it had in the in the quarter itself.","I think the other component, I would just say that I mentioned in my prepared comments, at least, compared to our outlook, also the tax rate came in about a bit higher for us in the quarter. So providing some offset on that. And then I think in response to Justin's question, I pointed out kind of another impact that was yet another offset on that.","So a lot of those factors kind of, as I go through that you can see within the quarter, pretty much washing out in terms of that impact. Does that help, Kevin?","Kevin Fischbeck","Yes, I think that helps. I guess you're saying though, that when you break it out, it's been mostly within the quarter or is it the split between the quarter and rest of the year.","John Rex","I\u2019ll be clear on that. So what I was saying is, in terms of when you look at kind of the impact in the quarter and kind of that go. So what I called out was that we talked about the venture gain, we talked about some other elements that go -- that offset that. So really that drags in, in terms of kind of how we're feeling about our full year and kind of the optimism confidence we have in the full year. Because some of those quarterly elements really wash out.","Kevin Fischbeck","Perfect, thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Kevin. Next question, please. ","Operator","We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser ","Hi, good morning. So my questions are around kind of like what we're hearing out of DC. Obviously, the rebate rule is out, but we have some -- couple of new proposals wanted to get your view on them. So the first one, the administration put out recently an executive order that looked at increasing price transparency in healthcare, including requiring providers and insurance to provide or facilitate some access to information about negotiate rates. So I wanted to see kind of like how you think about this, and the potential impact on the competitive dynamics?","And secondly, back in May, House Ways [ph] and means kind of like an unveiled its legislation that it would shift to risk of catastrophic coverage, and look at a donut hole from patients and the government to health plans and manufacturers. How do you think about this? Is this yet just another proposal that would ultimately result in higher premium and therefore would be shelved? Or what potential impact do you think it could have on you? Thank you.","David Wichmann","There's a lot of policies and proposals and proposed regulation activity going on today. And it's in part mixed with the political campaigns. So there's a lot to -- there's a lot out there. And some of that is subjected to formal processes and others is more just direct commentary. And so our -- I think here for this purpose, we would probably restrict our commentary to general types of themes as opposed to find ourselves commenting outside of the formal process.","But -- so I just maybe emphasize a few things here. One is, as it relates to drug prices in particular, I think it's fairly clear now that there's that drug companies set these prices. I think one of the things that was implied in a rebate rule was important emphasis on continuing the PBM\u2019s rule as a counterbalance against those list prices increases, but also direct recognition of the strong value PBMs bring not only in the management of procurement, but also as they manage the pharmacy benefit, as well as in the case of OptumRx distinct value that comes with the intersection of all of that with the medical benefit, driving considerable additional value.","We save consumers about $2,000 per year, per consumer in these activities. And I think that folks are starting to realize that and really value it. So I think that that will weigh heavily on whatever ultimately comes out. Also, I think you've also seen that we began bringing really strong value to people through this application of rebates at the point of sale. Really to ensure that consumers are protected from these list price increases overall to the best of our abilities and we'll continue to pursue those activities.","And so I think that covers off your -- the kind of the commentary you had about the rebate rule. And the second piece as it relates to the House Ways and means donor hole. Do we have any specific commentary on -- further commentary on that looks like not. So we'll just stick with that response for now. ","Thank you, Ricky. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal ","Thanks a lot guys. You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, I guess, the one thing on the guidance that you didn't touch is the OCR ratio 14.4% to 15%, I think was the last guy, it seems like it's tracking a little light there. So that's really just my question any color there? And maybe just if I could sneak one more. On the PPD, we would love to know what was entry year verse prior year inside of the 270? Thanks so much.","David Wichmann","John?","John Rex","Yes. Hi, Steve. Yes, no change on our OCR outlook for the year. Though as you kind of if you look at the year-over-year. I'm sure you're well aware the primary change in the OCR is driven by the health insurance tax that gets being offset by strong efficiency and productivity gains. And then of course, we continue to make significant ongoing strategic investments in our businesses. So -- but no change from the outlook, we still expect to be in the guidance range of 14.7% plus or minus 30 basis points for the year.","Steve Tanal ","And the PPD side. ","David Wichmann","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. Maybe just ask about MA now the bids are in for 2020. I know the company stressed the last few years\u2019 consistency of benefits. We'll get the health insurance be coming back next year. Do you feel like, you'll be able to maintain, at least in a broad sense, consistency of benefits next year and it looks like two of your major competitors in the space that have grown extraordinarily this year have done so via really deploying those benefits of the hip moratorium this year. And presumably they may have to look at that next year. Do you see an opportunity maybe for a little bit of accelerated growth, if you can be consistent next year?","David Wichmann","Good question, A.J.. I really applaud our team's efforts and how they thought through this on a multi-year basis. Brian, you want to give him some details?","Brian Thompson","Sure. Thanks for the question, A.J. To your point, obviously the tax is returning in 2020. As I\u2019ve said before, we will measured and discipline and how we went to market inside 2019. Certainly mindful of that tax headwind returning. I would say our multi-year approach was a critical factor in shaping our optimism around 2020. Our goal and intention is to keep our benefits largely stable to improving despite these headwinds. So, right now, I would say that we're really pleased with our product positioning going into next year and a foundational element was our discipline in 2019.","David Wichmann","Thank you, A.J. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Good morning, and good luck to John Penshorn and congrats to Brad or maybe that should be the other way around. My questions is on DMG, I want to talk about -- the performance of that has been fairly weak over the last few years. And now that you've got it the transaction closed and it's yours. How will you improve the performance of that business? And how quickly do you think you can bring some improved earnings to the bottom-line there?","David Wichmann","Thank you, Peter, for the question. We're pleased to close the transaction out your extraordinarily long time. Dr. Wyatt Decker is here. Wyatt, do you want to talk about what you're doing at DMG?","Wyatt Decker","Yes. Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Peter for the question. At OptumHealth, our care platform we call OptumCare is building the nation's leading value-based physician led and patient focused health care system. We're very pleased to have completed the acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which combines another leading medical center with our practice.","We feel confident that as we provide our clinical expertise, analytics and services to the DaVita Medical practices, you will see enhanced performance of the DaVita Medical Group and integration with our leading value based practices. Thank you. ","David Wichmann","So Peter, we are pretty pleased with how DaVita transitioned over. Having done -- bring down diligence and looking at the run rate or the performance of the business. So we were pretty pleased with that. And so the foundation from which we will improve that practice and drive the type of synergies that we expect was there. And so we have high confidence you'll start to see some meaningful contributions from that platform in 2020 and beyond.","Thanks for the question, Peter. Next question, please. ","Operator","Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. It's clear the value United and insurers are creating for healthcare affordability and quality when you look at the historical industry cost trend of 7% to 8% being brought down to 6% range with consumerism. And now you have a peer talking about future trends in below 2% range benchmark to medical CPI granted they have some skewing from ASL inclusion. And Dave at a conference last month, you mentioned national health expenditures plus or minus is interesting construct to consider medical costs trend. ","So I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on how you think about the right framework for talking about cost trend, whether it's CPI or NHE and if it is national health expenditures, which runs in the mid-5, how do you think about United\u2019s business model being able to produce long-term trend in line or better than national health expenditure trend?","David Wichmann","That's a really thoughtful question, Sarah. So a couple of things. First, we have begun to look at it more closely and thinking about whether how we are contributing to bringing a greater affordability more broadly across the segment of Medicare, Medicaid in commercial. And have started to evaluate that against NHE to determine again, whether we are a contributor to trend or whether we are actually reducing trend.","And so that that's something that I think you'll hear more about from us. The other is as we sit here, we oftentimes talk in commercial trend context in these settings. All the while, we have a very robust and large government programs based business. And those obviously have trends inside them as well. So we're trying to think about a way to bring forward a view of that more broadly. So you can assess our aggregate performance across our business.","We -- so NHE will be important in that respect. It is a complicated metric in many respects, I can -- I think I can safely say that we are contributing positively to reducing the nation's healthcare burden. And that healthcare burden has been declining over the course of the more recent past. And we would aim very hard to continue to move that forward, recognizing that the way to get that done is to advanced quality first and foremost, which is really the improving outcomes. And then the evaluation of and making sure that we drive efficiency in the use of the nation's healthcare resources in achieving that quality, and then not missing the opportunity to improve the patient experience as well.","So this is a very high priority for this organization to contribute in a constructive way to reducing the overall healthcare burden in the U.S. And we believe you can see that in some of the remarks that, informing the health system through the application of the IHR, engaging people and managing their health conditions more proactively through the Raleigh platform and aligning the reward system in healthcare to drive that triple A value is essential to achieving that. And that's the essence of the commentary that I began this call with today.","We would add a fourth element to that and that was really around our physicians and providing them a work environment or environment where they can practice medicine, the way they've been trained and to allow them to the freedoms without burnout to be able to deliver solid, high quality outcomes and results for their patient base. And we believe that OptumCare is and UnitedHealthcare broadly is creating just that environment.","Thank you for the question, Sarah. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Lance Wilkes","Yes, just had a question with respect to the drivers of growth over in the Optum side of the business. I was wondering for Optum Health, for its growth, how much of that growth was driven from risk taking or the shift to value based reimbursement and however on the PBM side how much was driven by increased use of specialty home delivery?","David Wichmann","Tom Roos, do you want to take that? ","Tom Roos","Sure. Thanks very much, Lance. Appreciate the question. So when we look at the growth at Optum broadly, very significant growth and really good market acceptance around the risk taking that we have in OptumCare, and continue to expect to see growth there. As well in other parts of OptumHealth, very much seeing growth in the Optum serve part of the business, which is the part of the business that serves the federal employees as well as military veterans\u2019 part of our business. ","And you may recall earlier in the year we announced at the end of last year, we had received a new contract for a community care network. And with that, we were awarded three regions. And when we were awarded that we expected that we would have about 6 million potential new members in there over the next several years and we've driven very well at the implementation of regions one, and two. And just continuing to drive success in that market. And then the other area that I would focus on is Optum financial services as well. ","One of the leading health services, financial institutions with about 5.5 million consumer accounts and very significant growth in assets under management as well. And just continuing to really drive growth in that part of the market to really help with tools and capabilities for consumers to be able to drive decision making that they use to access care and to be able to fund and serve those individuals as they're making decisions around care choices, and affordability.","So really good solid growth in that area, as well, I would say in the PBM the really strong acceptance of pharmacy care services models, you see the wins that both Dave and Andrew talked about in script and in their prepared comments, just really solid growth in that area. ","And then also on OptumInsight, strong acceptance in terms of market approach on large deals like the recent announcement of John Muir Health and the strength of bringing healthcare technology services into that part of the market to be able to help with moving the risk and also being able to be more effective in delivering care to consumers and individuals. ","So I would look at the full spectrum and say really good, solid opportunities to drive good organic growth that we've been seeing across all of Optum.","David Wichmann","Good question, Lance. Hopefully you read in all that that even we oftentimes showcase certain elements in the call here, but there's a very strong underlying and diverse base of businesses inside Optum that are advancing value to consumers on and the health system broadly on multiple different dimensions.","We are running short of time. So I think we can take two more questions. And then we'll conclude the call. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Michael Newshel with Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open. ","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Going back to the history, is there any talent with embedded into the 2019 guidance now for midyear commercial intervals that they can return to the fee for the 2020 months of similar to what you saw in 2017?","John Rex","So yes, so just -- thanks for your question there. So not meaningful in terms of any kind of impact there. But every year so we're getting a little familiar with things like this that come in and out of the outlook here. So kind of individually discrete factors that may influence the annual growth rate, I wouldn't call it meaningful in terms of any kind of impact on that for 2019.","But yes, this thing will come back again in 2020, comes in, in and out, it seems to insert some in year impact. While given the diversity of our business space, it's usually, really not all that material for us. We look at it as kind of a -- an element that should be addressed here ultimately as you reintroduce that to the system. But nothing material that I call out in the 2019 outlook.","Michael Newshel","All right. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. I'm surprised that no one has asked about this. Any initial commentary on sort of 2020 and specifically if you can size the hist [ph] and headwinds, in terms of just size dollars there. And whether or not that'll hinder your ability to grow within your 13% to 16% target range at this point? Thanks.","John Rex","Sure. Well, no, I guess, I'll start by saying I appreciate the valiant attempt to 2020 guidance, which we won't be providing here today. And keeping that long held custom we will provide some initial thoughts in October with our third quarter earnings call and then we'll provide really detailed view at our investor conferences as we always do. I will offer a few thoughts, because I think you asked a good thoughtful question there.","So first as it relates to our 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth objective is just that, but long-term outlook not meant to be a single quarter or a single year point estimate. I think as I reflect back a little bit, let\u2019s say over the last decade or so, let's see. So we've through today reported 42 quarters, right. I'd say annual average growth rate over that period has been 18%, but including where I expect to land in 2019, we had seven quarters that have all been well above or within that 13% to 16% target and four that were below. ","If I call a little more granularity, I think about 42 quarters, we've had 28 that were in or above that guidance range and 14 were below. So it's a pretty strong batting average against the long-term growth rate. And we expect it's going to continue to be quite strong for the decade to come. But it's a long-term growth rate, and we manage the business to sustain that growth in the future. We don't -- typically there aren't in discrete individual factors that we see as that have really influenced that and I can think about many factors that have occurred over the course of this company, whether it was going back to stars or other elements or years where Medicare rates were not -- where we're different than maybe expected.","The hit is just the favor that comes in and out and openly passes through also. I think a few things that, I know you're all well aware of here though, it is a cost that's ultimately shouldered by American families, small businesses and seniors. It's a non-deductable task to comes in and you've seen it come in and out. And I know you all are deeply aware of the mechanics and for us, it\u2019s just mechanics passes through. But it comes in and out and cut insert year, end year impact sometimes when it comes in and out.","As I said in the last -- response to last question, given the diversity of our business, it's just not really all that material to us. But it's noticeable that, things like I'd point out that, again, you're well aware of non-deductible nature of the tax alone adds 300 to 400 basis points to our effective tax rate. That's just the math of it. There's the calendar year versus policy year differentials on the commercial business, I can go on. But I'm confident that after several years of this, by now you're all aware of those impacts.","David Wichmann","Right. Thank you, John. Thank you all. So I\u2019d just like to maybe sum up where we are, as we close out this call. UnitedHealth Group ended the first half of 2019 with considerable momentum delivering strong, well balanced earnings growth across all of our businesses. It's with confidence that we're expanding -- with our expanding capabilities and available growth opportunities that we increased our outlook for full year adjusted earnings per share.","Optum and UnitedHealthcare both perform strongly in the quarter. Both are focused on lowering costs and improving health outcomes and the consumer experience as they seek to help advance the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. A system that provides high quality, efficient and fair access for all. This concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. You may now disconnect. And have a great day."],"21143":["Unitedhealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 16, 2012  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Stephen J.

This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 16, 2012, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. Third quarter revenues were $27.3 billion, increasing 8% year-over-year again this quarter. Earnings grew 28% to $1.50 per share, benefiting from strong revenue growth and improved operating margins.","Our third quarter 2012 operating margin of 9.6% reflects strong performance on clinical affordability and favorable reserve developments, resulting in the consolidated medical care ratio of 79%. Sharp margin improvement at Optum further contributed to the 140 basis point expansion in consolidated operating margin.","Operating costs grew seasonally to 15.7% of revenues. Execution across our enterprise continues to be strong and our financial flexibility remains distinctive.","Adjusted cash flows from operations of $2.4 billion in the third quarter brought year-to-date cash flow to $5.5 billion, a 9% year-over-year advance.","We ended the quarter at the ratio of debt to debt plus equity of 30% and have $1.6 billion in nonregulated cash on hand.","Last week, we announced our merger with Amil, the leading Brazilian health care company. We see expansive, early-stage market opportunities there, and we expect Amil will become a distinctive growth platform for both our Health Benefits and Health Services segments.","The rating agencies all reaffirmed our ratings subsequent to our announcement. Standard & Poor's had upgraded our corporate debt rating to A with a stable outlook in September; making UnitedHealth Group the highest-rated, publicly traded managed care organization they follow.","Our unique business diversity was key factor for S&P, along with strong cash flow generated from operations. And also during the quarter, we were honored to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.","Let's review third quarter performance by business, beginning with UnitedHealthcare, which advanced third quarter revenues 8% year-over-year to $25.5 billion, and operating earnings 26% to $2.2 billion.","UnitedHealthcare has added 2 million people through the first 9 months of 2012. This includes net growth of 670,000 people this quarter alone, record organic growth for a third quarter. Major new clients this quarter included the initiation of health benefit services for state employees in Texas and Nebraska. We're honored to serve the employees of these states and their families.","UnitedHealthcare grew fee-based commercial benefits by 1.5 million people in the third quarter, bringing 9-month growth to 1.25 million people. Commercial risk-based business remained flat this quarter. The commercial environment continues to be characterized by persistently weak employment and new business formation.","The pricing intensity we see at local market levels remains unchanged from the last several quarters. Our offerings remain very competitive across the value spectrum due to our strong cost positions, effective care management, operating cost disciplines and innovative benefit designs and features. But we will remain disciplined on margins and continue to price to our forward view of underlying costs, including the insurer's fee. As we hold to these pricing disciplines, we expect to continue to lose moderate levels of risk-based membership in the near term, as we have for the last several quarters.","Our Medicare and Medicaid businesses contributed strongly to UnitedHealthcare's third quarter growth performance, together adding more than 165,000 people over the last 90 days. We grew by 35,000 seniors in Medicare Advantage and 70,000 Medicaid beneficiaries joined UnitedHealthcare plans. We made the decision, together with the state of Wisconsin, to end our contract serving 175,000 people in one product in the Milwaukee market as of November 1, while we continue to serve 125,000 people statewide.","UnitedHealthcare Community & State was awarded the opportunity to serve more than 20,000 dual eligible beneficiaries in Ohio beginning in April of 2013. This was part of the country's first Medicare and Medicaid eligible program award integrating all services, from comprehensive medical to long-term care to pharmacy benefits to behavioral health. We offer all of these services and are deeply experienced and skilled in integrating them to better respond to challenges for these beneficiaries.","UnitedHealthcare's 8.6% operating margins strengthened, ahead of both our expectations and last year's third quarter results. Our full year 2012 commercial medical cost trend benchmark is likely to come in around 5.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","Third quarter earnings benefited from reserve development, and we now project a full year 2012 consolidated medical care ratio in the range of 80.5%, based on the strong year-to-date results and the sharp seasonal increase in cost expected in the fourth quarter.","We believe our consumer education and engagement efforts and our clinical management and affordability programs are meaningfully impacting the cost curve for our businesses. With benefit design improvements and effective outreach and population health management, we're increasingly helping patients receive care from the best doctors and have better suited more cost-appropriate sites of services.","We have also grown our performance-based payment programs, which are approaching an annual run rate of $17 billion or 18% of our in-network medical spend and our ability to detect inaccuracies and erred in claim submission and, therefore, to pay more fairly and appropriately for services rendered. Together, these capabilities deliver fundamental value to clients by improving the overall affordability of the products they buy.","Looking ahead to 2013, UnitedHealthcare's business plan is built on record customer growth, led by TRICARE and National Accounts, and strong performance in the public and senior sector. We expect UnitedHealthcare's performance in the Public and Senior Markets will be highlighted by continued market competitive Medicare Advantage offerings, continued Medicaid expansions and the compelling new Medicare Part D product offering that fully leverages our PBM capabilities.","We expect commercial risk business to continue to be down moderately in a price-sensitive market, as we adjust our pricing to reflect our forward view of medical costs, trends and cost increases for the insurance fee provisions of the Affordable Care Act. We continue to expect generally lower gross margin percentage across UnitedHealthcare's risk-based businesses in 2013, as we said last quarter.","For the longer term, our view remains strongly positive. We believe UnitedHealthcare is building a distinctive health benefits franchise by aligning benefit design, consumer engagement, clinical program management and network usage. This alignment continues to deliver sustainable cost and performance advantages, growth, and deeper, richer relationships with consumers and physicians across all benefit categories.","Moving to Health Services. Optum continues to progress steadily, in line with the long-term expectations we set out nearly a year ago at our Investor Conference. Even in these initial stages as the enterprise becomes what we refer to as One Optum, the results foreshadow some of the acceleration and impact of expanded capacities that will become even more apparent as it matures in 2013 and 2014.","Optum's third quarter revenues were $7.2 billion, and operating earnings of $408 million grew 28% year-over-year. Importantly, all segments showed year-over-year and sequential quarterly operating margin gains, benefiting from growth and from the simplification and integration investments made in the first half of this year.","The initiatives and investments that underline the One Optum strategy continue and should benefit 2013 and '14. Third quarter revenue growth was led by OptumHealth, up 19% year-over-year; and OptumInsight, up 15% year-over-year. Optum Insight's revenue backlog continues to grow and now stands at $4.5 billion, up more than $700 million or 19% year-over-year. The depth and quality of our customer relationships are increasing as the market becomes more familiar with our Optum offerings. Some examples of new third quarter sales illustrate Optum's diverse and broad market reach.","For a specialty drug maker, we will measure over multiple years the in-market clinical performance of a high-profile product. For a major care delivery system, we will provide technology and services to enable the development of competencies in population health and risk management. For a variety of health plans, we will deliver medical care to members through our integrated care clinics. For employers and freestanding drug benefit programs, we'll manage pharmacy benefits, including their rebate programs. And many more examples could be offered.","Optum is making steady progress in strengthening its margins by addressing its overall cost structure, operating, processes and deeper product and business integration. We are committed to a higher performance, more responsive, more agile enterprise, consistent with results that have been realized over the years through similar approaches applied at UnitedHealthcare.","We expect these improvements will strengthen performance for customers and unlock the scale advantage that should accrue from Optum's strong, sustainable top line growth. We have added seasoned, talented executives and aligned the organization to support more comprehensive solutions and deeper customer partnerships. We are focusing product development on these larger, broader opportunities, while continue to execute on always important, individual product sales, day in and day out.","Our long-term view for Optum's potential remains exceptionally positive. This is a competency-based platform with leading assets that are applicable to serving a broad variety of channels. Serving customer relationships across the full expense of a health system that needs to evolve and improve performance. We operate in an emerging health services marketplace, characterized by fragmented suppliers who typically are offering narrow products instead of broader-based solutions. If we focus on our clients and the challenges they face and deliver strong execution around solutions, Optum has dramatic growth potential.","So in sum, 2012 continues to be a strong year for our enterprise at this point. Our results show growth and balance across virtually all our businesses. We have achieved revenue growth, further diversification and stronger margins, and we continue to develop and position our businesses and business leaders for the future. With Tom Paul taking an important new role as UnitedHealthcare's Chief Consumer Officer, and Jack Larsen and Steve Nelson, both strong veteran leaders, now running respectively Medicare & Retirement and Community & State for UnitedHealthcare, 2012 should finish out strongly.","The fourth quarter is challenging from a seasonality perspective and as you know, bears a heavy cost burden as we prepare for new January volumes and related benefit changes and as we work through the intense Medicare selling and enrollment season.","That said, excluding any potential impact from Amil, we expect the year 2012 to end in a revenue range approaching $110 billion and an earnings per share range of $5.20 to $5.25 per share, with strong operating cash flows of approximately $7 billion.","Quarter-by-quarter, across the UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare and Optum platforms, we have been improving our products and services, executing more consistently and more strongly, diversifying steadily and regularly advancing innovations to better serve the needs of our customers. Organic growth has been strong and distinctive in both 2011 and 2012. Medical and operating costs have been well managed, with more opportunities in front of us. And as a result, we've been consistently delivering more value to the wide, diverse and growing customer base be serve. We expect strong execution to continue in 2013.","But as we have said in previous calls, given the weak business climate and employment outlook in the United States, the mounting pressures in federal state budgets, to mention just a few some of the challenges, we continue to be cautious about 2013 earnings performance. We expect to grow revenues and earnings per share in 2013, but we view the current consensus level as the considerable challenge from this distance, given these market conditions.","We certainly expect to continue to grow broadly across our businesses in 2013, with the exception of commercial risk-based membership. We continue to expect pressure on margins across all benefit markets. We have TRICARE implementation and PBM in sourcing to add to the operating challenges, as well as the growth opportunities.","Optum should remain rock solid on its plan to continue to increase its contribution to our overall performance. And Amil is expected to be slightly accretive, but not really expected to be much of a factor in the earnings next year.","2012 had significant favorable performance attributes, starting with favorable medical cost trends, reserve development and rebate true-ups that we cannot assume will carry into 2013 with similar levels of impact. We will introduce our first view of 2013 to you at our Investor Conference in just over a month from now.","As 2012 closes, we continue to generate significant growth momentum. Our customers are responding to the distinctive competencies that underlie products and services access from both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. We will continue to focus on fundamental execution with the goal of creating value, both for those we serve and for shareholders.","In the meantime, our team is here to take your questions about market development and 2012 performance. Please, let's hold to one question per person. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to ask you about the commercial pricing and cost trend environment. I mean in particular, of course we noticed the lower outlook on trend now at 5.5%, down from your prior outlook. Can you just talk through the components of your view that changed during the quarter and also maybe just dovetail that with whether you've seen any change on the pricing side as well?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure, I think Dan might be the best to be begin that.","Dan Schumacher","Matt, this is Dan Schumacher. So on the cost trend side, stepping into 2012, we did have an expectation of higher utilization as compared to 2011. We are actually seeing that, although I will tell you it is more moderate than we thought. We saw a surge in the first quarter utilization, and then that moderated from the second quarter forward. And I think beyond the consumer behaviors underneath that, I think what we are seeing is some really strong contributions from our medical affordability agenda. We work across the health care landscape, whether it be inpatient management focused on the most appropriate site of service, most appropriate course of treatment, all the way through to payment integrity; fraud, waste and abuse; and strong delivery, frankly, from our contracting, aligning more around value and quality outcomes. So all of those things are making a difference for us. As you look at the components of it, I guess I would take you back to the Investor Conference guidance and update the components from there. First on inpatient, we are seeing a little better inpatient. Again, that's really our strong management on 1-day lengths of stay, observations, conversions and things like that. We are seeing a little bit more moderate pharmacy utilization, particularly in the space of Hep C. We're seeing relatively stable position, and outpatient is actually a little bit higher than our expectation. And we continue to have strong programs really focused on the site of service behind the outpatient setting. So all of that informs our revised view of 5.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. And then I think I'll turn to Jeff to talk a little bit about the pricing environment.","Jeff Alter","Matt, it's Jeff Alter. Yes, on a general basis, we have said this before, we expected and have been seeing a more competitive market environment around commercial pricing. I don't think it's changed. It's about the same as it has been since the first few quarters of this year. So not really a market change in the third quarter. But as you know, our approach hasn't changed for a very long time. Our approach and discipline remain intact. And as Steve mentioned, we believe the result of that will be some loss of commercial risk-based membership over the next, call it 6 months. And in relation to the discussion or the answer that Dan gave, we have a very disciplined process that takes a forward view of costs. And as medical trend changes and expectations change, and some of those results change, we look across those 350 intersections of MLR. And then look at a couple other factors and try to come up with the answer that will optimize our results in each one of those given markets. So that has remained unchanged. What has changed, I think internally, is we are able to get some of these changes into our pricing much quicker than we had in the past. So...","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to talk a little bit about the commentary you made on 2013 consensus. Steve, you mentioned that, that will be a challenge. I think the consensus first is the mid-point of your current -- of your updated 2012 is about 7% growth. So I guess a couple of things on that. We've heard from the company before that it's a double-digit earnings grower. Are we just -- in sort of last couple of years, we're just sort of not seeing necessarily all of that, if you take out some of these one timers? So are we thinking about the growth trajectory wrong? You guys seem comfortable that Optum is still on pace to double by '15. And then I guess you mentioned pricing for the industry fee. Is that having a bigger effect? Is there a net income impact next year? And maybe specifically, how you plan on accounting for that?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, Josh, I think that is like 6 questions rolled into 1. I really commend you for that. Our view in terms of the outlook of our business is unchanged. We have seen these kinds of challenges in the marketplace and I think we have been successful in navigating through them over the last couple of years. But that doesn't deter us from recognizing that we need to continue to operate and focus on that basis, that the economic environment has not changed, the employment outlook really has not changed. It doesn't appear to us to be -- the reimbursement environment relative to the federal and state budgets, arguably has gotten even more intense. The impact of the reform act, including the insurance fee, really begins to get in -- to come into play, as we set to begin the rate development process for 2013. So we are respectful of those elements and intend to engage them and to perform to our maximum potential through those, and are perhaps more cautious than those who set consensus of those factors at this distance as we look into 2013. If you actually take a look at our actual performance, I think it has been pretty strong over the last couple of years and we are certainly focused and actually think we are more capable and stronger than we have been in those past years. But we have to strike an appropriate balance there. And that's really all we are saying. We expect to grow revenue in earnings in 2013. We're really not intending to give you more specifics or color on 2013 guidance, other than to maintain a sober balance in terms of some of the headwinds that we see. And on a, from a growth perspective, we consider these to be kind of the headwinds of perhaps the next couple of years. But if you really take a look at the growth potential of this enterprise, the market expansions that are in front of it over the long term, Optum is performing well. It is maturing. It is gaining momentum. And we fully expect to be in line with our kind of the guidance, the longer-term guidance we set at last year's Investor Conference. So no discouragement along those lines, and I don't know what else to offer.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I understand, Steve, you're not going to give sort of specific guidance. But you talked about industry fees, so I'm just curious what the impact there is? Are you -- is there a specific percentage you're assuming that the fee will come in at as a percentage of premiums? And are you accruing for that in '13? Is that the idea?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, so it's coming into play in 2013 because it applies in that fashion. Maybe Dan Schumacher can address the insurance fee.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. So with respect to the accounting, the insurance fee is assessed in 2014 based on 2013 premiums. So we will begin at -- accruing for it in 2014 as premiums are earned, and we will actually make the payment in January of 2014. So that's kind of mechanically how it works.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And you're accruing in '14?","Dan Schumacher","No, we're accruing in '14 for the fee. With respect to pricing in the commercial business, we have annual policies. So those policies that begin February forward in 2013, they have months that carry then into 2014. So we are increasingly reflecting the health insurance tax in those renewals, so that we capture the cost of that tax in '14, in our premiums in '13.","Operator","And we'll go next to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to follow up here on the commentary, specifically around the revenue growth. Yes, obviously a strong year here across just about all the businesses on the membership side. Is there anything you can talk to just in terms of anything we should be thinking about structurally in terms of the growth that you saw in 2011 or should I say, 2012 that may or may not continue into 2013, and whether that's the strong commercial ASO business? That Medicare Advantage results? Yes, I know you had a good Part D bidding season. Just curious if there's anything we should be thinking about in terms of nonrepetitive?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think I'll let Gail and Larry comment with respect to their business platforms, but the item that we really highlighted is really no different than '12, and that is continued moderation in terms of commercial risk. But Gail, do you want to...","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Thanks, Steve. From an overall perspective as you've seen from the benefits side of the business, we've had a very strong growth trajectory over the last several years, including this year in 2012. As we think about the positioning of each of our businesses, certainly, we're coming and still into the final pieces of our selling season for 2013, but feel we're well positioned in the commercially ASO side and think we will have another strong national account season. Again, that's part of the positioning around our consumer facing products, our value-based benefit design, the innovation that we're bringing to the market. So we feel positive about our positioning in the commercial ASO side. As Steve mentioned in his opening comments around commercial risk, it's a very competitive market we're seeing extremely disciplined around that pricing components of that and we'd expect to see membership decline. But again, feel good about the positioning of our products in each of our local markets. On the Medicare & Medicaid side, from our -- as you know, we're just starting into the AEP season. Again, we feel we have a very balanced offering in the marketplace, feel good about our Medicare positioning, and Medicare Advantage had a very strong Medicare Supplement business this year and we'd expect to continue to see strong performance there and feel we have a balanced offering in Part D as well. On Medicaid, we've continued to win procurements. And again, that is a market where we know that states are facing some significant budget challenges. We see opportunities. We're pleased with the win that we had in Ohio on the dual eligibles, as well as the state Medicaid and the procurements there, and continue to get very focused on affordability and providing I think strong offerings to our State partners, both across Medicaid and Medicare. So overall, from a growth perspective, getting back to your question, I think we feel well positioned, but recognize the competitive nature of the marketplace and are very respectful of that.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. So the kind of net answer here sounds like the business momentum feels just as strong going into 2013 as it was going in -- as it kind of has continued to be during 2012. And the commercial risk business is the area where you see pressure, and that's no different than what you're seeing this year in terms of the economy. Is that a fair way to look at it?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Well, I won't comment on '13 guidance, but I'll tell you that we do feel we're well positioned.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And you've only heard part of the story because Larry Renfro can speak to the Optum side.","Larry C. Renfro","I think everybody knows that we have a 3-year business plan that we're operating under. We call it Becoming One Optum. And if you look at that plan and you look at the execution that we've been achieving this year, there's really 4 areas that'll give you a little detail behind that. One being financial discipline\/cost management; two being reengineering\/organizational simplification; three being portfolio management; and four being growth. So I think in terms of your question, you were more geared towards the growth. So let me just give you a couple of comments. We do feel pretty well positioned. I think if you look this quarter, OptumHealth was up about 19%. OptumInsight up about 15%, with OptumInsight's backlog being up about 19%. But if you look at growth, where we see it coming from in the future as part of our plan, it'll be the PBM, it'll be care delivery, the retail\/consumer and provider. So we feel pretty good about the overall plan. We feel pretty good about the execution in 2012 and looking forward to some results in the future.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So overall, I'd say pretty positive.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The question is about cost trend, both around utilization as well as unit cost. So can you give me some color first around the reserve development, which is very favorable compared to some of your peers in recent quarters by segment, Medicare\/Medicaid, commercial and if utilization is equally weak and well-controlled in all segments? And then on the unit cost side, given that we've got now 40% of docs owned by hospitals, per the recent advisory board data, Sutter, Long Island Jewish, New York Montefiore and many others are beginning to apply for health plan licenses, are you seeing any pressure on your unit cost? And how do you see that evolving in the next 1 to 3 years?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Hi, Ana. This is Dan Schumacher. So let me take the pieces of that. First, with respect to the reserve development. I think it's important to share that our fundamental discipline has not changed. So we have a comprehensive reserve setting process. It's consistent. It's stable. And each month, each quarter, we are trying to sort out our best estimate of the ultimate claims expense. And as a result, we don't have an expectation of future favorable development. And as you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we'll get it in relation to prior year medical spend and so forth, it's about 1%, so in a relatively reasonable range. In terms of the things that are contributing to the development, I'd say first on the utilization side, as I mentioned, we saw a surge in utilization in the first quarter and some moderation in the second quarter forward. And that's true across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial. And that contributed to our development. We also continue to have improving processing speed, as well as processing quality. That's showing up in the form of reserve development. And then beyond that, our performance around our affordability agenda. So we take a prudent approach as we introduce programs. We wait to see that manifest in actual claims payment. And then that starts to impact our reserve results. And so you're seeing favorable development across kind of those 3 things. As you look at the composition of trend between cost and utilization, utilization is a little bit better than we expected, and I would likewise say that unit cost is a little bit better than expectation. On the commercial side specifically, it remains an area of intense pressure for us, and it represents more than 2\/3 of our trend outcome each year, so it is a very meaningful part of our trend equation. But I will tell you that on the unit cost side, we are doing a little bit better than we thought. We think that's in part due to the reconfiguration of our payment, aligning it with performance and quality and value.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So its default being you're turning more to shed savings risk-based contracting, if I may just close that off?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, we're working up the continuum, so starting in fee-for-service and then working towards shared savings and gain sharings, up through bundle in episode relatively sub-capitations and capitations and so forth, working to align the incentives across the continuum. And we rely heavily on our partners in Optum to help to provide those services and support tools for the delivery system to be able to meet us where we want a contract.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Steve, I wanted to clarify a comment that you made in the prepared remarks. You said that you would expect commercial risk business to be down moderately next year, and I wanted to understand better if that was referring to top line or margin because it sounded like you thought the intensity of pricing and competition was continuing and cost would be up next year. So looking at those 2 pieces together, where do we end up from a margin perspective?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure, I think Gail can respond to this.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. What Steve was referring to is that, as you know this year, we're down in enrollment over 25,000 lives on risk-based. And as Jeff said in his comments to the earlier question, we expect to continue to be a competitive environment, and we would expect enrollment to be down.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. So the comment was directed at enrollment, not at margins?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","It was at enrollment, yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to cost trend. I know you took it down a bit. Maybe can you talk about what you expect on the inpatient and outpatient side of what you're seeing in terms of trend there? And then you mentioned sort of the shift to inpatient outpatient. How much of that is really driving the lower cost, what you're doing to help that push? And if at all, if you can frame sort of the savings in aggregate on a like-for-like basis.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dan, you want to cover that again?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. So with respect to the categories, where we're seeing utilization up, we're seeing it up in the outpatient setting, and that is in part due to some of the management programs we have in place. So we focus on converting one day lengths of stay to a more efficient setting to observation status. So they flip from inpatient to outpatient, and that was what I was talking about with respect to our management programs. And then on the inpatient side, we are seeing continuously restrained utilization. Our bed days were actually flat to declining, and each of our benefits businesses and those things extend through from admissions, the length of stay, as well as focused on the readmission rates so that when you leave the hospital, you're able to stay home. And again, that's an example of a partnership with Optum, where their care management teams are working to transition people to the home setting and help them stay there. Those are some of the examples of the things that we're doing that are making a difference inside of our cost trends.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just -- again, on the 5.5%, I guess I'm just trying to get a sense. Does that equate to inpatient being up 4% and outpatient being up 9% or can you help in that regard? Just trying to get a sense of the magnitude when you talk about inpatient and outpatient, given that you lowered the trend?","Dan Schumacher","Well, so you when you're talking about the trend, you got to take into account unit cost and utilization. On the utilization side, specifically, inpatient is actually down, outpatient is up. On the unit cost side, most of our unit cost increases come in the inpatient setting. That's where our increases are coming from. So when you blend that all together, as I mentioned before, balanced against our Investor Conference guidance, better in inpatient, better in pharmacy, relatively stable in physician and higher in outpatient.","Operator","And we'll go next to Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","2012 is definitely a year of investment, not just around your Optum segment, but also in preparation for certain regulatory changes and reform implementation in 2014. Can you just help us think about any incremental investments you may still need to make as we head into 2013, and whether there's any sort of step function change, up or down, in your SG&A as we head into next year?","Stephen J. Hemsley","So let me see if I can understand the question. As we continue to prepare for adopting and embracing the healthcare reform changes and continue the activities in our business, such as in-sourcing our PBM, et cetera, I guess you're asking us where our cost -- you're looking for an increase in cost or something like that, is that...","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, sort of just how we think about your SG&A, especially around those types of investments as we move from '12 into '13.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think '12 has actually had a reasonable burden with respect to those kinds of investments, and I think that much of it will carry through into 2013, and probably subside more in the latter stages of it, but I think an area that's most impacted by those kinds of activities is Optum. So maybe I'll ask Larry or John Rex to kind of comment.","Larry C. Renfro","Sure. If you -- and I think that most people know that we have spent the last couple of years designing the PBM operational platform, as well as the infrastructure to move the UHC business onto our platforms. So 2012 ended up being the strong year for us to invest. That investment should start to wind down at the end of this year, and there'll be some lag into 2013, but we feel pretty good about where we're at with that. It's perfectly on plan. So that's pretty much it. John, I don't know if there's anything else.","Dirk McMahon","Yes, so what I would add to that, Larry, is that you're absolutely right, this is Dirk McMahon. In 2012, we had probably our highest SG&A burden associated with investments in the insourcing, but in 2013 we'll also have some expenses associated with training our people as we bring them into deal with the membership that we will ratably bring in throughout 2013.","Dan Schumacher","Larry, just to follow-on here, I think in the first half of the year, we made comments in the first 2 quarters about the investments we're making across the broader business in addition to OptumRx. We expect to continue to make those investments, and I think from what you're seeing in this quarter as we're starting to realize some of the benefits that we would expect to continue to make with investments that we work out into 2013 also.","Stephen J. Hemsley","But nothing -- but basically continuation, nothing...","Dan Schumacher","In continuation, that kind of levels it out...","Stephen J. Hemsley","And how about on the UnitedHealthcare side?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","It's Gail Boudreaux. In the UnitedHealthcare side, you'll continue to see there's some investments, stable investments in Reform, so you think about ongoing investments in ICD-10. In addition, we made investments this year in 2012 in helping to standup the TRICARE contract, and we will continue to make those as we prepare to serve that membership in March of 2013, and those investments will -- getting that contract ready to stand up will also flow into 2013.","Operator","And we'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You guys talked about Optum growing and margins continuing to improve, and then SG&A being perhaps higher in '12 than maybe in '13 or at least similar, but not growing, and talk about building the insurance fee into the commercial risk business. I'm trying to gauge why the pressure on EPS growth making earnings growth -- the consensus numbers challenging for 2013. It comes sort of down to the Medicare business and we look at that, and you clearly have some very good margin in the Medicare business or certainly lower medical loss ratio. Are you sort of expecting a much weaker margin in Medicare for next year sort of getting ready for the MLR minimums in 2014? Is that the way to think about this?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, no, maybe I could reset. I think if you go back to a commentary we have made really over the last couple of years, really it is -- we're responding to an environment that is broadly challenging, and where we have been successful navigating those challenges. Those challenges remain, and the economic environment remains, and the pressure on budgets remain. And the pressure on making sure that we execute flawlessly with respect to -- we just mentioned the TRICARE contract or the PBM in-sourcing, staying on the One Optum plan, those kinds of elements, which we have a lot of respect for the work that goes into executing across those and basically, we remind the market each quarter about those challenges, and we approach things perhaps more cautiously than the marketplace, and I think that's what we are suggesting. We are really not -- you are perhaps overanalyzing if you're trying to focus down on a single product line. We're actually pretty positive about the breadth of our business, very positive about our Medicare and Medicaid outlook and potential. Actually, very positive with respect to commercial. If you take a look at the commercial market broadly, it has been, at best, treading water, or if not, contracting from that perspective. So we're just reminding the marketplace of those challenges in light of very, very strong results. So that really is the goal here, not -- there is no lack of confidence with respect to our competitiveness in the marketplace, our ability to prosper under all the product lines we have right now.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just getting back to the minimum MLRs in Medicare, can you address that a little bit in terms of how well you think you are prepared? I know we don't even know how that's going to be calculated at this point, but in terms of your expectation for how that's going to work going forward, what kind of pressure do see on margins in the Medicare business in 2014, if not sooner?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Actually, we feel pretty good about that. Gail?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Yes, I think -- this is Gail Boudreaux again. I think you said at first, we don't have the exact calculation yet for how the minimum MLR will be applied in Medicare, but it is obviously one of those factors that as we get into 2013 and prepare our bids for 2014, we'll take that into consideration along with a number of other factors but to be more specific, would you expect to be able to manage within it.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And if I would add, one other element to the thinking is the '12 has had a lot of favorable elements to it, and as I said in the prepared remarks, you cannot necessarily assume that those will play into '13 as strongly as they did in '12. We will continue to operate in endeavor to achieve that, but that's an element of caution that we also give. So I wouldn't over read our caution. I would just think that we have to regularly remind ourselves and remind the marketplace of the issues.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to go back to the industry fee pricing commentary. So you guys are starting to price for the industry fee starting next year, but there's no actual fee until 2014. So shouldn't that be a tailwind to 2013 MLRs?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dan, review that again.","Dan Schumacher","You're right, Kevin, that will provide a little bit of help in 2013 as we collected our premiums, the cost of that tax in 2014 in the commercial space.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, good. Maybe I was misreading it, but it sounded to me like you were saying it gives you a feel there's some sort of headwind that had to be dealt with. It's actually just more on the commercial membership side that you're talking about? And if you believe that it is in some ways a headwind on the commercial membership, does that mean that some of your competitors, I guess, most of the non-profits because the for-profits have kind of indicated a similar pricing dynamic to use. Does it mean that some of the non-profits are not following that strategy?","Dan Schumacher","We really can't comment. We don't really know the strategies others are following. This is an element that is part of our rate development. The headwinds we talk about are a fact of the market coming to grips with this element of pricing as it goes into our rate development process. So really, that's what we are talking about. You're right about it being a tailwind in terms of that element, and we really aren't going to comment about how others are going to approach this. Any further things to add?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I just think, Kevin, that the pressure that we're talking about is really the increase in pressure on -- pressure on already strained employer, consumers, federal and state governments. It's really the pressure it adds to the system, as it adds another cost in the environment. And I think just in terms of how this is recovered in 2013, I do want to clarify that it is ratable. So if you're a February 1 effective date, we would be looking to recover the month of January in 2014. So 1\/12, 2\/12, 3\/12 and so forth.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, as the year goes on, that would increasingly be a benefit, but then as you roll into 2014, it's now a net mutual aspect. But I guess as you thought about that, I think it's accounted for that you expected margin compression in your business lines. Is that because the thing with development is not going to re-accrue into net even though you're going to have a pickup and a tailwind at 2013, the fact that you don't assume favorable development, they wash? Or how do we think about that?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, the only thing I'll leave there is that we do not assume development going forward. We believe our reserves are set appropriately, and so we don't really have a view of reserve development going forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to stick on the industry tax subject, and maybe if you can just talk about what some of the latest feedback that you're getting from CMS and from the states. Is -- if you're guiding anything in terms of how they're planning to build in the tax into the rates for Medicaid and for the Medicare products?","Dan Schumacher","So, Scott, good morning. With respect to Medicaid. Again, this will be an element of the cost structure that will go into our rate development. And this, along with all the other factors that go into rate development, will be part of our dialogue with our state partners over the course of 2013, as they start to set rates that flow into 2014. So I would say that conversation is on the horizon in earnest. And then on the Medicare side, it is going to be one of the factors that we consider in our -- developing our bid strategy and bid approach for 2014. So as you think about the first 6 months of next year, we'll be taking into consideration the health insurance tax, as well as all the other changes, and then trying to ultimately preserve the value of the benefits that seniors really enjoy.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Dan, is it fair to think about for Medicare that we won't actually be seeing when CMS gives us preliminary and final rates for '14, and there won't be an adjustment in the rate? It's more that the industry will need to adjust the benefits and the pricing to accommodate the tax?","Dan Schumacher","I won't comment on CMS rate setting. I think our expectation is that as we formulate our bid approach, we'll need to consider this as another element in that approach.","Stephen J. Hemsley","CMS will have to consider it as well in terms of how they survey the private sector market for Medicare. So these conversations are really just beginning. This is really, just will be getting introduced at this point in time across basically all the elements for rate development, whether it's commercial or whether it's in the government programs.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jason Gurda with Leerink Swann.","Jason Gurda - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","One of your peers recently commented on their expectations for margins in the small group and individual product in 2014 on the exchanges. Can you provide may be a little bit of commentary or perspective on what you're expecting or how you expect the margins or how you expect the changes to impact your margins and maybe your perspective on what your competitor had stated?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure, Gail, you want to touch on this?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Yes, well, why I don't Jeff and I give you a little perspective. I'm not going to make some comments on our competitors\u2019 perspective on the marketplace, but I think we want to put this a bit in context. The small-business market has always been a very competitive and a very transparent market. That's the market we've done very well in. We see it as a robust market, and quite frankly, the focus has always been about on affordable price point, strong consumer engagement, and making sure that you have a cost structure that underlies that strong positioning. So as we think about exchanges going forward, there's a wide range of expectations around the migration to exchanges, and we expect that to be measured as we head into 2014. Part of that is due just to the ability of getting these exchanges up and running. The second one is that employers, as they think about the tax advantage they currently have and then the need to have to make that up in compensation or other things, that's one of the reasons we do think it's going to be measured. But with that, we do expect that there will be pressure in margins over the long term, and again that goes back to underscoring the importance of having affordable plan design, strong network composition, making sure that your cost structure is aligned. But we do also see opportunities for growth, given that opportunity, given the positioning of ourselves in the small-business market, and maybe I'll ask Jeff to comment a little bit about that as well.","Jeff Alter","It's Jeff Alter. I agree with Gail's comments about the existing small group market. I'll also just remind that we have been involved in exchanges for quite a long time, certain states, certain industry associations. So some of the lessons learned there, I think are applicable as well for product design, choice around network construct. So there's still a lot to know about the exchanges. Things are being developed right now. We don't have all the rules. But I think as the exchanges become more firm, we will engage with the -- those constructs and apply some of the lessons that we've learned over the years in our small group business and in the participation and the number of exchanges to that marketplace. We don't -- we see it as just as another distribution in another marketplace, and we'll react to that marketplace like we have the deal with all the marketplace.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And the only thing I'd add is that there's really nothing new there. That basically reflects our thinking and our posture probably for the last 2 years or more. So there really isn't anything new. Those pressures have been there, and we expect them to remain.","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to the cost trend real quickly here. Relative to the initial trend guidance, is it fair to say that the new level is down entirely because the utilization, a component of trend is lower than relative to original expectations? And then I guess more importantly going forward, is -- even at when you started this year at up about 1.25% or so, is that sort of the new normal that we should think about is the right level prospectively? Or would you guys assume that, that eventually does reaccelerate?","Dan Schumacher","Chris, this is Dan. On the cost trends, the improvement in our guidance, that 50 basis point improvement at the mid-point, that is a blend of improvement both in utilization and a little bit better unit cost. So both are making a contribution to our 2012 cost trend view. As we think about our cost trend into 2013 in the commercial business, we expect the trend to be relatively stable.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple quick questions. Are you assuming in kind of your cautious outlook the potential for the fiscal cliff and other situations not to be resolved favorably enough to have potentially a similar situation to what we saw in '08 with medical trends? And can you highlight your low-income PDP bidding strategy in terms of kind of what you were thinking there?","Stephen J. Hemsley","So to -- I'll have Dirk kind of talk to or the -- who wants to do the Part D, okay? And then are the elements of our fiscal cliff and so forth specific? No, I think they're part of the landscape and what we talk about when we talk about the pressures that are on government and so forth. I don't know how one would actually feather in that in a specific way, but it is clearly a factor in our caution list as we think about 2013. So clearly, we recognize it. Clearly, we're focusing on its impact in terms of potential impact on government programs and so forth, but nothing that we can actually specifically do, but a good reason why we stay more cautious than perhaps the marketplace. And with respect to Part D?","Jack Larsen","Jack Larsen. So on the Part D saver plan, I guess as market leader we had a point of view that we need to be serving the broader market. So we set out really to design a plan that appeal to those consumers who are really more, I guess economy minded, more sensitive to the fixed premium rather than some of the other planned features when you compare that to the third plan that we offer today which is, in comparison, relatively more comprehensive. I guess having designed that product for that consumer segment, I guess we're just happy that the plan actually have stayed below the benchmark status, and we get a chance to serve low-income population for calendar 2013.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And your assumption is that the medical trend's stable in 2013, if I hear you correctly, versus '12 not the upticks in commercial?","John S. Penshorn","It's John Penshorn. I think Dan was referring to a stable rate of increase as opposed to 0% year-over-year.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Anything further?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","No, the only thing I'd add, Christine, to Jack's comments around Part D is part of the -- I think the value is looking at the marketplace, as he said in assessing it, and then also our partnership with OptumRx, our ability to manage formulary effectively, our retail network, as well as our overall program. We think that adds unique value to us in our ability to play in that marketplace and broadly serve both the low-income, as well as the retail market.","Operator","We will go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","First of all, it is a very hard work to do everything that has been accomplished at United and everyone there should be congratulated on the execution in a challenging environment and I want to thank you, Steve, for the appropriateness of the reminder of how challenging it is, and also for the fact that the tone is more cautious, not nearly assessing the stake as it was last year, and so the stock is not having heart failure. But my question is this, we've talked a lot on this call about what happens as reform is implemented? But there is a nontrivial risk at this point that we could have the 3 Rs on the hill and then the White House. And if we've got Romney, Ryan and we've got republicans running the senate, or at least, a split senate, so 51 going to republican and the republican house. Is it possible that reform may change materially, if not go away completely in some way, shape or form. So my question to you is what happens to United in the event that reform doesn't happen? How are you positioned to succeed?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, Sheryl, regardless of what legislation went in place, some of the underlying elements in the marketplace that led to policy initiatives around making the health care system more effective and efficient, modernizing that system, expanding and addressing areas where coverage was not sufficient, access needed to be better channeled, needed to be established, making -- being able to deliver more consistent quality, getting at the underlying cost. All of those elements contributed to kind of this national conversation around health care, and the results are a first policy initiative, which was largely around the expansion of coverage. And I think everybody recognizes there will continue to be work to be done to improve the health care system both from a policy point of view and from an operational point of view. That's what we do. That's really where kind of the mission of this enterprise is. So regardless of what comes forward in terms of policy and what generations follow it, we will respond and operate and work within the system to maximize the potential of this enterprise as commercial enterprise, and to maximize our impact on the health care system in total. So if there is a change in direction with respect to health care, we will maneuver and evolve and adapt to that change. We've talked about our adaptability for years. We don't think the underlying issue has changed. Fact of the matter is, coverage needs to be better considered. Costs need to be addressed more effectively. The system needs to operate more efficiently. Resources need to be accessed in a fair way and gone further, and the consistency of the processes and so forth need to advance. All those elements are things that basically work to our competencies and the strength of our businesses. So we will just adapt, if you will, to those kinds of changes. And I think as an organizational capability, we have very, very strong adaptability skills. So that would be the response. We really -- we'll never comment in terms of the political persuasion one way or another. We will respond with what the market -- how the market begins to evolve, and we'll adapt to serve it.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And just to follow-up. So in terms of the contingency plan, is it fair to say the entire company strategy is the contingency plan?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think the whole nature of this organization has been to adapt to that and to adapt to it, the market challenges. So the whole construct, modular development of the business built around competencies, the fact that we deploy and redeploy kind of almost on a nonstop basis is really how we approach serving the marketplace. And if there are changes, we obviously have thought through the kind of changes that could occur. We think we can respond to them very effectively.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So, Steve, as I think about adjusting my outlook, our outlook relative to the cautionary comments that you've made on the call, I'm interested in kind of thinking about whether that is pulling back a little bit on Optum and UnitedHealthcare, or if it's more heavily weighted toward one side or the other. And thinking about Optum, you've got the UHC business coming in, preparatory costs winding off, margins in all 3 segments there seem to be progressing pretty nicely, and so it would certainly seem to point toward lower expectations on the UHC side of the business. I think most of your comments point toward that on the call. I just want to make sure I confirm and understand that being the case and in particular, that it would be in the commercial risk business that you would point to as being the -- maybe the area of greatest weakness, for a lack of a better word.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Actually, our goal is really not to provide that kind of specific guidance for you today. Really, it is really more of messaging that we take perhaps a more respectful and cautious view of the market in total. We also recognize 2012 has been a strong year and has benefited from a number of positive things which we hope we'll continue, but we can't be sure of. We're certainly confident in our Optum business, but we're also very confident in our United health care business and businesses. The commentary around the commercial marketplace is almost identical to last year. I mean, we were saying the same things last year about moderation in terms of growth in the commercial risk segment, and we're saying it again this year. We are down about 200,000 in commercial risk, and we consider that to be a moderate level. So we are not trying to signal alarm in any particular area. We are really just suggesting that 2012 has been a very strong year. We expect 2013 to grow in both revenue and earnings. But as we sit in October of 2012 and assess the challenges ahead, we hope to continue the strength of this performance. We're actually in a good or better position than we were at this time last year, but we think we are being cautious and we think the market should be cautious as well, and that's all I can offer you until we discuss this at the Investor Conference in more detail, which is just a little bit more than a month.","So as we wind it up, I think UnitedHealth Group continues to deliver a solid performance in the third quarter. We remain cautious about the challenges ahead, and we certainly have discussed that well. Perhaps most critical, though, in terms of the challenges we're continuing to work to really improve the quality of the health care system to control the rising cost of care, and to really work to serve the people that we serve across the enterprise. So as we said today, we're very optimistic that we have the people of this company. We'll rise to the challenges across-the-board, and we look forward to seeing you at the Investor Conference in just a little over a month. So thank you very much for joining us this morning.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 15, 2020, which maybe accessed from the Investors page of the company\u2019s website.","I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann. Please go ahead.","David Wichmann","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Six weeks ago, we had the privilege of spending the day with many of you at our annual investor conference providing an in-depth look at the accelerating opportunities we see to serve more people, more deeply and to grow strongly into 2020 and well beyond. As we conclude 2019 and step into the New Year, the performance of our business strengthens our confidence in the themes, opportunities and outlooks of that day, as evidenced by today\u2019s results. We remain highly focused on driving affordability, innovating with consumer and customer responsive products and services, improving operating performance and advancing NPS.","Full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share were stronger than our investor conference outlook growing 17% for the year to $15.11 per share. Full year revenues exceeded $242 billion growing $16 billion over 2018 with notable gains in our Medicare, care delivery and pharmacy care services businesses. Full year cash flows were $18.5 billion or 1.3x net income. We finished the year encouraged by continued performance improvement in Medicaid. Early market interest in our new innovative line of employer sponsored benefit offerings and 2020 individual Medicare Advantage annual enrollment results, which were our strongest ever. Within our Medicare Advantage offerings including dual eligible growth, we expect to serve nearly 700,000 more people in 2020, the upper end of the range of performance offered at our investor conference.","Our fourth quarter medical and operating cost positions continued to improve meaningfully enterprise-wide with ample opportunity for further progress on both of these fronts and our NPS improved nicely in 2019 across our businesses, particularly within network care providers, enrollees in Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans as well as patients served by our OptumCare and pharmacy care services businesses. Improved costs and higher satisfaction propelled by meaningful innovation allow us to contribute more comprehensively to the development and deployment of the kind of next generation health system needed in the U.S. and globally, a more forward-looking modern health system built around the people we serve seamlessly woven into their lives, simple, convenient, transparent and compassionate, a health system that is more affordable creates the better experience for both patients and physicians and improves health outcomes.","The health system we are helping to build will better meet the personalized needs of people. It leverages the next generation data analytics such as the individual health record to empower patients and their doctors with actionable intelligence that drives next best actions to improve decision-making in real time. We are committed to a future where every person has access to high-quality affordable healthcare that meets their unique healthcare needs and financial means. We are employing specific actions to help achieve this driving better health outcomes and aiming ultimately to reduce the healthcare cost trends to general inflation levels even with an aging, more chronically ill population. Notably, the bipartisan repeal of the ACA taxes in December was the strongest step towards improving affordability for Americans. It will greatly assist those who have been most affected by the cost of those taxes, especially seniors, small employers and those who are individually insured. As we continue to do better for those we serve, we will grow helping improve the health system, one person at a time intensely focused on driving improved consumer and physician experiences. Looking to the years ahead, our strengthening capabilities and diversified complementary businesses operating in the large growing healthcare market positioned us well to achieve our long-term adjusted earnings per share growth rate objective of 13% to 16%, while we continue as always to invest in the future for sustainable, market-leading performance and advancing shareholder returns.","With that, let me turn it to UnitedHealth Group President and Optum Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Witty to discuss Optum\u2019s results and momentum heading into the New Year.","Andrew Witty","Thank you, Dave. At Optum, we are encouraged and humbled by the expanding opportunities to grow and serve more people more deeply. There is a distinct energy and eagerness across our businesses as we enter 2020.","In 2019, Optum revenues reached $113 billion growing 12% year-over-year. Total operating earnings grew 14% to $9.4 billion. OptumHealth revenues reached $30.3 billion in 2019, up 26% led by OptumCare, our care delivery business. We are steadily expanding into new geographies and expanding the depth and breadth of services in existing regions to further provide patients with the highest quality, convenient and affordable health services. One measure that helps illustrate how we are serving people more comprehensively is revenue per consumer served, which grew 26% in the quarter. This measure will continue strongly advancing as we further build out our integrated care delivery network.","Turning to OptumRx, revenues of $74.3 billion grew 7% even with the previously discussed impact of the single large customer transition. The 2020 selling season for core pharmacy benefit services has now mostly concluded and it was our strongest ever. Through our other pharmacy care and specialty drug businesses, given our current positions we see significant opportunity to more fully serve patients\u2019 pharmacy needs in their communities and drive better adherence and clinical outcome. At OptumInsight, revenues of $10 billion grew 11% and the revenue backlog was up 14% to $19.3 billion. OptumInsight perhaps more than any of our other businesses has a dual role; it has both unmatched capability to help distinguish our other businesses and serves as a profitable, growing externally facing business on its own.","I would like to spend a few extra minutes this morning on how we view OptumInsight and why we are encouraged by its potential. I will start with the foundations. First, deep data and advanced analytics are at the core supporting modern technologies and platforms to make the health system more interoperable, transparent and efficient. Second, research, consulting and large scale managed services enabled by data analytics and digital and operational innovations made the consumer experience simpler, smarter and more compassionate. And third, clinical expertise, combined with rich data and analytics drive measurably better patient care and outcomes, reduce its friction while lowering the total cost of care.","We are connecting the health system to deliver better outcomes, low cost and an improved experience for patients and their clinicians. This includes developing the connected infrastructure that integrates clinical systems, revenue management platforms and administrative claims transactions to enable critical bi-drectional data exchange. Our solutions are harmonizing and organizing billions of transactions while applying considerable intelligence through our advanced technologies, clinical ontologies and data analytics capabilities. We want to ensure critical decision support information gets to the right people at the right time with rigorous protocols to protect patient privacy all while offering full transparency of health system performance on both quality and cost.","Our Optum 360 business helps health systems and hospitals improve revenue performance and patient experience. We deploy natural language processing for computer-assisted coding and documentation and provide data interchange and information exchange solutions as well as patient access services. Optum 360 now manages about $70 billion in annual billings for unaffiliated customers. More than 5 billion pages of clinical documents are processed annually by our natural language processing engines. These are used in a variety of other applications and customer data to help inform clinical actions and create administrative efficiencies from the more than 80% of the clinical record that is essentially free text, such as physician notes and discharge summaries.","Payment Integrity is among OptumInsight\u2019s strongest growing businesses. It provides compliance and cost containment solutions both prior to and following the payment of the claim. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services for data mining and predictive modeling to help over 250 national, state and local health plans and others ensure appropriate payments for services saving billions annually. Within the OptumInsight technology businesses, we apply advanced analytics and deep learning models to healthcare data covering nearly 240 million people to help optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the cost of care. Key offerings include population health, risk analytics and technology support and our research and consulting businesses provide thought leadership and expertise that reaches more than 200,000 leaders across the sector. Importantly, this business gives us at the forefront of how health systems and providers are thinking about and approaching the future and drive deeper, more integrated customer relationships across the broader Optum businesses.","As we turn into the new decade, we stand our potentially transformative moment, where the application of leading 21st century technologies and machine powered analytical protocols will open up for the first time the opportunity to create ever more precise predictions of individual and system health status and risk. This will accelerate a much more focused set of interventions to improve outcomes. I have no doubt this will be an increasingly critical element of our Optum wide goal of improving clinical outcomes, quality and affordability ","Now, I will turn the call over to Dirk McMahon, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.","Dirk McMahon","Thank you, Andrew. UnitedHealthcare is deeply embedded in every aspect of the health system from how to finance and pay for healthcare to engaging people and aligning incentives to promote healthier behaviors and better medicine to improve overall health at lower cost. UnitedHealthcare revenues grew by more than $10 billion to $194 billion in 2019. Operating earnings increased by 13% or $1.2 billion to $10.3 billion led by the strength in our Medicare and dual special needs businesses. As Dave noted, we are off to a strong start in Medicare Advantage this year.","I would like to quickly share how we are helping to build the better health system: first, improving affordability; second, engaging and serving people; third, advancing product innovation; and fourth, serving through hands-on data-driven clinical care. Let\u2019s start with affordability because that is the gating factor for greater access to care and improving the consumer experience. One of our goals is to engage more deeply with the highest performing physicians and other clinicians to advance both quality and affordability. We know these high-performing providers achieve considerably better health outcomes, while lowering the total cost of care. Our medical cost trend over the last 5 years has strongly outperformed financial average. We are committed to driving significantly lower rates in healthcare spending growth than the industry. We see billions of additional dollars in potential savings for consumers and customers from areas such as out site of service initiatives and more deeply embedding digital tools to reduce the administrative burden for physicians.","We are also using digital and physical strategies to engage consumers in new ways to simplify their experience, reduce their financial burden, and lower the total cost of care. For example, for the nearly 1.5 million people enrolled in our motion program, we offer incentives for increased individual mobility. People can earn more than $1,000 a year when they achieve defined walking frequency and intensity targets. People enrolled in motion are achieving better health at a meaningfully lower cost that is why we are expanding this program and extending product designs that rewards stronger consumer engagement and align incentives with their doctor.","The third area is product innovation. We are seeing early signs of customer interest in our innovative new offerings in consumer centric products that better aligns to the unique needs and financial means of people, while engaging them in managing their health. Some examples are Harmony, a new collaboration with OptumCare providers, unites high-quality care and coverage, creating a more integrative and effective consumer experience with as much as 20% savings for our fully insured customers; All Savers offers small employers with highly flexible, affordable health plans and reduces employee out-of-pocket cost with low or no preventative and primary care coverage; NexusACO enables large employers to offer a single ACO based plan nationwide incentivizing employees to choose high-performing providers and driving better outcomes through care coordination; Bind, provides first dollar coverage and allows people to add coverage on demand for plant procedures offered by high value providers following rigorous care pathways based on best known science, while costing approximately 15% less than comparable plans. And finally, our virtual first product is attracted to the digital first generation. This new product offers zero dollar co-pay, 24\/7 virtual care support at a lower price than traditional products. These are some examples of our innovation focus and health benefits and you should expect more as we redouble our efforts to engage consumers in more impactful ways and accelerate our growth in this category.","Lastly, we are deploying relevant information at the point of care to improve the way care is received and managed. Point of Care Assist is a tool that puts real-time patient information at the fingertips of doctors in their EMRs providing a seamless clinical workflow experience. This improves adherence to clinical protocols, facilitates real-time authorization approvals and helps refer the patient to premium designated specialists. The utility of this tool is significant for all as doctors save time and money, consumers avoid cost surprises, and most importantly, health outcomes are improved. As we look to 2020 and beyond, there was a $900 billion untapped managed care market opportunity in health benefits, much of it in government programs where we have grown strongly and we look to serve more people more deeply across the system.","Now, I will turn it over to John Rex, CFO of UnitedHealth Group.","John Rex","Thank you, Dirk. This morning, we reported full year revenues of $242 billion, up $15.9 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by double-digit revenue growth in Medicare and across Optum. Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of $3.90 per share grew 19% and brought full year earnings to $15.11, growth of 17%. Cash flows from operations of $18.5 billion grew 18% over 2018 to 1.3x net income better than anticipated partly due to timing factors.","Our balance sheet return metrics remained strong with return on equity of almost 26%. We ended the year with a debt to capital ratio of around 40%, even with over $10 billion of deployment for business combinations and CapEx, $5.5 billion in share repurchases and a 20% dividend increase. Medical reserves developed favorably in the fourth quarter by $270 million, including a $150 million from 2019. Overall, medical costs were well managed, resulting in an 82.5% medical care ratio for full year 2019. We continue to be highly attentive to operating costs as part of our overall affordability agenda. In 2019, our operating cost ratio of 14.5% improved 50 basis points, reflecting 60 basis points of operating cost productivity and the deferral of the health insurance tax partially offset by the effect of business mix changes and continued investments in innovation, service and growth.","We enter 2020 with diversified growth momentum, balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. On earnings progression, we continue to expect 47% to 48% of full year earnings per share to be realized in the first half of the year, a point to keep in mind on that quarterly progression. 2019\u2019s first quarter has one fewer work day than 2018\u2019s resulting in a higher earnings level. This year, the first quarter had a more normal mix, but then adds an extra day due to leap year. Taken together, the day count shifting has a year-over-year impact on the medical care ratio of about 80 basis points. This will result in the first quarter 2020 MCR running higher than the second quarter and earnings per share progressing accordingly, with just under 55% of the first half earnings expected to be realized in the second quarter. These impacts of course were fully contemplated in that 2020 outlook we have provided at the beginning of December. For full year 2020, we continue to expect revenues to approach $262 billion and adjusted net earnings per share in a range of $16.25 to $16.55. Consistent with our prior practices, we will more formally address these and other expectations after the first quarter.","With that, I will turn it back to Dave.","David Wichmann","Thank you, John. As you can tell, we are confident in the outlook for our diversified and growing enterprise for 2020 and beyond. Our businesses remained strong and well-positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering even higher levels of suicidal value. We remain committed to our mission and an intense focus on serving one person at a time at increasing levels of value, more affordable, better outcomes and improved experiences while generating strong returns for you, our shareholders. Operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions, one, per caller please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the quarter in terms of medical cost, it looks like it came in better than you expected versus the update at the Investor Day. Any color there specifically if you can expand on how you are seeing kind of Medicaid progress from a cost and risk pool rate perspective as you kind of come into 2020 that will be really helpful as well? Thanks.","David Wichmann","John Rex?","John Rex","Hey, Justin. Good morning. Yes, I think I would point out a few things here. You are correct, it did come in just a little bit better than our guidance at the investor conference and a few things to note, first, I\u2019d call it broadly across the businesses as we continue to see the impact of the affordability initiatives that we have been very focused having traction and having impacts. So broadly across that, I think it\u2019s fair to say also that we certainly did see some continued improved in our Medicaid businesses, that\u2019s a place that we have been focused on for a while here and that was also a contributor. But broadly, I would say, across our businesses as we saw those affordability initiatives having traction.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Justin. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Yes, just it sounds like on the call today you are reaffirming your expectations around Medicare Advantage enrollment, obviously CMS has come out with their January numbers. It looks like in terms of the percentage enrolled in January, you are a little bit lighter than you were a year ago, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a fair comparison, but I wondered is there anything in the data that I don\u2019t know if you look at what they put out that is missing from your perspective? I know it shows you down in group MA and maybe you are going to pickup in group MA, but just you flush out a little further what group MA over the course of the year would anything to reassure us about your expectations around MA for this year?","David Wichmann","Thanks, A.J. We are very pleased with our AEP results. And I would say that by far it\u2019s our strongest year ever in individual Medicare. We did reaffirm the guidance, but nearer to the upper end of that guidance today, so we feel pretty strongly on with respect to our overall performance. Tim Noel, can you add some color on some of the other questions?","Tim Noel","Yes, good morning A.J. Thanks for the question. And first off, some of that CMS partial AEP reporting can be a little bit misleading. And Dave said, first and foremost, we want to reiterate the confidence in our full year enrollment growth that we shared at investor conference for MA. And just to revisit that briefly, we said 500,000 to 550,000 Medicare Advantage growth in the M&R business, which includes both group and individual MA and we also said that would be up to 700,000 in MA growth, including duals lifting our community and state business. So when AEP completes, we will have grown by 370,000 in individual MA, including the duals that are in CNS and that\u2019s up 140% over last year\u2019s AEP and is our strongest performance ever in the annual enrollment period. We expect this to drive full year results about 700,000 member growth in individual MA and that\u2019s split on January net growth versus the rest of the year is roughly 50-50 and that\u2019s consistent with the historical pacing and also full year supported by the momentum that we have seen in AEP. With respect to group, you are right, group MA contracted modestly in the CMS reporting. When January all settles out, we expect that to be down about 65, but that will strengthen to flat to down 25 as the year closes out. And finally, all told, really great start to the year, strong signal of confidence for the full year and our growth guidance shared at investor conference.","David Wichmann","Thank you, A.J. Next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. I think just sticking on the membership updates for 2020 and obviously you just gave some good detail on Medicare. Just interested if there is anything to call out in terms of on either the commercial business or the Medicaid business in terms of expectations on membership relative to the ranges that you had provided at Investor Day? Then also just specifically within that, just interested in how you are sort of approaching the North Carolina Medicaid situation, just given the budget situation there in terms of what you are assuming for for timing implementation of that and how manly lives you have factored in around North Carolina? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Good question, Scott. Thank you. Dirk McMahon will start and then Heather Cianfrocco can discuss Medicaid.","Dirk McMahon","Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question, Scott. So, we will be down a little bit in enrollment for 01\/01\/20 in both the fully insured and ASO areas. But as throughout the course of the year, we expect to gain membership in both areas that we have previously guided in December. As we look at 2020 we are going to continue with the pricing discipline that I have previously talked about as we balance enrollment growth with our margin expectations. We remain focused on delivering a unique value proposition for our customers and the consumer. Just to tell you, we are optimistic for next year, I mean in fully insured, expect strength in individual products in their middle-market, as I look at your ASO block, I look at our All Savers and I look at our middle-market as well. And with that, turn over to Heather on Medicaid.","Heather Cianfrocco","Thanks. Yes, so good question with respect to \u2013 I will start with membership and I will talk a little bit about North Carolina. So membership for this year we do expect growth in Medicaid this year and that\u2019s coming from a couple of places, North Carolina is in our 2020 guidance right now. We have got some other things in there. We have got some increases from some markets like our Washington win last year, Texas win, recent Texas wins. We are going to see some Nebraska expansion and then we see another strong year [indiscernible] as Tim just talked about for 2020 we think we are really well positioned there with new county expansion, service area expansion and our AEP is off to a really, really strong start. We are really excited about that. Pressure is obviously North Carolina. So, it\u2019s in our 2020 membership outlook and our revenue outlook and we assume it right now to come in about midyear. We are really honored we were selected. We are ready for implementation and we are eager to start serving North Carolinians. Despite the situation there, there is strong support for the program and for managed care there. So we are continuing to monitor the implementation date. We will keep you posted on that and you will watch that as well. In the meantime, we have got \u2013 we are excited about the opportunity, it\u2019s in our outlook and we look forward to hopefully getting that on track here close to midyear as possible.","David Wichmann","And just to add on to that a little bit, Scott, we won also in Kentucky, we are pleased to win obviously, that\u2019s being re-bid now, but we will hopefully prevail in the end there as well and it\u2019s a strong RFP season for Medicaid broadly. And I see the business having come around to being positioned with its turnaround just in time to compete ferociously for that business. So we are pretty bullish about the opportunity that exists in Medicaid and I think we are well positioned to grow. Thanks for the question, Scott. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. I\u2019d like to take it up a little bit in terms of looking at some of the longer term picture for Medicare, just couple of changes in the Medicare program and I am curious what you think of as being the biggest risks to you in terms of your business and those are paying for social determinants of health, which is something new for this year allowing ESRD patients to join next year and Medicare fee-for-service direct contracting by providers is starting. Can you talk about those three items and if they are risks to you?","David Wichmann","Sure. I would be happy to discuss all three of those. Tim?","Tim Noel","Yes. Yes, thanks Peter. So I think I will take ESRD first, but also I want to caution the long-term outlook especially with respect to 2021 and really any year, it\u2019s a little bit premature to get into some of the nuts and bolts of how we see the landscape shaping out. But on ESRD, we are very supportive of the change that goes into a fact that on 2021 and encouraged by the opportunity to serve more people. We are not concerned with some of the unknown elements around the reimbursement and payment idles. We will learn those details very soon. We remain confident and expecting that those models will be fair, adequate. And importantly, we believe that these people will be better served in Medicare Advantage. And also important to keep in mind, we served 40,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees with ESRD today that developed a disease post enrollment. And our focus of these members is both on prevention and also on treatment. So we are pleased to have the opportunity to expand our reach and impact with patients that have the disease at the time of enrollment. With respect to social determinants, we continue to have that be a key focus of our business consistently referring folks into insider programs where appropriate and some of the additional flexibility our apply social determinants and plan design are elements that we are leveraging in some of our demonstration projects in 2020. We are excited to learn a little bit more about this as the year progresses and look for more opportunities to do things in this area in 2021.","David Wichmann","The last one was physician direct contracting fee-for-service Medicare.","Brian Thompson","Right. Hey, Peter. Brian Thompson here. We are very encouraged by that as well. I think similar to what we have done with the bundled payment program it\u2019s a good opportunity to work on advancing traditional Medicare and we are encouraged by that thinking and creativity and look forward to participating.","David Wichmann","And I might add overall, Peter, that we are bullish obviously overall on the outlook for both Medicare Advantage, but also the dual special needs marketplace as well. They are both very larger today and growing in markets. MA is clearly outperforming fee-for-service in terms of overall benefit coverages and the quality of outcomes and the returns that people are getting in terms of their overall satisfaction. And so no surprise that it is performing as well and seems to be gaining some momentum. So we look forward to continuing to compete hopefully growing at these levels, if not higher going forward. Next question please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. Good morning. Question around the sort of broad space that\u2019s growing around physician enablement and I am curious it seems like there has been a lot of interest, a lot of new competitors that are kind of focused on that. I know Optum has been very early. Do you think of Optum as sort of the market leader and is this broad movement of physicians taking more risk, is this positive for UnitedHealth Group?","Andrew Witty","Josh thanks so much for the question. It\u2019s Andrew. Yes, we absolutely see physicians very much as a central element of improving care delivery quality and cost. It was really driving OptumCare which is clearly the central part of OptumHealth. As we see physicians move toward taking more risk, we see improvements across the board in terms of resource allocation, prevention, focus, ensuring clinical outcome is maximized. We are very encouraged by that trend. This year alone we would expect about 150,000 more patients to go into our physician risk managed programs across OptumCare. We continue to see that trend accelerate. It\u2019s very much something that we then anchored the build out of the rest of our OptumHealth portfolio around. So in a sense, is that thoughtfulness around how can we then create services inside data analytics which held the position, made the best possible judgment to manage the overall risk profile of the patient. You see that then reflected in the relentless growth of the revenue per patient served across OptumHealth. That\u2019s really being driven by this shift. And so you are absolutely right, very important element for us and it essentially becomes the core around which we then envision and build our support services, our interventions and our analytics to empower the physicians to make the best possible decision on behalf of the patients. Thank you.","David Wichmann","I might just add to that just slightly, Josh, that UnitedHealthcare is working on physician enablement as well. This is what the core of Dirk\u2019s commentary this morning was around Point of Care Assist. This is why we built and deployed the IHR and this is why we focus essentially in our investor conference around the way in which we engage both the digital and physical realms to AI enabled people to be able to operate much more effectively and serve their patients. So thanks for the question.","Operator","We will go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Thanks. Just want to go back to Medicaid for a minute. Can you talk a little bit about, I think you mentioned that in Q4, maybe you saw some improvement on Medicaid, but can you talk about the expectation for the year, I guess in particular, I guess two things, one is the implication of redeterminations and the rate updates will get relative to that, how are the rate updates going and do you \u2013 are you modeling additional rate determinations as the year goes on? And then second just quickly going back to the North Carolina, if North Carolina got delayed into 2021, would that impact your EPS guidance or is it more towards the revenue number at this point?","David Wichmann","Heather, do you want to take that question?","Heather Cianfrocco","Sure. So maybe I will start with that Medicaid performance. So, yes, we are pleased with Q4 results and when I said that I really mean it\u2019s marching along right within expectations with what we have really executed on our affordability agenda. We see strong partnership with our state to address what was for a period of time due to redeterminations or other under-funding issues, acquity-related under-funding. So as we look into 2020, I feel good about the progress made through all of \u201819 and particularly in the second half of \u201819 with respect to rates and with respect to affordability. And so as we come into 2020, we have got to view into our Q1 rate renewals. They are right in line with our expectations. They are up above what they were at the same time in \u201819. We have delivered on our clinical programs. We are seeing strong NPS, customer service scores and quality. So I feel good about that. As I say that, you still expect us to hit our target margin by the end of the year. So that just gives us renewed confidence in what was committed to you already, so expect our Medicaid business to continue to perform along that track and we will be hard at work on it. With respect to North Carolina, yes, I guess, I will just say, again we are monitoring it everyday right now, I am going to say that we are continuing to push and it is a big component of our opportunity in 2020 from revenue and a membership perspective. But that being said, there is a lot of other growth opportunities that we are measuring to. We didn\u2019t have Kentucky in our guidance, but we also didn\u2019t not got pushed, but we also didn\u2019t have the Massachusetts care bid that we just won. So we are going to be monitoring all those things. And right now, we are going to kind of work for midyear or close thereto implementation and we will keep you posted.","David Wichmann","Kevin, Dave again, if I can just add, so if North Carolina were to get pushed to 2021, it would not affect our expectations for the year, our guidance would stay the same. It is \u2013 as it comes out of the shoot it\u2019s a relatively modest margin product, market as is often the case. So we wouldn\u2019t expect any material impact on our expectations of the year. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes. Could you talk a little bit about PBM margin for the quarter and interested in, I mean, the improvement there, how much of that is driven by just to make sure from the transition of the large clients and how much is other initiatives like cross sales or sourcing initiatives?","David Wichmann","John Prince?","John Prince","Lance thanks for the question. As you look at the fourth quarter, the margin was elevated as expected. So when we gave our guidance at Investor Day, we are expecting a operating earnings margin around 6.3%, 6.4%. So, it\u2019s exactly what we expected. Why it was elevated is exactly what you mentioned was the loss of the large client, where we lost the revenue, but we didn\u2019t really impact our operating earnings. The second driver was the supply chain strength in terms of our \u2013 continue to negotiate with pharma manufacturers as well as the supply chain to get value to pass on to our clients. And so that was the other key driver for us. As you look to 2020 guidance, you should expect our operating earnings margin to fallback to where we have guided at Investor Day with 5.1% to 5.2%, so that should be your expectation. It was more of an anomaly what happened in Q4 as expected.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Lance. Next question please.","Operator","Yes. We will go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi, good morning. So, you reiterated guidance this morning for 2020, just want to clarify if the guidance already includes any impact from HIT repeal on midyear renewals and also the benefit from the Diplomat acquisition? And then another follow-up on the dual growth, I mean, obviously 15% to 20% is what is the implied growth which is strong and above market, but when we think about that, can you just kind of like help us think through the Part D dynamics and how that would slow through the P&L if it\u2019s going to to have any impact on OptumRx throughout the year?","David Wichmann","We will have John Rex started and then shift to Tim Wicks or John Prince.","John Rex","Hey, Ricky. John Rex here. So in terms of those elements you mentioned, I\u2019d say both immaterial in the scope of our company. You are correct, yes, when we guided to 2020 initially, the repeal of the HIT was the health insurance tax had not yet occurred, but I would call that immaterial to us, yes, there is some impact, but not material in terms of modest headwinds in the scheme of our company, not something that we would call out. Also in terms of the Diplomat, the pending Diplomat acquisition also, I would call that immaterial really no impact, really neutral in terms of our 2020 outlook.","David Wichmann","And John Prince?","John Prince","Thanks, Ricky. John Prince. In terms of the other pieces on Part D and other components, that\u2019s as expected. So I think we are not changing our guidance for 2020. What we expected in terms of Part D and Diplomat was built into our guidance and so we are comfortable with our expectations.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Ricky. Next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tanal","Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I guess at this stage I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the HIT repeal how we should be starting to thinking about modeling that in whether you commit to sort of at least the non-tax deductibility of it going away kind of falling to the bottom line or is it still too early? And then maybe just to your comment on OptumHealth just given the risk-taking nature of what you guys are doing, I thought it would be interesting to hear from you all how the flu impacted the economics of that business in Q4 thinking sort of revenue earnings margin? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Great. I will touch on the HIT and then Wyatt Decker will comment on OptumHealth. So overall, the HIT, we are as I said in the prepared remarks, we are pleased that this would go away. Obviously, it\u2019s great for seniors, families of small businesses and individual insurers as well on average for couple \u2013 senior couples $500 to $600 pretty much carries out the same for a family of four that\u2019s sponsored by a small business. And so obviously, this has strong economic impact on these families and individuals. So it\u2019s terrific to see it gets repealed. The other thing about it is it removes the excessive volatility. I am you are as fatigued with it as we are, it\u2019s in, it\u2019s out, and but more important in all of that is that, it affects the volatility of pricing in the marketplace as well. So hopefully we will see that stabilize as we get through 2020 and into 2021 as well. Just before I go to discuss 2021 and what our strategies maybe with respect to how we handle this, obviously, it\u2019s important that the tax value gets back into the hands of people. That\u2019s what it was intended to do and that\u2019s what we intend to accomplish overall. And as John already indicated, while it has a drag on earnings for 2020 we are not changing our outlook as a result of that. That is small item in the broad scheme of things. And I think we are to discuss flu with OptumHealth.","Wyatt Decker","Yes, Stephen, thank you for the question. At OptumHealth and OptumCare, we follow the usual flu modeling and we have not seen a material impact deviating from that in Q4 and we do not anticipate significant impact in Q1. As you may know, it\u2019s been a reasonably robust flu season, but it\u2019s mostly of the B strain which is not as severe. So we also have a fee-for-service MedExpress practice, which tends to offset any hit we might take on the risk side. Thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Wyatt. Just I want to clarify one thing that Ricky asked and I am not so sure we answered it correctly. It\u2019s really about whether or not in Diplomat, the proposed transaction is in our numbers for 2021 and \u2013 or 2020 and the answer to that is no, it would not be in there. We don\u2019t include transaction in our forecast until they closed. So that is not included in there. And as soon as it does close the quarter following we will update our forecast accordingly. This is one of the reasons why we talked about the impact of capital deployment on our growth rate and how it can advance during the year because of transactions. In this case, it will be very, very modest, but nonetheless, I just wanted to make sure we have that clarification. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So actually not to beat the Diplomat Pharmacy acquisition topic at that, but I know it\u2019s not a huge acquisition for you financially, but despite that, I do have to believe there would just almost immediately be a ton of operational synergies when folding that book of business into your existing PBM and specialty pharmacy operations, probably in reimbursement and also in pharmacy network contracts? So I guess I was hoping to hear more color around what you see is the biggest area of synergy at this stage? And then just conceptually, could this deal move the needle for UNH overall in 2021, obviously you are making it sound like probably in 2020 not much, but could it move the needle for the company overall in 2021? Thanks.","David Wichmann","It will be nicely accretive to us. Unfortunately, it also comes with a great deal of integration costs, most of which will hit 2020 as well. And would you like to touch on that, John?","John Prince","Steven it\u2019s John Prince. Just maybe touch a bit more on why we are doing the deal, because I think that\u2019s really at the core of it which was to better serve individuals that have complex diseases like oncology, immunology and specialized infusion therapy. When you look at the capabilities of Diplomat around specialty pharmacy and infusion, it fits well with the strategy of OptumRx focused on these unique populations that need better volume, helping improve their drug cost, improving their health outcomes and overall value of care and doing it in a compassionate way. So, we think it is a good fit of our two businesses that come together to better serve the key needs in the market. And so as we have talked about before strategically especially drug cost is a key focus for the future as well as polyclinics and I think that strategically fits very well. We are obviously still little ways away from closing the transaction. We are actively doing our planning for that. And we will be ready to start that as we conclude the transaction in the first quarter.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Yes, no problem. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Maybe just going back to the flu, I just wanted to confirm that those earlier comments also apply to the UnitedHealthcare side as well. You have seen high outpatient activity but severity in hospitalizations just don\u2019t appear to be that high at least published yet?","David Wichmann","Jeff Putnam?","Jeff Putnam","Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, on the UnitedHealthcare side similar dynamics, the flu season as you see in the CDC data started early and we are having elevated incident levels on the outpatient side, but overall severity as was mentioned is lower there and in-patient admits have been close to normal, so very modest impact in the fourth quarter.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Michael. Next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. You are rolling out certain initiatives and benefit design changes to your fully insured book around site of service initiatives and prior off along with preferred lab network, etcetera and it sounded like that actually benefited some \u2013 to some degree in the fourth quarter. Can you give us maybe a little bit of a sense of what proportion of the ASO book has adopted these initiatives maybe for 2020 and\/or how we should think about sort of the uptake over time? Thanks.","David Wichmann","I don\u2019t think we will talk about adoption rates in the large national accounts business, but Dirk, do you want to talk a little bit about your overall efforts around containing medical costs?","Dirk McMahon","Yes. As we think about medical costs, you mentioned very effectively site of service being rolled that out to a lot more codes in November, knees and procedures like that. We are also very focused on our network negotiations to try to drive unit costs lower in many areas. As we look at our trend, two-thirds of unit costs, the network is at the start of that. We are doing a lot of work in terms of increasing consumer engagement providing with them with effective decision tools to rally in our other apps portal to other digital properties to drive the right movements and also got to thank Optum, a lot of work with our clinical models driving savings as well as payment integrity as Andrew mentioned in his remarks. So, we really have a full forward press on affordability. We think that is a primary driver of our ability to price effectively in the market and actually provide access for consumers and employers and everyone, so a lot of work on the affordability front.","David Wichmann","Dirk and team at UnitedHealthcare are doing a wonderful job on affordability broadly in medical cost. Obviously, they are interested in getting healthcare to be much more affordable and the collaboration between Optum UnitedHealthcare has never been stronger in that front. Optum has really stepped in as they do with all the third-party health plans as well. It\u2019s really assist in driving this broad-based agenda across the company. We have time for two more questions. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Great. Does that mean I get to ask two questions? No.","David Wichmann","Pardon me.","Gary Taylor","I was going to say, great, does that mean I get to ask two questions?","David Wichmann","You can. We will answer the first one.","Gary Taylor","I will ask just my question. My one question is I do appreciate the earnings cadence commentary given the leap year, but thinking since reported MLR is such an outsized impact on the near-term stock volatility, wondering if you would be willing to give us first quarter MLR range, I mean there are a few other moving parts in the quarter besides leap year that was pretty high March seasonality with extra Monday, Tuesday and then obviously with the dilutive impact of the HIT reinstatement?","David Wichmann","John Rex you, maybe just, I know that was pretty complex in terms of quarterly progression and we expected that. So John, you just want to make sure that everybody understands that well.","John Rex","Sure, Gary. Good morning. Let me give you a little more color in terms of the impact that occurs as we go into that, but I described kind of some of the impacts with workdays content and how that flows. And just in terms of thinking about that, so when value different days with different medical costs, weekends versus weekdays even versus different days of the week. In terms of what I was describing there, it actually comes out to it, it\u2019s a little \u2013 it\u2019s not two days, it\u2019s more than one day, it\u2019s about 1.3 days of impact in terms of the workday content is where it fall then to when you flow into a leap year like that and that pattern, typically of course repeats. So that\u2019s kind of the element that flows into that. Then if you consider the other elements we talked about at \u2013 when we talk to our full year MCR progression and year-over-year progression, we talked about the impact of the health insurance tax of 140 basis points and that impact and then we talked about mix impacts also that occur over the course of the year. So those are really kind of the cores that are as we consider, as we consider where we would expect the medical care ratio to be lining up here as we look at the first half of the year. I hope that gives you a little extra color.","Gary Taylor","So you don\u2019t want to give us a 1Q range today?","John Rex","Sorry, what\u2019s that, Gary?","Gary Taylor","You don\u2019t want to give us the first quarter MLR rate\u2026","John Rex","First quarter pick. I think I kind of just described it actually pretty, pretty hopefully fairly clearly there in terms of the roll forward and how you would approach that. So if you take the components of the math that I just gave you I think that should get you to a first quarter pick.","David Wichmann","So there is no change to full year guidance. John tried to layout for you our first half last half would be and then within the first half what the proportions would be as well. So you should be able to get a pretty good sense of things from all of that recognizing oftentimes things don\u2019t shoot quite that straight. So plus or minus would probably be a worthwhile range to put around whatever point estimate you come up with. Thank you very much Gary. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thanks for squeezing me in. Now that there is some bipartisan support for spread pricing though, can you talk about the exposure in \u201819 you said it was about 25% of the book so did that needle move for \u201820, what is the mix look like in your commercial book of spread versus pass through? And does this bill impact the value proposition that you see for OptumRx at all? Thanks.","David Wichmann","John?","John Rex","Sarah thanks for the question. As you know, we are committed to driving to a strategy around negotiating with the clients of a transparent model where more and more of our services are coming from administrative fees and value-based arrangements. Our clients decide how they want to pay for our services. So when we bid on a deal and for our client, we give them an opportunity either to pay through administrative fee or with spread or traditional. So it\u2019s the client choice. So as you look at it, we don\u2019t have a preference about where we want to go up in business model. We are in different on how a client wanted to choose it. In terms of the commercial market, the trend in the market hasn\u2019t changed in the last several years. So actually the client is not going to move one way or the other in terms of spread versus administrative fee. As you look at the Medicaid market, there has been a trend over the last three years where more and more of the state organizations and have been moving to administrative fees. So if you looked at our client base 3 years ago, majority would have been spread. If you look at it today, less than a quarter is in spread and actually we expect that to almost disappear as you look out next year or 2 years. So from us when they actually impact our financials, I won\u2019t speculate about what will happen in Washington, but we are well positioned from a business standpoint.","David Wichmann","Great question, Sarah. Thank you so much. I will go ahead and close now. Thank you all for your questions. Sorry, we can\u2019t get to everyone today. As you heard this morning, we remain confident in our outlook for 2020 and beyond. Our diversified and complementary businesses are strong and well-positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering even higher levels of societal value, while generating strong returns for you, our shareholders. Thank you and this concludes today\u2019s call.","Operator","And this does indeed conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation.

I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 19, 2012, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we will discuss our first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2012. As we said at the start of the year, we are committed to further improving our overall performance in 2012 with continued focus on fundamental execution and practical innovations that serve to modernize the health care sector from health benefits to health services. ","As we've told you consistently, we greatly respect the headwinds facing us this year. Yet longer term, fundamental market needs for improved health care access, affordability, quality and simplicity continue to grow, regardless of legal or legislative processes. These enduring needs define the dramatic market opportunities that stand before us, as we continue to evolve and grow. ","Steady growth across our enterprise is evident today. It ranges from the honor of serving TRICARE beneficiaries to services and technologies supporting integrated care and forward-looking accountable care models. From significant new pharmacy management engagements to states accelerating their pursuits of managed Medicaid solutions to employee benefits for state governments and large commercial employers, from expanding Medicare market dynamics to statewide health information exchanges. ","This breadth of growth reflects the diversity of the UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses, their complementary alignment and the value of the core competencies of care management, information and technology they both leverage. ","In the first quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.31 per share on revenues of $27.3 billion, an increase in revenue of 7% year-over-year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 40 basis points year-over-year due to higher medical and rebate reserve developments and continued focus on delivering affordable, high-quality health care. ","As expected, our operating cost ratio increased 80 basis points, driven by the continued strong growth in services at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum, combined with the investments we are making to advance our Optum businesses and particularly our pharmacy services. Adjusted cash flows of $1.1 billion were in line with our expectations. We ended the quarter with a debt to total capital ratio of 31% and $1.1 billion in available cash. First quarter annualized return on equity was once again strong at 19.4%. ","Let's review our business results starting with UnitedHealthcare, which is accelerating its distinctive and broad-based growth pace. After adding 2.6 million consumers with medical benefits over the past 2 calendar years, UnitedHealthcare grew by another 1 million people in the past 90 days. That number is now expected to grow by another 700,000 to 900,000 through the balance of 2012, and we have successfully secured the TRICARE West contract effective mid-2013.","UnitedHealthcare is serving sophisticated employers by combining advanced technology with personalized approaches that really reach consumers and help them take more control of their health. We are advancing newer more consumer-centric products for smaller businesses that value affordability and cost control. ","For consumers, UnitedHealthcare offers affordability, responsive service and an enhanced care experience through our innovative mobile technology offerings. And we offer government sponsors a reliable partner who provides cost control for their budgets and high-quality branded offerings to serve their constituents. Execution of these value propositions at the local market level, one consumer at a time, drives consistent sustained growth.","Let's review some of the details. In the first quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew fee-based benefits to serve 765,000 more consumers. We added 65,000 people in Medicaid, more than 250,000 in Medicare Advantage and 105,000 in supplemental Medicare benefits. In the process, we strengthened our business nationally with distinctive chronic care capabilities through the acquisition of XLHealth. Our Medicare Advantage business now serves 2.5 million American seniors and beneficiaries.","As expected, risk-based commercial enrollment decreased 190,000 people in the first quarter, with about half of the decrease due to conversion to fee-based products by large public sector clients that we retained. And because of additional in-year engagements, we are now increasing our membership growth projection for UnitedHealthcare by more than 750,000 -- with 750,000 people to a range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million new consumers for 2012. This includes growth of 1.1 million to 1.2 million people in fee-based commercial benefits due to the combination of strong retention and new business awards for both new and existing customers in the national account market. We have also received recent awards for a midyear 2012 implementations of state employer programs in Texas and Nebraska. ","Full year risk-based commercial membership is tracking with our previous outlook in the down range of 100,000 to 200,000 for 2012. Including XLHealth, we foresee an increase of roughly 350,000 people in Medicare Advantage for 2012. Our 2 pending South Florida acquisitions would increase this further, both are locally prominent businesses with well-earned reputations for good management and fundamental local execution. And this is an important region for expansion, as South Florida continues to grow its senior population. These acquisitions strengthen our market presence there.","We project our Medicare Supplement business will exceed the upper end of our prior outlook for the year. And as you know, in stand-alone Part D, the market bid [ph] well below UnitedHealthcare in many regions causing the decline of 615,000 people in the first quarter, more than we had originally projected, with most of it in the subsidized, low income market segment.","Medicaid business growth remains fully on track for the year. We gained the largest share of membership in the first phase of Louisiana's new program this past quarter. We hope to continue to serve well as subsequent phases are introduced. And we recently were privileged to receive a new award in Ohio.  Again, we are increasing our overall outlook for 2012 medical benefits growth by more than 750,000 people across the full spectrum of our product offerings.","UnitedHealthcare's first quarter margin of 8.1% was stronger than planned, as results benefited from favorable items that are not considered recurring in nature. They include $130 million in favorable true-ups to our 2011 commercial rebate reserves as we updated our estimates and complied with final federal and state regulatory guidance received during the quarter, as well as including favorable medical reserve development across all UnitedHealthcare business units. ","Our next commercial premium yields are coming in consistent with our November outlook. Our commercial care ratio is now expected to be at the lower end of our original outlook and is affected by the first quarter's favorable items. We now expect the ratio of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points, for the full year.","Based on first quarter data, there is no cost to change our forecast for commercial and medical cost trends this year of about 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Unit cost remain the primary driver of medical costs. Utilization trends remain moderate, with outpatient usage continuing to be the strongest utilization category and inpatient activity remaining restrained. ","We continue to develop innovative programs to advance the quality and affordability of our products and improve our underlying cost structure, and UnitedHealthcare's operations performed well in the first quarter. The strong growth in customers and consumers across businesses was handled smoothly with positive responsiveness and strong customer service. Operating costs were well controlled. Overall, we're please with UnitedHealthcare's start for 2012.","Optum, our health services business platform, is unique in the marketplace. Offering a depth and breadth of capabilities, which help modernize the health care system. Our enabling tools and services support health care providers, payers, employers, governments and consumers. We align these capabilities along 8 distinct markets, which we size at $500 billion in the aggregate, and our current share at only 6%. All of this we detailed for you at our November Investor Conference. ","We see accelerating opportunity over the next several years as the market evolves from narrow, highly fragmented, single product purchase decisions to customers seeking larger, more integrated and comprehensive solutions. In such an environment, we believe Optum's capabilities will be increasingly differentiated. ","Optum revenues of $7.3 billion in the quarter increased 8% year-over-year. Our integrated care delivery business was a significant contributor as it continues to develop and as we expand our footprint in this marketplace. This gain was partially offset by the sale of our clinical trials business late in the second quarter of last year. ","In pharmacy management, we expanded the number of people served and saw a growth in specialty pharma and mail services. These offset the higher-than-expected decline in Part D volumes and revenues. Compliant services for hospitals and payment integrity services for payers were strong in the quarter. Technology offerings and related service revenues benefited from Optum's rising market profile and reputation. ","Across our provider facing markets, our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions differentiate this. One much discussed example is the growing development of accountable care organizations, an opportunity we define more broadly than regulatory definition alone. As core fiscal and demographic pressures accelerate, the need for providers to connect and integrate, share data, deploy predictive technology and assume risk will also accelerate. This is an intersection of capabilities where Optum is exceptionally well positioned.","In general, strong sales to health care providers and plan sponsors lifted sales bookings for technology and related service offerings 18% year-over-year. The OptumInsight contract backlog increased 25% to more than $4 billion, both as adjusted. We continue to project overall Optum revenues in the area of $30 billion for the year. ","First quarter Optum earnings of $252 million were in line with our expectations. The 30 basis point margin decline and decrease of $27 million from the fourth quarter and $70 million year-over-year was primarily due to planned investments across our business infrastructure. Pharmacy services being one of these, and the decline in Part D volumes partially offset by incremental earnings contribution from newer businesses, such as integrated care delivery. ","Across the entire Optum platform, we are adding significant capabilities as we prepare to take this enterprise to a new level of performance. And we anticipated these factors would impact our year-over-year comparisons for the first half.","And as we shared with you at our Investor Conference, we're committed to more than doubling Optum's 2011 operating earnings by 2015. This requires a focused, clear and simple plan. And let us as give you a few of its key elements. Optum expects to drive roughly 1\/2 of its earnings growth through 2015 by expanding revenues from key product groups across its 8 core markets. Those 8 markets serve as the foundation. They are less mature, less regulated than our health benefit businesses, and fully lend themselves to the application of our core capabilities in care management and delivery, data analytics and technology. ","Examples of opportunities for Optum's growth include integrated care delivery, coordination of services for the frail elderly and serious chronic care needs under expanded state and federal programs, expansion in compliance services in a dynamic growing regulatory environment, pharmacy management awards from external clients, and broader development of outsourced technology and services for benefit plans and care providers.","The second major component driving us towards 2015 target is the repatriation of all UnitedHealth Group pharmacy management services by the end of 2013. And finally, there will be a sizable contribution from the tighter integration of businesses, products and processes across Optum and stronger overall operating cost management. These opportunities lie in tightening alignment and performance around our 8 markets and related product sets with a more mature approach to larger and longer term customer relationships. ","We will meaningfully reduce costs across all of Optum by leveraging Optum's enterprise resources and new leadership team. We'll focus spending more directly on improvements in service and further innovation. This requires the right personnel and the right roles, so we continue to move our best leaders to areas that play to their strongest skill set and bring in new talented executives where they can add value.","We believe this plan will release meaningful growth and earnings in Optum by focusing resources on markets where we see a high probability of success, repatriating our pharmacy business, maturing and better integrating our products and businesses and simplifying our administrative structure. Optum is solidly on track with the plans we discussed last fall to deliver operating earnings in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for 2012. This is a moderate advance from 2011, while still shouldering significant incremental development expenses of well over $150 million in 2012.","We are committed to distinctive earnings performance and capital returns. We previously characterized 2012 as a buildout year and we expect steady progress over the course of the year. We are confident in our commitment to achieve a doubling of the return on invested capital from the Optum platform by 2015, and indeed see the long-term opportunities for this business as significant and our market position as strong.","To sum up, against the challenging environment, UnitedHealth Group had a strong first quarter characterized by growth across the enterprise, continued cost control, positive earnings and effective financing and capital use. Based on these early results, we now project revenues of $109 billion to $110 billion and net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95 in 2012. This is a $0.17 plus increase at the mid-point from our prior outlook. ","Cash flows from operations will advance as well to a new range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. These projections are measured and prudent, an appropriate first quarter posture. They recognize growth momentum, while weighing significant pressure points on some of our businesses, including that revised reserve estimate benefited UnitedHealthcare's first quarter medical care ratio and operating earnings. Medicare Part D memberships in volumes are behind plan at this point, impacting both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. ","The opportunity to provide services in 2013 to military families through TRICARE will require meaningful ramp-up expenses and capital. In-year growth in fee-based benefits and services is putting upward pressure on the operating cost ratio. Premium yields on risk-based products are constrained by government budgets in a tight but rationale competitive environment. We continue to expect a gradual rise in medical system utilization over the balance of the year. ","Sequential second quarter earnings per share could run behind what we reported for first quarter 2012, more in line with the second quarter of last year. Continued investments in building our Optum businesses will keep its second quarter margins in check and UnitedHealthcare should perform at a more natural earnings run rate than it did this quarter. ","As always, we are committed to delivering our best performance. We like our market position and growth prospects. We have the opportunity to shift -- to grow share at UnitedHealthcare, and we have the opportunity to advance Optum to a new performance level by better serving the broad needs of the participants in health care. Central to both are our core competencies, our commitments to quality, service and innovation and a collaborative, accountable high-performance culture that pulls it all together. ","I will now turn this call back to our moderator for questions. I apologize that we never seem to get all of you in despite holding to one question per person. And again, thank you for joining us today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys go over a little bit more about trends and utilization in the quarter? I know you said it stayed -- you had no reason to come off your 6% guidance. But can you talk about specifics around some of the sub segments of utilization, inpatient doctors and then also, just if there'd be any regional differences or by product?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dan?","Dan Schumacher","This is Dan Schumacher. So I would be remiss if I didn't start the conversation with a reminder that our trend, the vast majority of our trend is driven by unit cost increases year in and year out on our commercial business. So with that said, I'll move to utilization. From a utilization perspective, we have incorporated in our outlook historically, as well as going forward, a progressive increase in utilization over the balance of the year. And we had incorporated a portion of that in the first quarter. And as we look at our first quarter results, they're tracking right in line with our expectations, which is to say that we saw a modest increase in utilization in the first quarter. As you look across both the platform as well as by categories, we saw that increase pretty consistently across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial. And then as you look at the categories, as Steve mentioned, outpatient is the place where we see most increase. And on the inpatient side, we actually continue to see that very restrained. Our hospital bed days are actually flat to down in each of our businesses across the platform.","Stephen J. Hemsley","All of which is pretty consistent with what we've been seeing.","Dan Schumacher","Absolutely. And that's why our view on our trend for the full year remains unchanged. So we're still at 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I were to subtract out all of your favorable PPD in the quarter I get a higher loss ratio than you suggested in your guidance. So is that to say that maybe put back up a lot of that PPD in the quarter?","Dan Schumacher","I wouldn't read into that. Certainly, when we get to the end of each month and quarter, we are picking through our best estimates of ultimate reserve outcomes and ultimate medical expense, so we have no expectation of development forward. Certainly, the development we recorded in the first quarter influences our 2011 trend, which is a little bit better than what we were thinking when we closed out the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","To follow-up on the favorable reserve question. Can you break down how much of that came from each of your subsegments? And when you report the $530 million, does that include the loss ratio rebate impact in commercial -- for the commercial portion of it?","Dan Schumacher","Ana, this is Dan Schumacher again. First, I think, one important reminder is that when we're talking about development, that is measuring a change in our medical reserves, whereas our rebates are incorporated in premium. So development in and of itself is not influenced by rebates. Certainly, our rebates are influenced by our development. In terms of where we got development this quarter and where we saw it, we saw it broadly across all 3 of our business platforms, including commercial, Medicaid and Medicare.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So I'm understanding $530 million, the rebates were accrued on the premium line item. Then the $130 million that you came in sounds like more favorably. Is that because you overestimated trends for the last year and so you over accrued? And can you just give us some color on that?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. On the true-up of our rebate accrual for 2011 in the first quarter, there are a host of factors that obviously influenced that. We're measuring it across 350 intersections. And so there are changes in estimates. But also importantly, there were changes to state and federal guidelines that it came down in the first quarter that influenced the rebate result for 2011.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And what specifically, if I might just finish up there on what the guideline changes were?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. On the federal side, it was with regard to how capitations would be treated. And on the state side, it was more around how the definition of small group would be, whether it went from 1 to 50 or 1 to 100.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. I guess, maybe just following up then on the rebate comments. Just want to understand a little bit better, when you guys -- obviously, when you accrue on the cost side of margin for a favorable development, do you have -- or, sorry, for adverse development, do you do a similar thing on the rebate side? Do you build in like a margin for favorable development that we might expect in Q1 to have generally a positive true-up there or is that more a specific line? I just want to understand how unusual this 130 is.","Dan Schumacher","Kevin, this is Dan again. It is -- that is the adverse margin deviation you're talking about. That's unique to medical. That's not something that relates to the rebate. And I would tell you that this is a unique item for this year. But I would say it is -- the rebates and the reserves are basically estimates. They are done based upon the performance of the book. And as a result, those estimates change like any accrual from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. So it is just a normal factor. It does not have a structural element though, as you suggest as the adverse deviation would be.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Then one quick one. Is the cash flow guidance simply just the lower rebate payout in 2012? Is that why it's that?","Stephen J. Hemsley","No. I think there's a variety of factors. The cash flow guidance is really a result of the improved earnings performance of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you a question about duals. And as you evaluate and talk to states and look at the blanket of opportunities, could you give us a sense of how many situations do you think its going to be more of a direct to the incumbents process versus how many situations do you think you'll be actually able to show your frail elderly care capabilities through XL and INSPIRIS, et cetera, and actually compete for perhaps even a larger share?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think that's framed very well, it's a good question that we'll kind of go at it in 2 directions. So we'll start with UnitedHealthcare, but then I think Optum will also comment on the duals.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. This is Gail Boudreaux. Let me frame that broadly because I think you asked the right question, which is who's -- how well are you positioned to compete in the duals market. And from our perspective, we think we're extremely well positioned because we have really strong franchises in both Medicare and Medicaid, and serve a number of the chronically ill populations already through our complex care. The XLHealth acquisition also offers us some very unique capabilities, the in-house calls and we're looking to deploy those more broadly. So we think that the combination of both our footprint in Medicaid at the state level working very closely with these populations, as well as the skills that we bring to Medicare, offer us those capabilities. And I know that the combination of what we're bringing from our Optum site as well. I'm going to ask Jack Larsen, who leads our Medicaid business, to give you some comments specifically about some of the state opportunities that we're looking at and then we'll ask Optum to share with you some of their capabilities as well.","Jack Larsen","Jeff Larsen. I guess I would say at some level, we are working with all of our 25 state partners. As you know, many of those states have posted the outlines of the demonstration plans seeking stakeholder comments. And then, ultimately, proposing it to CMS some time later this spring. I'd say where we are an incumbent Medicaid or incumbent Medicare dual slip plan sponsor. I think we're in very good shape. I think we bring the best of both of those worlds to bear for the benefit of the dual eligible population. So whether it goes to somebody who is not in the state or to an incumbent, I guess, I would say, as I look at our opportunities, I really like our position in most of our states. Let me ask Rick or I guess Larry to take a look at the services...","Stephen J. Hemsley","Larry, do you want to take duals from an Optum perspective?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Larry?","Larry C. Renfro","Sure. I'm going to pass this to Rick Jelinek in a second. But I just wanted to make a comment on kind of the market and some of the things that we're seeing. We're being approached as, what I'll call an unregulated infrastructure services capability. And as we proceed down the road on this, there's a couple of organizations within Optum that Rick will talk about and how they kind of fit. But as Gail said, this we see as a very, very strong opportunity and we're pretty well positioned. Rick?","Rick Jelinek","Thanks, Larry and thanks for the question. This is Rick Jelinek. As you know, we are a very large service provider to dual populations today on both the Medicare and Medicaid side on behalf of UnitedHealthcare, but as well as on behalf of state customers and other payers. We're a provider of primary care services in physician offices, as well as in long-term care facilities for residents that are permanently placed in an institutional setting and dual eligible. We also provide a series of specialty services through our PBM, our behavioral health businesses and another network products like our transplant services business, which are also covering a large population at the dual eligible market. And maybe most importantly, we have a full range of care management and disease management programs for all levels of care that are done telephonically in the home setting through our organizations like INSPIRIS and within provider setting. We can deliver these programs at scale. We have excellent outcomes on the business and we're doing this today with, as I mentioned health plans and directly with states. So we feel we're well positioned across all of our UnitedHealth Group businesses. We think we have some very compelling integrated solution for the dual market.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So whether it's directly through a program through UnitedHealthcare or through enabling support through Optum, we will serve that population.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Thank you very much especially for the explanation of how United is intending to grow Optum. Unfortunately, I can't use my one question to ask about Optum. I need to ask a question about the commercial membership situation. I know that you did discuss this several times that you did expect there to be a contraction in the number of lives that you serve. But if you could, I'd like to understand this because given all of the improvements that you appear to be making in affordability, simplicity and the appeal of the products, the service of products, it seems a little bit contradictory, as it were, that you would be losing lives on the risk-based products. So can you just walk me through what the situation is there and what the opportunity is to turn that around going forward?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Why don't we start with Gail and then Jeff Alter can respond.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","This is Gail Boudreaux. So first, our overall growth was very robust as you saw in the commercial market space. We grew 575,000 total lives and had very, very strong fee-based growth. So we're really pleased with that. As you look at the risk-based growth, we knew that was going to happen. And let me sort of walk you through the pieces of it. We lost 190,000 lives in the quarter, but that was really driven by a couple of large public sector conversion accounts and one large public sector loss. If you look underneath the membership for the quarter in risk-based, we actually had a robust small business group, growth in small business rather, which we think is a strong indicator of the value-based products we put in the marketplace. And we would expect to see improvement over the year, given our guidance of 100,000 to 200,000 loss, which is our expectation. So the big driver for the loss was really the conversions in the large public sector accounts that occurred in January. And then maybe I'll ask Jeff to comment on just out of the products that we're putting in the marketplace and your view of the state uptick in that.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Sheryl, it's Jeff Alter. Just to add to Gail's statement, the kind of the overall top level is a little bit deceiving as to kind of the fundamental growth that's going on in our marketplace underneath -- on the fully insured business. We're seeing some very nice uptake on some of our more value-based products now or in network, some with gatekeepers. So we're actually very pleased in the performance of our new products, as well as our overall fully insured block of business.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And I would just add, that's a very competitive sector of the marketplace. We are committed to holding on to pricing disciplines. And I think that's clearly a factor in that small group risk-based category.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","How do you think of the risk reward of bidding in state insurance exchanges as opposed to offering a similarly structured and priced product outside of the exchange? And where are you in the process of establishing this product that would mirror the low-cost exchange option in key markets with respect to development and understanding the margin that, that product may have?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, that one could take the balance of the morning. But I will start with UnitedHealthcare in terms of kind of the technical side of your question. And then, perhaps, a perspective from Optum as well. So want to start with this?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. This is Gail Boudreaux. Let me frame your question first broadly, because I think you have a couple of different things embedded in your question. The first around the positioning on the public exchanges. One, we're in the process of -- we're actually engaged with the states and we are taking all the necessary steps inside of our organization to prepare. As we look at that, all the guidance is not out, so we haven't made our final determination. But as you think about the preparations that we're making around value-based products, network configurations, clinical engagement, all of those things we are putting in the marketplace now. And we have many of our members already, cost and effectiveness of those products is already in place. So to answer your question, we're looking at that market now and we're preparing for the public exchange. On the private exchange side, we believe that cost and quality will be important, consumer engagement will be important and effective clinical models. So those 3 components. And we've got products in our market today that we are in the process of introducing and have begun that process.","Larry C. Renfro","This is Larry Renfro. From the Optum side, again, it's kind of like the duals. Optum is positioned as what I'll call an unregulated infrastructure with a lot of services and capability. And I think the way that you could think about it is that we can enable as open architecture. Meaning that, if you're familiar with, and most people would be familiar with 401(k) plans and how 401(k) plans kind of have open architecture with investment products, the way Optum is structuring its technology is to have that type of open environment for different health plans and so fourth. So we actually do that with a private exchange today, and we believe those capabilities are going to play well in the future.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So Mike, the discussion on duals, direct participation through UnitedHealthcare and enabling participation through Optum.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I want to revisit a question I asked last quarter because I think we crossed wires. And ask maybe a little bit more clearly. Could you talk about how you are steering to various providers? How you're lowering overall cost and where you are? What inning are you in and what mechanisms are you using to steer utilization to the lower overall cost providers?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, I might frame it from the perspective of how are we incenting the marketplace to use the best resources, and those resources to perform at their best levels. So I think that's more in the United health care domain and maybe start with Gail and Jeff.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Christine, let me try to frame your answer at a couple of different levels and hopefully get to the specifics that you're looking for. As we think about this, the value comes from really a combination of a couple of levers. The first is network configuration, which you just mentioned. But importantly is plan design and how we engage consumers and care and cost decisions. And the third is clinical engagement. So we build the products, we're looking for essentially a 10% to 15% price differential. Specific to your question around network configuration. The difficulty in answering it broadly is it does vary market to market and based on how the delivery system is configured and structured. But to put an example on that, when you look at our premium designation network, which we've had in place now for over 6 years. It includes 21 specialties, 145 markets. Roughly, when you look at physicians who practice at a quality and efficiency around evidence-based medicine in the 75th percentile. Roughly 50% of the doctors qualify in those specialties to be in the premium designation network. And of those doctors who qualify, their cost are about 19% less than their peers in those markets. So that gives you a perspective of the kind of scale we're talking about. And importantly, within those markets, we're also looking for an improvement in quality. So knee surgery would be a great example. Those premium designated doctors have about 60% lower complication rate, which drive the lower cost profile. The same thing with spine fusion, roughly a 42% lower complication rate for our premium designated doctors driving a much lower cost profile. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of the kind of dynamics that we can drive in the marketplace.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And what inning do you think you're in? Is this a note [ph] a constant process?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","It's an evolving process. And I would say we're in the early innings because we've had the premium designation network for roughly 6 years, so that's very mature. But now we're moving up this continuum of more pay per performance against the last -- we've quoted a number of roughly 15% of our in-network spend is in these type of arrangements. We're looking to significantly increase that number over the next few years. So I would say early inning, there's a lot of improvement in data and technology. But over the next several years, that's going to dramatically improve because products are being built around this and the networks are being configured that way.","Jeff Alter","Christine, it's Jeff Alter. One of the other areas -- we've done a really nice job starting with the premium designation program, creating products around premium designation. And then just as of April 1, we just released our next-generation consumer tool called My Health Care Cost Estimator. We really think this is the next inning, if we want to continue the baseball analogy. This tool allows our members to be better consumers of health care. It gives them a health care shopping experience that allows the member to compare prices and quality for physicians. And since it's released, we've gotten very positive feedback from our clients and the people that we serve. Mainly because it's a really highly functioning tool that delivers the information in a simple, very personal way. And it's a experience that goes beyond just a web tool. It's integrated with our customer service model. Our treatment decision support models and any questions that the members might have around that. And it really is a first-generation release, the game changer, what we think is going to be really revolutionary will happen some time in the midsummer where that data will be actual contacted reimbursement rates. Therefore, that level of pricing accuracy that the member will experience as they shop for health care, as they do other products is really going to change. We think that's -- this could be a good game changer for the second half of the game.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Christine, I also wanted to clarify one thing in terms of the 50% of our network spend is in pay per performance modality. So I just want to make sure that was clear because I know I was talking about premium designation as well.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And I'll just summarize by saying, basically, what you heard is an alignment that's really, never really happened before. An alignment between how products are designed, how our consumer engagement tools are designed to work with those products, also designed to work with our clinical programs and how those clinical programs are designed to work with our high-performance networks. And that alignment and the enablement across of it has never really, I don't think has ever gotten to these levels before so -- and we think this is very early.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Interested if you can help spike out when you think about the 1.1 million to 1.2 million fee-based member adds. How that's breaking out between large public sector client wins versus employers? And then maybe talk about some of the key factors that are driving your share gains in the public sector market, particularly against the nonprofit blues?","Stephen J. Hemsley","We'll respond to that. I don't think we'd respond specifically to competitors. We'll just talk about the market in general.","Jeff Alter","Scott, it's Jeff Alter. The majority of our growth in the first quarter happened in employer based, traditional commercial. Some of the increase in our outlook for the future is the big wins in Texas and Nebraska. So to sum up both sides of that growth, I would say that our value proposition, the network economics that we drive. But more importantly, the recognition that some of the tools that we spoke about, our product design, some of our network configuration designs really are beginning to take hold and to be noticed as different than everyone else. And that's -- that has powered our momentum to date and continues to change our outlook for the future for growth particularly in public sector and some of the larger commercial clients.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And how much runway do you think you still have on the public sector? Do you have an estimate of what your share of those commercial, large public sector clients is right now?","Jeff Alter","I don't have specifics. But there are still a number of large states that are not our clients that we would hope that our success in our existing state relationships and the 2 new ones coming up this year will open eyes in other states as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'll try and ask a quick one. I guess I was just surprised not to hear about the favorable weather, I guess for you, unfavorable weather, as well as the impact of leap year. So just curious if that had any impact in the first quarter as it relates to medical cost trend and\/or your MLRs?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, if you'd like to hear about that, we've got the right guy for you, Dan.","Dan Schumacher","So last year, obviously, we had a bunch of inclement weather. This year, we've got a little better flu. Those 2 things are about a wash across the entire platform. And certainly, the extra day in the first quarter of this year is adding to our medical expense in the first quarter this year as compared to last. And those I think are the components.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But when you talk about your 6% frame. I mean, I'm just trying to figure out is that an apples-to-apples sort of a PMPM base trend? Or is that inclusive of the fact that you had additional services because there was an extra day?","Dan Schumacher","Our trend is on a full year basis, obviously. And it is at the core a PMPM comparison, per member per month comparison. And so it would incorporate the extra day. And then as you look at the composition of those days over the balance of the year, there's some ins and outs and washes. It gets muted over the full year.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So it's only say like a 30 basis point impact for the whole year. But apples-to-apples, your trend would be lower without this leap year? Your MLR would be lower without it, right?","Dan Schumacher","True.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My question is related to medical trend and maybe to continue from Christine's question. Just when you step back and look at the overall secular trend and how much below that secular trend we are right now. I want to understand how much of that is cyclical factors versus structural factors? And Steve, you outlined several of the structural changes that you're driving as a company. So maybe you can answer this in 2 ways. One, how do you measure this pace of structural change? What's on your dashboard for number of ACOs, percent of physicians and known group, things that you really monitored to measure that pace of change. And then, b, how much are you bending the trend as a company versus what is simply cyclical weakness in medical trend?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Maybe I'll start this and then hand it off. But I would say, you ask a difficult question, it basically go through the flow of the medical cost trends and be able to parse it as cleanly as your question might suggest. We would love to be able to do that. I think it's -- that is -- that would be quite a challenge. I would say the things that we do measure are things like how much of our total spend is going towards performance and the continued upward trend of the amount of spend that is based upon performance-based metrics, et cetera. We measure things like a basic utilization measures. And we know, from our health care affordability program, that we are getting traction on those and those are fundamental improvements. I think it is very difficult to measure the impact the consumers are having on this by how they are using products and the influence they're having. It is interesting to observe how consumers behave when you put these tools in their hands and put the right kind of incentives in place. I'd also say it's equally interesting to observe how providers respond when these transparency tools go forward and they begin to measure themselves against others who are providing services in their market, et cetera. We'd love to be able to take those kinds of inputs and parse them neatly. But we -- I'm sure we can build a model, but it would be just that. And do you have anything to add to that? It is a great question and it is clearly something we have models on, spend energy on. We do think these elements are all having an impact on it. Can we offer, particularly in the economic background in which we're operating in, that this is a structural rebase lining of medical cost trends? We don't have a basis for that at this point in time. And I think you can see from the guidance that we provide that we are watchful and very respectful of medical cost trends and the more moderate utilization realities that we have been seeing. So I think that's a best answer we can probably give you at the moment. That's a very good question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just 2 maintenance-oriented questions here. Obviously, you bought in $1 billion of stock in the first quarter. Is your guidance for the year still $2.5 billion to $3 billion? Or given the first quarter number, is the run rate tracking a little higher in terms of your internal models? And then secondarily, can you give us a sense for the TRICARE startup headwind?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dave?","David S. Wichmann","Chris, this is Dave Wichmann. We have not changed our guidance with respect to how much share repurchase. We're still estimating somewhere in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year. We did repurchase about 18.5 million shares for total cost of about $990 million in the first quarter. So we would look to expend the balance of that range over the course of the last 3 quarters of this year.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes. And in terms of TRICARE, we are obviously tooling up for that. We've got maybe in the zone of $60 million of costs related to TRICARE preparation between ramping up operationally, as well as some capital investments that have to be made.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And that $60 million, is that in -- was any of that spent in the first quarter?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Not in the first quarter, but it's in our outlook.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Hemsley for any closing remarks.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you. So in closing, I'd like to quickly summarize what we have said today. Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum are on track in meeting our expectations. We are seeing steady growth across the enterprise in virtually every business segment. The breadth of that growth reflects the diversity of our businesses, how they work together to complement and support each other and the enduring value of our competencies and technology information and care coordination. We're increasing our outlook for 2012 net earnings and membership and cash flows. We remain committed to further improving. ","Thank you for joining us today, and that concludes our call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call.

Welcome to UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 15, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review UnitedHealth Group's third quarter results. Our business continues to grow as we develop in respond to large and emerging market opportunities across both the healthcare benefits and services sectors. Healthcare markets worldwide continued to evolve with nations and market participants of all types seeking to build better healthcare systems that are more informed and modern, lower cost simpler and more responsive to consumers. Organizations throughout healthcare are searching for ways to improve by leveraging data and information to more effectively deliver quality care that is measurable and delivered with greater precision and consistency in response to ever increasing pressures around costs, access in transparency. We have consciously positioned UnitedHeathcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group to deliver practical innovation and significant value in this environment.","UnitedHealth Group's third quarter revenues grew 26.6% year-over-year to $41.5 billion, including strong 10% organic revenue growth across our businesses. Consolidated net earnings of $1.65 per share were in line with our expectations as was the net earnings margin which decreased by just over 1% year-over-year reflecting the greater mix of pharmacy care services as well as early stage lower margin individual exchange business, lower levels of reserve development and accelerated investments and improving medicare stars quality principally closing gaps in care for the seniors we serve.","Year-to-date, we have grown net earnings per share by 14% on revenue growth of 17%. Our return on equity of 19% reflects the balance sheets of capital and organic initiatives to build our business. Quarter end days claims payable increased two days sequentially and one day year-over-year. And cash flows from operations continued to be strong at more than 170% of net income this quarter. Year-to-date, cash flows of $6.2 billion have grown by 11% and represented a strong 135% of [indiscernible] income for the nine-month period.","I'll ask Larry Renfro to provide a review of Optum and then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and from UnitedHealth Group Enterprise comments. Larry, you want to take?","Larry Renfro","Thanks, Steve. Optum continues to innovate, to address rising market needs particularly those of larger more sophisticated organization which have complex health, care service deliver and management challenges. Our businesses are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. ","Optum's revenues of $19.3 billion, grew 61% year-over-year this quarter. Our results include Catamaran within OptumRx results for the first time and reflect exceptional overall organic revenue growth of 15%. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues by more than $1 billion or 25% year-over-year to more than $5 billion this quarter.","Third quarter operating margin of 5.9% reflects the increased mix of pharmacy care services revenues as well as integration in intangible amortization costs related to Catamaran. Both OptumHealth and OptumInsight delivered double-digit percentage operating margins in the [indiscernible]. We continue to focus on the opportunities to dramatically elevate value for customers in five large growth markets. Clinical care, pharmacy care services, information and technology solutions, government services, and international.","Our one Optum approach means we build strong, strategic and senior enterprise-level relationships that transcend individual product categories and point solutions. We start by listening closely to our clients, so we understand the issues from their perspectives. We then bring deep experience, creativity strategic partnerships in our own differentiated capabilities in healthcare combined with responsive and practical operational solutions. This can lead to working sessions which often lead to pipeline, backlog in revenue and earnings. ","Optum360 is a good case in point. It has grown to 7500 employees, serving 1600 hospitals, and is helping manage more than $50 billion of their billings. Just last week, customers surveyed by the Black Book a leading research organization ranked Optum360 offerings as the best in the three key product categories for the sector, and we are still in the early stages as hospitals and health systems shift to professionally managed revenue approaches. ","Domestically and in other nations, we are in discussions with high profile healthcare organizations regarding our wide range of technology and information enabled services. We are exploring significant opportunities to serve the healthcare needs of U.S. Federal Government program and talking with prominent healthcare organizations about innovative technology infrastructure and application services and a comprehensive suite of technology enabled payor services. Any one or more of these has potential to develop into a multiyear multibillion-dollar strategic relationship. Across Optum, this type of proactive approach is driving positive results.","Third quarter backlog OptumInsight exceeds $10 billion in value and grew 34% year-over-year on an external basis. Our pipeline is continuing to grow at an exceptional rate as well. The median deal size for OptumHealth is doubled over the past three years. We are delivering more care to more people, to the more payors at Optum Care. We now deliver care to more than 7 million people annually through our Optum Care businesses. Market interest in OptumRX continues to grow in response to the value we can drive through more integrated downstream drug benefit and care management efforts, especially around the growing specialty and pharmaceutical segment.","The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has authorized agencies under its purview to conduct innovative healthcare research with Optum Labs, using Optum Labs big data resources. These indicators should help give you a sense of both our continuing progress and the meaningful opportunities we're developing. We will continue to execute on the details for our clients, with a focus on quality and service and further build our growing reputation for being the trusted partner that gets the job done. We are optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. ","Now let me turn it over to Dave.","Dave Wichmann","Thank you, Larry. United healthcare continues to differentiate its products on the foundations of distinctive quality, service, innovation and value. As a result, UnitedHealthcare has grown domestically to serve nearly 300,000 more people in the third quarter, 1.5 million more people this year, and nearly 1.7 million more people over the past 12 months. We'll enter 2016 with even more distinctive products, capabilities and relationships, and we expect to continue to deliver impressive levels of growth next year as well. ","UnitedHealthcare's third quarter revenues of $32.8 billion grew year-over-year by $2.8 billion or 9.2%, all organic. The UnitedHealthcare operating margin of 5.7% decreased as expected, declining just over 1% year-over-year due to lower levels of reserve development, solid growth in early-stage, lower margin public insurance exchange products, and increased investments in Medicare Stars quality. We continue to expect a full year consolidated care ratio of 80.8% plus or minus 50 basis points likely above the mid-point of that range based on our year-to-date experience.","The annual care ratio is being modestly affected by the performance of our new public exchange benefit programs which now served nearly 550,000 people. Like others we observe market-wide data this past spring that suggested the risk pool served by public exchanges would require more medical services than original expectations. Rather than wait for our own experience with our new members to fully developed, we increased rates and repositioned certain products market by market for 2016, and we expect improved performance next year. We will expand to 11 new markets in 2016, and we continue to expect exchanges to develop and mature over time into a strong viable growth market for us.","We've accelerated the uptake of our medical care quality programs to achieve star ratings beyond the strongly improved levels that the CMS recently published for payment year 2017. Our Medicare stars improvement does come with a related increase in medical costs. We are confident. We have implemented the necessary steps to achieve our goal of 80% or more of our members in four-star or greater programs by payment year 2018. Star quality improvements will strengthen our reimbursement rates in 2016, 2017, and 2018, in which are Medicare advantage program's benefit offerings and further our growth and financial position.","Our 2015 commercial medical cost trend outlook continues to be biased towards the lower portion of our 5.5% to 6.5% full year forecast. In total, UnitedHealthcare has maintained nearly 6% operating margin year-to-date in 2015, identical to the year-to-date margin at this point in 2014. [Driven] by year-to-date organic revenue growth of more than $9 billion UnitedHealthcare has advanced earnings from operations by $540 million which is a growth rate of more than 10%. All three of our benefits businesses are producing strong results. ","Let's turn a review of a couple examples that illustrate how we worked locally and use technology to serve the two most important participants in healthcare, the doctor and the patients. We are increasingly aligned with physicians and hospitals, and we continue on our course to deliver $65 billion or more in care annually by 2018 through value-based care contracts. Today these programs touch as many of 13 million of our consumers delivered in part through more than 650 accountable care arrangements. This includes growth of more than 160 new accountable care arrangements so far this year alone. In many instances, these care providers and UnitedHealthcare bring in Optum to help and manage population risk and improve operational performance on a more systematic organization-wide basis.","Larry has given you a feel for how this trend positively affects demand for Optum's services. Let me give you a few more examples. Together with Optum, we are also supporting physicians' operational needs with Link which we have discussed before. Link is a cloud based digital platform that provides secure workspace and connectivity between physician offices and health plans, enabling them to efficiently communicate and transact business. By year-end 2015, Link will be serving more than 600,000 physicians nationwide. We offer them connectivity to 75 distinct dedicated applications relevant to their operations. We continue to grow both the installed customer base and the portfolio of applications and capabilities. Our ability to fully serve physicians practices with core transactions and information exchange as well as scheduling referral processes, transparency, and other services.","On the patient side with Optum, we increasingly focus on the local community and deliver care and services in people's homes. You have heard about our house call program in Medicare, and we have begun using it in targeted commercial and Medicaid patient situations as well. The more than 1 million house calls, our physicians and nurse practitioners will execute this year increases our medical spend upfront. They encourage people to get annual care visits with our physician, appropriate vaccinations, and so on. The benefits are substantial. We have more satisfied consumers with better healthcare quality, and we protect them from potentially higher medical costs down the road. Consumer satisfaction and retention are significantly strengthened by the house calls experience.","At the community level, we have hundreds of community health workers on the ground, helping address the root causes of healthcare issues for Medicaid members with complex medical conditions. We meet with them in their homes and help them access the health and social services they need to better manage their health. This includes addressing housing, employment, access to healthy food and nutrition as well as transportation and other public support services. Again UnitedHealthcare is improving the quality and consumer satisfaction while helping to reduce exposure to potentially higher costs from untreated or undertreated conditions.","Our people are also on-site in hospitals, helping with discharge and follow-up care planning. They are in physicians' offices helping address gaps in care and documenting Medicare quality compliance. And they are on the phone and on the web treating every interaction as an opportunity to add value for the consumer by helping them understand the actions they need to take to improve their health.","You can see the benefit programs in approaches like these in our results. Growth in local commercial markets, where our efforts to be more local are having a positive effect, distinguished and ongoing growth in service to large self-funded employers who are among the most informed and discriminating in assessing service, quality, innovation and total value. Consistent Medicaid awards from States which focused on elements of quality, service, and total value in their valuation process. In just the past few weeks, we have been honored to be selected by the State of Michigan and the State of Texas for program expansions, and we recently finalized our commitments to serve the [state of IOLA] as a culmination of their award process.","And our Medicare stars quality is sharply higher for 2016 and 2017. Thanks to our employees and the strong performance of the care providers who have worked collaboratively with us to better serve seniors. We believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace, profitably improving its market share as a direct result of the quality, consumer satisfaction, and total value we deliver.","Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Considering together both the positives and pressures of the first nine months of this year, we continued to expect our full year 2015 results will fall within the range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share, and we would remind you that that range absorbs $0.10 per share for Catamaran and compares favorably with our original outlook of $6 to $6.25 per share. We continue to expect a further lift in the rate of earnings per share growth in 2016. The range of street estimates for the next year it's quite wide and we expect to be within that range, but not surprisingly, we would begin in a more conservative posture or range as we have in prior years. We were the first specific questions on 2016 financial performance to December 1, when we host our Annual Investor Conference in New York.","Let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you, Dave. So Larry and Dave had given some sense for why we continue to be optimistic about our potential to deliver value, throughout the broad healthcare system and to grow. You heard some of our touch tones in their comments, relationships, built around for us collaboration and mutual respect for the challenges in delivering healthcare improving it, and making it simpler for the people involved. Innovation, developing products and processes that truly help people solve real problems, and then embedding and driving these ideas to scale quickly to improve the overall system. Quality measured by health consumers, physicians and other customers to find it and feel it. Responsive and compassionate service which goes in hand-in-hand with quality and defines peoples' healthcare experience, our aspiration is to serve others on their terms not ours.","Satisfaction and value which together capture how well you bring all these elements together to help people in differentiated ways. We believe executing well on these elements at scale with nearly 200,000 dedicated people pulling in the same direction will make a difference for those we serve and drive distinctive sustaining growth across our enterprise.","Thank you for your interest this morning. And now operator, can we now take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We ask you to limit to one question per person, so we can get to as many participants as possible. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Can you clarify a couple things, you said about the cost trend, that you said, cost trend would be at the lower end of the guidance range of 5% to 6%, then you said MLR would be above the mid-point of the guidance range. I assume that the difference there is the spend on Medicare star scores, can you talk about how much you're spending on Medicare star scores in the MLR component, and what exactly the impact there is to you guys?","Stephen Hemsley","Well, I don't think we're going to get quite that granular, but I think we can respond to that as kind of in themes and maybe between Dave and Dan.","Dave Wichmann","Sure. Pete, I think you are right that the cost trend commentary around the commercial cost trend to be on the lower end of the 5.5% to 6.5% range. The MLR is expected to be about the mid-point, and you're right it's because of the impact of spending more on Medicare stars, which is substantive in the quarter as well as for the full year. I think you saw the results of some of our earlier efforts in our 2017 funding year, and what we're really focused on right now is, making sure that we continue to improve upon that, so that the 2018 funding year is at that 80% four star or higher level across the board if not higher. We also have -- as you know, we have gone our government services mix quite a bit in our business, and that is across Medicaid, Medicare as we kind of group in the insurance exchange into that as well, and those things have a tendency based upon based mix to biased that MLR up just a bit as well.","Peter Costa","And how should we think about that going forward into 2016?","Dave Wichmann","Going forward in 2016, we continue to expect strong growth across all components of the UnitedHealthcare business as well as Optum, influencing the MLR, I think we'll see strikingly better performance on the insurance exchange business, not only because of expansion, but also because improvements in the overall MLR and operating cost structure of that program, so it's about both. I think you'll continue to see strong growth in both Medicare and Medicaid which will put some pressure on that as well, but I would expect this to continue to go nicely in those two categories as well.","Stephen Hemsley ","But growth in those categories, so growth in government programs, exchanges and so forth, even middle-market tend to come at slightly lower margin, so you're seeing that blend effect in these results.","Larry Renfro","And we'll spend more time with you on that at Investor Conference, Peter.","Peter Costa","Great. And just, did the underpayment of this quarter's impact this quarter at all?","Stephen Hemsley","No, they do not.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, maybe if I can just continue of the discussion on the ACA exchanges. Can you help us understand the elements make you confident that you're going get strikingly better? I think you said, performance on the ACA exchanges next year. I mean -- and maybe there is a good, maybe this is bad, I don't know, but you have these co-ops sailing the largest in the New York market, I assume that. You may take up a lot or you may want to take up a lot of membership from that and you have price increases. But it's unclear what the mix of membership is going to be next year with regard to health status. So can you just talk to that?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. Okay, I'll let Dan and Jeff kind of comment on it, Dan.","Dan Schumacher","Sure, Matt. Good morning.","Matthew Borsch","Good morning.","Dan Schumacher","So, with regard to the exchanges and some of the Dave's earlier comments, so in the first half year, this year, we got industry data that suggested that the underlying use of medical services in that population was high and higher than we thought, and the good news is we use that information as the foundation for our 2016 pricing. So we put in strong price increases. Average increases across the country are in the double-digits, and we also took steps to eliminate some products and reposition other products. So as we look at our exchange business for 2016, that really speaks to Dave's comments about why we expect to see very nice improvement year-over-year. As it relates to our 2015 experience and our own block of business and what we're seeing, in the first half of this year, we did not see much in the way of medical use, so we had much less used as members rolled on for the first four months of the year, and they started to connected to coverage and care and so forth, and we've seen an increase in that, and so why we're calling it out, we called it out in the context of mixed in the second quarter, in the third quarter we're calling it out more specifically because on the year we expect the individual exchange business to put pressure on the consolidated care ratio. However as Dave mentioned, we fully expect to perform within the range of the guidance we provided last December at the Investor Conference.","Matthew Borsch","Dan, thank you. That was great. I'll get off now, I know you have a lot of people.","Dan Schumacher","Thanks, Matt.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. Just a follow-up on the MA star investments. You know, talking about an overall MLR of this year is going to be above the mid-point. Every 10 basis points, as I know, $130 million, $140 million of investment on the full year, so I don't know, what that implies, but that seems like pretty big investment. So the two questions, one, are these sort of temporary in nature, are they just impacting '15, are we going to see this continue into 2016, i.e. could this be a possible tailwind for next year? And then, how do you think about the ROI? What are you measuring? Are you just measuring simply the bonus? You have the reimbursement improvements and how do we think about sort of the cost versus -- the investment versus the upside from these investments?","Larry Renfro","Sure. So I guess somewhat globally, I'd offer that the investments are significant and we have made that clear in the past, and our goal to really get 80% or better of our overall Medicare at four stars and above. There is also benefits associated with that because when you're achieving that level you have flexibility with benefits and the reimbursements are better, so there is a -- and we're probably fund any more of the investments and we're getting the benefits at this point in time given the fact we were somewhat coming from behind if you will in terms of the overall star performance. Dan or Steve, do you want to comment further.","Dan Schumacher","Josh to your question around, do we expect levels to maintain, yes, we do. We expect to make comfortable investments forward in our stars and quality performance. And as you saw in the '17 payment data, we saw nice progress. In the year, our performance for '15 is improving which will carry forward to improvement in 2018 performance, but beyond the stars outcome, we also have outcomes in terms of quality and performance underneath that, as you look at medical cost and so forth that contribute. So those are some of things living that play in and how we look at the balance between the cost and the return.","Stephen Hemsley","And given the look back nature of this market hasn't really seen our best performance in terms stars so we really haven't gotten the benefit part of that yet, Steve.","Steve Nelson","Okay. Josh, it's Steve Nelson. Good morning. Hey, just a little more color on the investments, so when people talk about the medical cost, you can think about things like provider incentives, annual care visits, impact of very specific programs like diabetic navigators, and in terms of diabetic programs for that population. In terms of administrative investment, it's around things like that embedded practice support. We have 2,000 clinicians that are focused on closing gaps of care locally, and then we aren't orienting our organization like call centers to facilitate closure of gaps and getting people to the right care. So these are all paying great dividends for our members. We have 1.7 million members that are in improved plans of -- it's a great progress, but as Steve and Dave have both noted, we're not done. With the progress, we're not satisfied and look to improve on that, our 2018 theme here to at least 80% of the members in the four star plans or higher.","Josh Raskin","And just a follow-up, does that translate into above market level MA growth rates for you guys? You've been growing sort of -- let's call it in line with market this year. Should we think '16 and maybe more or so in '17 and '18 that you start growing faster than the overall MA market?","Stephen Hemsley","I think that would our hope. If you sit back and send a return on investment, I think this is a vital program. We think it has great growth potential in terms of the demographics as well as the orientation of Medicare itself to be more towards Medicare advantage, so this gives us opportunities with respect to benefits and I think it should translate to greater growth and that's why we're making those investments here.","Josh Raskin","Alright, thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. SG&A was a bright point in the quarter came in better than consensus expectation. And now that Catamaran is closed, how should we think about run rate SG&A, I think guidance was pre-Catamaran at 17% plus or minus 30 basis points?","Larry Renfro","Well, we are always managing our SG&A as tightly and appropriately as possible, but we're also making investments that are often embedded in SG&A investments in terms of some integration of the businesses as well as things that Dave mentioned such as Link and elements such as [indiscernible]. Do you want to start?","Dave Wichmann","Sure. Sarah, you're right that the Catamaran was probably the most significant influence on the care ratio in the quarter. We also had to increase productivity impacts on that as well, and then it's offset somewhat by the business mix as you can see from the growth from Optum as well as in our fee base programs, and there is a little bit of an insurer fee offset as well. We do expect Catamaran overall had pulled down that ratio by somewhere around 180 basis points or so in the quarter, so we would expect that kind of a trend to continue as it relates to Catamaran, but we would continue to expect some offset of that related to continued high growth in our services business over time.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities U.S.","Sheryl Skolnick","Thanks very much. And once again nice, very nice job on navigating through the various sundry challenges. One of the things that intrigued me was the commentary about the opportunity being both domestic and international. And if I read your press release correctly, it looks like your healthcare global which we don't focus on all that much has actually a nice year-over-year growth rate. So in the context of great change occurring not only U.S. in terms of payment methods and industry structure, but also overseas in Europe for example. I'm wondering, if we'd likely to see some renewed interest in that given that your [mill] experiment has now got some time under it. And your thoughts on the potential for international to be a new growth area or expanded growth area for United.","Stephen Hemsley","It's a great question and we clearly are focused on international and the opportunities to really bring principally services to [bear] there. Larry, do you want to take it?","Larry Renfro","Hey, Sheryl. Let me start by saying, if you look to add the way that we're positioning ourselves and -- I think I mentioned this earlier the five, what I'll call future growth area as you'd find international, and you will also find that international pretty much wrap around most of the products that we offer in the state. We obviously are working in Brazil to support a mill, and we have people on the ground, and we're building the Optum presence there, and that's going extremely well. We're starting to really take a look, and I think I can talk about it somewhat at the U.K. We've been there for a while, but at this point time, we're trying to look at some of the things that we've done with Optum360, and how that is working in the States, and a lot of the challenges that are being experienced in the U.K., we seem to be setting a pretty good spot to at least assess and have conversations and try to determine you know if we fit, so it's early innings in terms of these discussions and what we're trying to do, but we do see a future there. And we think that some of the experience we had in healthcare.gov will actually apply, and so we're kind of off and running at this point in time.","Stephen Hemsley","I think it's fair to say that even the best healthcare systems are interested in using information, developing better measures to improve quality and performance in those really are a sweet spot for Optum. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael Baker","Yes, thanks a lot. Given that we're in unprecedented time on the M&A front, I was wondering, if you could point to any tangible benefits that you've seen so far or what you would expect to see as the process of review continues?","Stephen Hemsley","As we kind of intimated in our last teleconference with you, we really are not going to comment on the transactions of others. I would say, they're going through, I'm presenting, a regulatory review process, and so we haven't really seen any real activity in the marketplace that we could offer any commentary on.","Michael Baker","Alright, thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","And we'll next to David Windley with Jefferies.","David Windley","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wondered if you would be willing to comment on the client reaction that you have observed or experienced since the Catamaran closure or in and around the Catamaran closure. What has been your retention rate or just kind of sense of retention there? And then secondly, also with Catamaran are you commenting or willing to comment on the reset to your long-term margin goals with the change in mix that Catamaran brings into Optum? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. I think it's a pretty positive story. Do you want to start, Larry?","Larry Renfro","Sure. Well, I thought that I'll start and then I'm going to hand it off to Mark too because he is dealing with this on a day-to-day. What I would say is, we believe that -- our message is resonating with our client. Now we do have very sophisticated knowledgeable and successful clients, and that's actually a positive, and as we have really gone out discussed our value proposition, really talking about enhanced services, talking about operational efficiency, purchasing scale as well as synchronization. I think across the board, we're really feeling pretty good and think we have started off with a solid, solid start. So Mark maybe some comments?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah. Thanks Larry. David, good morning. Well, we spent the last 90 days on an airplane. And as Larry and I've visited really all our largest clients as you'd expect, and that includes health plans, employers. We visited the consultant marketplace. And I have to tell you the reaction has been universally positive. I mean our clients like the scale of this combination. They like the fact that we've had a 10-year relationship and that really basically represent no conversion risk in terms of platform conversion. They especially liked the fact that we've got a very expanded service offering with the full suite of Optum services and many of them have been looking at and in fact buying those services along the way anyway, and so I like the fact that we've got a good team and the same teams in place and we continue to take care of them and obviously they are liking our value proposition, so we're feeling pretty good about client reactions. And I'd say overall my early read is things are looking good. I'll just go on to say that, the integration work is off and running, and the first 90 days have been very [crisp], we're off to a good start in bolting these businesses together.","David Windley","Very good. Thank you. And does this change your margin, Larry, your margin goal long-term?","Larry Renfro","Maybe I could offer a perspective on that. With a portfolio of margins across the expanse of our total business, and so different products and services will actually drive different margins and appropriately. So we have some businesses that are strong double-digits and we have businesses that are low single-digits and we're looking to drive and expand margin, but do it in appropriate ways -- appropriate ways meaning, we're driving value and consistency, we're driving productivity that doesn't really compromise service and so forth. So as these elements come into our total portfolio across UnitedHealth Group, they are certainly going to change the mix of that margin, but in total, we're driving towards appropriately expanding margins, and so as these elements come in they are just going to change the mix, they are not really going to influence the performance of the business.","David Windley","Okay, thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next please.","Operator","We'll go to Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker","Thanks. So I appreciate you on the first specifics on 2016 financial performance at the Analyst Day, but you've already mentioned several, sounds like to, tailwinds including Medicare and exchanges for next year, so maybe if you could just discuss in summary of these broad headwinds and any tailwinds for 2016. That would be helpful. Thank you.","Dave Wichmann","Sure. We look at some things that we sit back and -- when you really do the pluses and minuses of it, some of the things that are headwinds now turned to be tailwinds, and new of versions of them appears headwinds. So for example, I think, our year one market -- for our year one markets for exchanges will actually be a positive for next year, but we are moving them to 11 new markets, and so we will have to see how those markets will play out. I think our advances in stars is a positive, but as Steve indicated, we have clear aspirations, ambitions to improve our stars performance, so that we will continue to be working on that level as well.","Stephen Hemsley","I think OptumRx will have integration benefits, but they will also have integration costs, so I think those kinds of things start to play out. I think our Brazil performance is strengthening, but that markets stability is something we're watching closely. I think there will be some -- we are getting nice growth in List and Medicaid and we have some new successes there, but we are going to have to implement them and just given the total performance, we seeing rate pressures across Medicaid. So we try to take somewhat measured look as we kind of set our outlook for next year that we have a portfolio of these pluses and minuses, but in total we very much like where our business is in the growing capabilities. The deployment across the expanse of the markets tend to even out these pluses and minuses, so we're pretty optimistic about next year, and as Dave indicated, we're looking to accelerate our earnings growth rate.","Andy Schenker","Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next.","Operator","And we'll go to Chris Ray with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Ray","Hey, good morning. Just wondering, can you give us a sense for how Catamaran impacted the quarter whether it was dilutive, accretive, neutral, and then just some specifics around the integration costs in what the intangible amortization related to the [indiscernible] in the quarter? Thanks.","Dave Wichmann","So Catamaran contributed nicely to the quarter to achieve what expectations we had for it and similarly the cost associated with initial integration activities were consistent with what our expectations were as well. Maybe I can give you specifics about how it contributed, the one thing that we did do, is we suspended our share repurchase, so that had a negative effect, and for the full year as we indicated earlier, we expect that would cost us about $0.10 a share all in, but we were able to manage to overcome that and retain -- and continue to advance our guidance as well. In terms of the increased levels of amortization, it's about somewhere around $0.20 a year, think about it in that context, and we're on a base of about a run rate of UnitedHealth Group somewhere around $0.34 a year, so combined, maybe thinking after 2016, our run rate basis around $0.54 of amortization for year.","Chris Ray","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Yes, thanks. Maybe following up on a little bit on that last question. Two things on the buyback upfront obviously, you'd laid out a plant with Catamaran, is there any update on that plant [indiscernible] related to next year and there is a volatility of the markets sway that in any way you think is better opportunities, so there may be a quick way to come back and buy stock more aggressively, and then just with the comment on the amortization, there will be a bigger disparity with these pending deals complete on the year reporting GAAP, EPS and everyone else reporting cash EPS, any thoughts about that and maybe changing that?","Dave Wichmann","Sure. So, Dan, maybe you want to take the first one, I'll take second.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. On the buyback front, what we'd indicated is that that would reduce the level of buybacks for about 18 months or so, and we expect to continue to maintain that reduced level through the end of next year, think about it. And our target is to get somewhere around 40% liquidity ratio, that's not hard and fast, of course, we're going to continue to pursue M&A opportunities and of course if we would need to step up our share repurchase activities because of some kind of market events or otherwise, I think we have the flexibility to do so. So there is nothing kind of hard and fast about the way in which we operate that we manage our capital structure effectively over time.","Stephen Hemsley","But we're generally on a course towards a 40% total debt to total cap rate.","Dan Schumacher","And then in terms of the kind of supplemental [indiscernible] earnings, I think will address that at the Investor Conference coming up and we'll likely begin to provide the supplemental information with respect to how we would perform on both basis. ","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great, thanks. So I don't know whether I'm just spoiled or what, but you guys mentioned how you beat number and [raise] guidance a few times earlier this year. So I was a little bit surprised that there wasn't more upside in the quarter or around the guidance? And I understand the dynamics around high exchange MLR and stars investment, but these are things that you largely would have anticipated probably at the beginning of the year in a very least, when you reported Q2 results and provided a guidance back then, so I'm just trying to figure out, if there is something that you would point to that didn't quite work out the way that you were thinking heading into Q3 report or some of that, that you're worried about into Q4? I personally keep coming back to trend because you start out with -- I know you guys provided guidance, [I assume] kind of rise back to normal, so you startup providing guidance, then you are at the lower end of the range and now you're reiterating at the lower end of the range, so does that imply that trend is in fact rising, has it gone through the year because that combined with the lack of it into your development makes me wonder if there is something underneath there. So I guess answer that specifically and if I'm embarking up the longer tree, if there is anything else you might highlight as a headwind.","Stephen Hemsley","Well, again I might respond fanatically. First of all, I think if you take a look at our year-to-date performance, it actually is a pretty solid performance, [indiscernible] top line growth and strong translation of that to bottom-line performance. I think we maintain a healthy respect for medical cost trends, and I think as we indicated before, the medical costs within our expectations. Our patient continues to be strong and robust and growing. Specialty pharma continues to be strong. We haven't really talked much about that this morning, but none of those things have gone away, so we remain respectful of medical costs, and also the fact that they have been moderate for quite some time, and I don't know if you can assume, we do not assume for pricing that they will stay that way. I think as Dan indicated, as we got into the exchanges have we were thoughtful about making sure that as we price for next year that we used kind of the broader industry experience as opposed to our own because we really had a pretty favorable experience in the first half of the year in terms of the exchanges and they have matured kind of more in line with the industry. Is that right, Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Yes. I think that's fair.","Stephen Hemsley","Because you might point to that and you know continuing to be watchful of that. We continue to make investments in -- so Medicare stars is a look back process, so really the results that you're seeing are really the results of prior periods and we have intensified our efforts to make sure that we are really going to be a market leader with respect to stars, that's what we had indicated before, so we continue to make investments there in things like that, and we're going to continue that. Things like that, we mentioned, Medicaid and Medicaid expansions, continued rate pressures there, so I think we have to be respectful of all those elements in and the strong performance we're achieving, and then I think that's why we're kind of measured with respect to keeping our outlook the same and being serious about a range when we do, but also being very optimistic about where we see our business in the fact that we expect to grow even more strongly than we did this year. So I just think it's being measured and trying to be responsible about all the elements that play into our business","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, so that makes sense. You're being conservative, you're still optimistic. I guess, one, I don't know, way to clarification. So I think last quarter, you talked about, how you thought the United's earnings might accelerate on a core basis. Is that still the message, that you're giving now? You'd mentioned a lot of puts and takes earlier on. I just wasn't sure if they all sum up to the core business is accelerating over the last changed at all?","Dave Wichmann","Yeah, we did and we basically very much said that and said that in terms as we're expecting our earnings per share and so forth to grow at a fast rate next year than this year.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.","Sean Wieland","Thank you very much. So my question is on ICD10, was it a headwind or a tailwind in the quarter for Optum? And over the past couple weeks, have you seen any changes in denial rates? And then on a go forward basis what is ICD10 doing to your business in Optum?","Stephen Hemsley","So, Bill, do you want to comment that Bill Miller.","Bill Miller","Yeah, Sean. I'll talk to you on behalf for Optum. Particularly where a lot of those services sit in terms of helping health systems, payors go through the changes with respect ICD10 particularly on and understand we're in this for a few weeks here, but already we're seeing a certain uptake in a lot of our services and a lot of our products and a lot of our content as the market is preparing and now acting in response to the changes, and so there is some seasonality in the back half of our business, and it's being enhanced. I think we can see that in the numbers in terms of the uptake of our content in the back half of the year. So overall, from a services perspective, delivering value to the clients, ICD10 has been a lift for Optum across the board.","Stephen Hemsley","Dirk, do you want to comment on the [indiscernible] question?","Dirk McMahon","Yeah, sure. You know from an operational standpoint, overall the implementation is going pretty smoothly, but what I caution is they were only 15 days into that. Having said that, we spend years, getting our systems ready, working them with the provider community to ensure success. The overwhelming majority providers in the marketplace are submitting claims consistent with the ICD10 requirements. Our claim submission rate so far consistent with expectations, and for those limited number of providers we're having difficulty. We're able to identify [them] and get after them quickly, so that they submit consistent with requirements, so far so good.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question, please.","Sean Wieland","Thank you.","Operator","And next one would be Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hey, good morning. Thank you. Actually, just two quick ones. First, would you guys quantify where you health exchange enrolment is today?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. Dan?","Dan Schumacher","550,000 lives.","Gary Taylor","Okay. And the 11 new markets for next year, I guess we don't know what markets those are or the size. Can you give us a sense of magnitude of -- you get the same sort of share, what type of growth that might have on the 550,000?","Dan Schumacher","We're not really giving guidance out for next year until our Investor Conference, so I really wouldn't want to kind of shoot from the hip on this. We do expect -- we'll grow and we've taken some of the learning from this year as we have kind of entered those markets, but I think we're going to save guidance with respect to specifics on next year for our Investor Conference.","Gary Taylor","Okay, great. One more quick one, if I could. When we look at your statutory filings through the first half and understanding all the vagaries and nuances, we do see a very compelling trend in the commercial business, that I think ties with your comments around the commercial cost trend expecting to be lower end of that trend, but it did look like Medicare and Medicaid MLRs deteriorated somewhat in the 2Q. So I don't know if you'd be willing to offer any specific commentary on the product basis?","Stephen Hemsley","Dan, I don't know, if you can comment on it.","Dan Schumacher","I would tell you that, there are meaningful differences between our GAAP financials and our statutory financials and now how those get reported and how they flow through over time. So from my perspective, I wouldn't read through anything on statutory statements specifically.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next will be [Ralph Jacoby with Citi].","Ralph Jacoby","Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the stars spending, I guess when did that spending star, was it disproportionate and I guess to the third quarter. And your commentary about it sort of sustaining, I guess, into next year. Is it sort of the level off or could it be lower where the initial spend is higher in this quarter, having more sort of magnified impact. And then I guess, why not quantify this spend in that area to sort of help on kind of understanding more of 'core', and then similar sort of your last answer to the question, maybe even directionally, can you help us think about MLR trends by end market? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Dan, do you want to comment?","Dan Schumacher","Sure, Ralph. On the star spend, I would tell you that we have been making investments. We really started in the 2014 timeframe in the middle of that year, and then we have increased that in 2015. And I would tell you, in the relationship between the second and the third quarter as an example. So we put programs in place and what we had mentioned is that, we've seen an acceleration in the take up, so we had the programs in place, we had an expected outcome for it, and frankly we're having more people that are accepting house calls that are getting annual care business as Steve Nelson mentioned. And part of that's due to our service model, so we've been taking that interaction point and really trying to leverage it and help facilitate connecting people to care, and that's showing up, and also we have member and provider incentives and those burn into the market, we're seeing the take up rates on those increase. So we have spending in '14, we increased it in '15 and we have seen an acceleration in the take up rate as we moved from the first half into the second half of the year.","In terms of the sizing maybe one way to help orient your thinking around it, as you'd looked at our consolidated medical care ratio on a year-over-year basis. There is a couple of things that contributed to that. You can obviously see the change in development as one element, stars and quality investment is another element, and mix as a third is kind of the three principal drivers. And in terms of the share in contribution to it within a reasonable range on each of those, so that gives you some sense for the kind of sizing on it. And we expect the investments to carry into 2016 and we're seeing nice progress on our performance in 2015 which will lend itself to better star outcomes for 2018 payment year. And on exchange steps your blunt commentary.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","And we'll next to Ana Gupte with Leerink.","Ana Gupte","Thanks for taking my question, good morning. I was wondering what the directional trends were for the commercial [launch] ratio this quarter? I know you see utilization [indiscernible] which is great, but when you combine that with the overall pricing environment and then the balancing out with mixture of things small group exchanges and the likes?","Stephen Hemsley","Dan, Jeff?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. As you look at care ratios, Ana, in the quarter, we saw an increase in our care ratios, in our principle health benefits businesses, so our Medicare, Medicaid and commercial, and then offsetting that as we talked about kind of the full year theme in the Investor Conference. We're seeing improvement in international offsetting that sound, so directionally up.","Ana Gupte","And then going into 2016, as you say, some of the headwinds [get turned] and become tailwinds. What does this look like from a pricing perspective specifically overall? And then in the New York market, their small group definition is now being changed to only 50 and below, how does that impacted? And also finally with [indiscernible] not being fully reimbursed, [indiscernible], do you see a better pricing environment with plans that could have lost money like the blues or [lots of profit]?","Stephen Hemsley","I think it's a couple minutes to sort out that four dimensional question, but Jeff, do you want it?","Jeff Alter","Hey, Ana, it's Jeff Alter, good morning. I'll try to answer it in a sort of general term. We said last quarter, and I think we see it continuing, the market is firming a little bit on pricing. For our pricing in '16 as Steve said, we are respectful of the slow trend environment, perhaps changing. I think we took very prudent actions in the pricing that we have for our individual exchanges for '16 as Dan mentioned. We have not changed our forward pricing philosophy. We are very discipline about that, but also respectful of trending outpatient, specialty drugs, new drugs coming to market. So our pricing, I think is strong for '16. New York market, kind of your question around 2250 to 299 New York will be a 2299 market as well a couple other states. We have assumed, our thoughts for our growing growth for the rest of this year and for next year that there would be some transitional relief, so that the change last week really isn't much of the surprise to us because we're already preparing for a large part to that market to go through some transitional [relief], so our pricing in '16 is in alignment with the change in the law last week.","Ana Gupte","Alright. Thanks so much.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please. We'll take maybe two more.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold","Hey there. I'd like to put the focus a little bit to Optum. You said that you were seeing some interest in innovative services by Federal Government, and this seems like a pretty big opportunity as well as in some international markets. It's always struck me that the fee-for-service Medicare program doesn't have a lot and we have care coordination and from the other things that Optum provides, might there be an interest in that in terms of the Optum capabilities, the fee-for-service Medicare population. And if not, I'm thinking about that incorrectly, how should I be thinking about that?","Stephen Hemsley","Larry, you want to comment?","Larry Renfro","Christine, I think you're spot on in terms of what we're trying to do with the Federal Government. And as you know, we've had some involvement with CMS in previous programs and so forth with where Optum has been involved on healthcare.gov. And as we are putting our programs together, we're constantly working with them and talking about the different services, the different data analytics, and it really pretty much everything that Optum has to offer. So your suggestion is a good one, one we know about and one that we're actually working on. You know these are large RFPs as you can imagine. We're pretty much aware of how they work and when they're going to be coming down the road, but I think we're fully engaged and understand what we need to do, and we're better positioned today than we might have been in the past because of the situation that we had with healthcare.gov, we kind of stepped out of that now, and that was one of the reasons that we did it, so we would play in more of the RFPs.","Stephen Hemsley","But Medicare would be a department of the Federal Employee Benefit Plan, State Programs, and then Larry commented on kind of the international versions of all of the above. I think all those are going to the areas that are going to try to improve performance, and that Optum is perfectly positioned for that.","Christine Arnold","And with respect to timing, should we be thinking about that as something we see in the next year or is this something that takes five years? I just don't have good sense for your workings of the government.","Dave Wichmann","I think that some of the areas that Steve just talked about, there is different timing, there is some that's deal within the next, I would six months, but some of them could go out two years, so it's a variety of situations. When the RFPs are [due], but as I would comment on it, I think I kind of said is, we have a lot of people, we don't have an organization, it's dedicated to the government business Dr. Steve said, whether it would be state or federal, and it could also include the VA and what we're doing DoD, so it's not just like a set time that I could give you, but I would say that, if we looked at our qualified pipeline in terms of how we're looking at the business that is somewhere we're staying around $20 billion and a substantial piece of that would fall in the government business.","Christine Arnold","Great. Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","One last question please.","Operator","And our final question comes from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Tom Carroll","Hey guys, good morning. So do you believe that the market and particularly large self-insured employers perhaps will give United a stronger look than usual if there is such a thing in 2016 as your large competitors are involved in some pretty sizable M&A?","Stephen Hemsley","Well, I would hope they would give us a look because of the values that we deliver and the quality and consistency of our services and the breadth of the things that we bring. And I would say also the innovative dynamic, we are well-known for being in the forefront of innovation. And we have really compelling cost structures and probably deeper into in more diverse and care management to the commentary this morning. So I would hope that they would be looking at us for those elements, and then good if they're concerned about other dynamics in the marketplace I can't comment on that, but I would hope it is for the former and so I would kind of leave it at that. I do think the marketplace will be strong and robust in the next couple years. Jeff, do you agree?","Jeff Alter","Yes, Steve. Just reminder, we already served an overwhelming majority of that marketplace and I think the value that Steve described is seen by those clients today and we hope that that reputation continues to help us grow into the marketplace that we don't currently in.","Dave Wichmann","I think we're looking at a strong national outlook for next year.","Stephen Hemsley","As we mentioned in the last call, our '16 national account season has progressed very nicely towards the end right now, and we'd see a better '16 season in '15, which was better than '14, so the momentum and trajectory is something that we're very pleased with.","Tom Carroll","Great. Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","So thank you. We are pleased to have delivered good performance year-to-date. We'll continue to improve the quality of our products and services as our last commentary. And we remain optimistic about 2016, and look forward to sharing more information with you about the future of UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare at our Investor Conference on December 1. So thank you for your attention today.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"21146":["UnitedHealth Group Inc.

Welcome to UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws.

A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 19, 2016, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning. Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line with the guidance provided at our December Investor Conference with fourth adjusted earnings per share at $1.40 brining full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share to $6.45. Overall UnitedHealthcare had a positive year and finished with strong fourth quarter growth exceeding 300,000 members and growing across all its markets.","Optum delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter with revenues up 70% and earnings up 46% over the prior year. Before we go into the business commentary, let me offer a brief recap of 2015.","2015 UnitedHealth Group revenue grew more than 20% to $157 billion with organic revenue growth of 10%. Our cash flows were exceptional at $9.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Our dividend increased 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share this year. United Healthcare grew to serve more than 1.7 million more people domestically as Optum grew its revenues by 42% and revenue backlog by more than 20%.","Excluding the impact of individual exchange compliant products and reserves related to the initiation of a new Medicaid contract, UnitedHealth Group still grew revenues by 19% in 2015 and grew operating earnings 15% to $11.8 billion and that would have produced an adjusted earnings per share of $7, a 16% year-over-year increase again absent those items to give you an idea of the underlying strength of the enterprise.","We know the individual exchanges are top of mind to you and Dave Wichmann will discuss these fully in his comments. As we said at the investor conference, the balance of our total business to well more than a 175 billion of it is driving considerably stronger and better position than this time last year. We are committed to delivering a strong 2016 performance year in growth, in financial results and in the quality of our services and net promoter score or NPS performance metrics.","2016 is off to a strong start considerably stronger than 2015. Our initial growth trends are very encouraging and our service performance for new January business is strong. Optum\u2019s revenue backlog and pipelines have never been stronger. Medical cost in the fourth quarter trended slightly better than expected and we are confident, our benefit businesses have appropriately priced our products for 2016.","Our operating business platforms drive these results, so I will ask Larry Renfro to review Optum\u2019s performance for full year 2015 and Dave Wichmann to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide some UnitedHealth Group enterprise live comments. Larry?","Larry Renfro","Thanks Steve . 2015 was without question an exceptional performance year for Optum in revenues and earnings growth. And then our preparations to setup 2016 to deliver well for the nearly 115 million people we serve.","Optum\u2019s businesses have strong momentum and are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. Since beginning the one Optum journey in 2011, we have compounded revenues at 23% per year and operating earnings at 34% per year.","In 2015, Optum\u2019s revenues of $67.6 billion grew 42%, including organic revenue growth of 13%. OptumRx revenues grew 51% this past year to $48 billion and even excluding the Catamaran combination posted solid double digit organic growth. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to more than $20 billion which is growth of 24% over 2014.","Our full year operating margin of 6.3% reflects the increase mix of pharmacy care services revenues drive by OptumRx organic growth in five months of Catamaran business. Both OptumHealth and OptumInsight strong full year 2015 margins are sustainable and we project operating margin expansion for OptumRx in 2016.","In 2015, we added to our strategic relationship portfolio which now numbers 10 and we\u2019ve remained focused on developing more of those comprehensive large scale relationships. They leverage Optum\u2019s unique end-to-end capabilities to help solve the broader challenges, customers and prospects are facing in a changing healthcare environment whether they are physicians or hospitals, health benefit sponsors, governments or consumers.","To illustrate, consider our Optum360 revenue management relationship with Dignity Health where cash flows have already improved by $1.5 billion and accounts are being settled before eight days faster and where are documentation technology is helping Dignity Health physicians meet demanding ICD10 requirements even as they are realizing a 50% gain in productivity. Our consider OptumCare, our expanding care delivery business in which we are developing some of the most impactful and durable consumer relationships. Today, we serve seven million patients to more than a 150 payer relationships across our physician practices, our community based clinical services and our MedExpress neighborhood care centers.","MedExpress operates at the conversions of healthcare and retail measuring success one patient at a time. MedExpress can provide as much as 90% of the care patients receive in the ER and for as little as 10% of the cost. MedExpress mitigates cost for both payers and consumers while providing high quality convenient care.","We currently operate over a 160 neighborhood care centers with a goal of operating several multiples of that number five years from now. Today there are OptumCare clinics in more than 270 locations in 26 local markets having recently added pro health in the Connecticut market to that distinctive high performance practice portfolio.","Our pipeline for growth is gaining momentum as well. The OptumCare approach, we expect local market norms and expectations and our doctors consistently deliver a high quality results for the communities they serve. We consistently outperform benchmarks around the acute care readmissions and skilled nursing facility stays. More than three quarters of private Medicare patients we care for are in health plans rates four starts or better and more than 96% of our patients would recommend our local care provider office to workers.","For patients with complex medical conditions, our integrated care model has proven distinctive results. We deliver on average a 50% reduction in overall healthcare cost for medically complex patients with very high patient and family satisfaction. A number of OptumCare\u2019s high performing practices have been nationally recognized for their performance and council care initiatives including Monarch in Southern California and ProHEALTH in New York metro area.","And finally, our healthcare services continued to deliver clear and distinctive value for Medicare recipients and payers with 98% patient satisfaction and more than one million visits to patients in their homes delivered in 2015 and further growth in 2016.","With the market momentum we have today and through these constantly advancing capabilities, we expect OptumCare will remain a high growth business for many years to come. As we care other examples in future quarters that reflect Optum\u2019s growing diversification such as our military and veteran\u2019s health services or our pharmacy care services or our technology support services, you should say with even more clarity a pattern immerging. The application of data, technology and services to bring better performance helping health systems work better for everyone.","Today revenues from our top 25 customer relationships at Optum have quite rubbled over the last three years. In 2015, the average customer awards has doubled across OptumHealth and OptumInsight and we expect continued strong customer retention at OptumRx, we work to bring the powerful benefits of the OptumRx merger to these clients. Common health organizations continued to enquire about how our capabilities can help them, so we are exploring potentially large and interesting new strategic relationships. In many cases, these parings could further accelerate growth in the OptumInsight backlog which now exceeds $10.4 billion and grew by more than 20% year-over-year.","Within the current portion of that backlog, we already cover more than 80% of OptumInsight\u2019s full year projected 2016 revenues. We remain optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. For 2016, we are projecting revenues to well exceed $80 billion which would be growth in the area of 20% and for operating earnings to grow 30% to 34% to more than $5.55 billion.","Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and now represents about 42% of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s consolidated operating earnings outlook.","Now let me turn it over to Dave.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value and the result is strong, sustainable growth.","UnitedHealthcare new serves 46.4 million medical members and we have leading market positions in all private health insurance segments of North and South America.","Over the past five years, we have grown by nearly 13.5 million people or 40% well diversified across commercial, government programs and international offerings. This reflects the delivery of diversification and consisting competiveness of our offerings globally.","UnitedHealthcare continued to strength in 2015 growing to serve 1.75 million more people domestically as they continue to improve its market share. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s full year revenues grew nearly 10% to $131.3 billion. The full year operating margins of 5.1% decreased as expected declining 70 basis points year-over-year due to the effects of public insurance exchange products. Full year commercial medical cost trends of 5.5% came in at a low end of our initial outlook one year ago. Our cost trends reflect a positive, sustainable impact of higher consumer engagement, strong alignment of incentives with care professionals grew value based relationships and improving data collection and application.","We are equally pleased with immerging innovation trends in our business focused on advancing the consumer movement in healthcare. Today 25 million consumers are served through our Advocate4Me service model. People served by this innovative approach are more engaged in their health and are more effective in their healthcare decision making and are more satisfied.","Today over 23 million consumers have joined our Rally Digital Health applications and we are seeing steady advances in daily active use of these services. Including importantly engagement around selecting primary care physicians better used of urging care over emergency care, screenings and higher adoption of personal health and condition management programs. And today, our Real Appeal digital medical service designed to help manage weight and reduce the onset of diabetes has been deployed to accounts representing one million people in just the last half of 2015 and with an additional half million committed for the first half of 2016.","The initial results are encouraging with 46% of participants achieving a meaningful reduction of 5% or more of their body weight within 16 weeks. 5% weight loss reduces the conversion to diabetes by nearly 60% according to studies conducted by the Nation Institutive Health. Give these exceptional results, we plan to make available digitally a broader set of preventative medical services to engage people to live healthier lives to the fullest.","Across UnitedHealthcare, we intend to continue to positively impact the quality of social services, condition management, cost and quality transparency, convenient care, wellness and the overall quality of life of the consumers we serve by giving them the tools like these to engage them in their health.","Our work is improving the quality of patient care. In Medicare, we help close 9 million gaps in care for the seniors we serve. We will serve 1.7 million members in health plans with higher star ratings in 2017 as we expect at least 63% of our members to be in a four star plan and we will further improve that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more.","It is not a coincidence we are off to our strongest growth start for Medicare Advantage in company history. We expect to close first quarter with growth of around 300,000 seniors and Medicare Advantage and we are tracking well against our full year outlook of 325,000 to 400,000 people in that growth.","In commercial benefits, we combine cheered networks, our clinical strategies, an innovative product designs in ways to align to a wider rate of affordable price points for employers and consumers. Today one third of our commercial customers are served through one of these more affordable plan offerings. That\u2019s double the number from five years ago. And we expect that percentage to more than double again over the next five years aiding to our exceptional growth.","In Medicaid, over the past two years, we are secured new contract awards totaling more than 2 million people. Manage Medicaid continues to immerge as the ultimate long terms sustaining solution for states and we believe UnitedHealthcare offers our state customers the most distinctive and comprehensive set of capabilities.","Like in Medicare and commercial, we are well positioned for 2016 growth in community and state.","Turning to exchanges, we expect to start the year at around 700,000 or fewer public exchange members and expect these numbers will steadily decline over the course of the year. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance over the balance of 2016. We have withdrawn platinum products, increased prices, eliminated marketing and commissions, intensified clinical engagement and medical management with this membership group and reduced operating cost as appropriate.","As a matter of prudence, we have increased our premium deficiency reserve by $65 million above our Investor Conference estimates, bringing the total fourth quarter charge to $340 million. 245 million of that charge addresses 2016\u2019s exchange compliant product exposure. This is an addition to the unreserved losses including in our 2016 outlook combined more than $1.5 billion set aside for 2016. We believe we are fully captured 2016 exposure, now based on our actual starting enrollment. And by mid-2016, we will determine to what extend if any, we will continue to offer products in the exchange market in 2017.","In Medicaid, the start of the new program in Hawaii has been deferred while the state has also increased the assigned enrollment for each contracted plans which increases our estimate of revenues. We are in constructive discussions with the state concerning elements of an effective and sustainable managed Medicaid program to serve that market.","As we look into 2016 and 2017, we believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace and profitably improve its market share. Fundamentally UnitedHealthcare is emerging across the spectrum of consumer driven products, service, wellness, transparency and most important care engagement and clinical quality particularly in government programs.","We have room to improve but we sharp focused on NPS and the quality of the work we do in a cultured centered around helping others, we have an opportunity to offer even greater value to consumers, providers and customers are like in the coming years. Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole.","We are committed to strong performance in 2016 across UnitedHealthcare and Optum in service, in operations, in growth, in earnings generating and in cash flow production. We foresee cash flow is approaching $10 billion and adjusted net earnings of $7.60 to $7.80 per share. Again adjusted net earnings for us is GAAP EPS plus after tax intangible amortization. We encourage everyone to move to adjusted net earnings to enable better comparability among companies and among the analysts community. We expect about 46% to 47% of full year earnings in the first half of the year with Optum at approximately 40% of its full year plan in the first half exactly as you saw it last year and in the past. We expect the rate of our earnings growth to strengthen during 2016. Current consensus street estimates for first quarter adjusted earnings per share might be slightly strong compared to our expectations at the moment.","All in, we have a strong view of 2016 and look forward to this year. Steve?","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you, Dave. At our investor conference, we offered a sense of the growing innovation and entrepreneurial activity in our company and the restless drive, our team has to grow and improve performance. On the customer side, we are committed to further elevating satisfaction for consumers, care providers and all our stakeholders to levels more often seen outside our industries to better meet the increasing expectations people and society have for healthcare.","When our net promoters scores reflect people being staunch advocates for our products and businesses because of the way we make their simpler and the value we provide as they define and experience it as consumers and customers will be on the path creating truly distinctive and substantial growth and brand equity.","We believe a differentiated brand and reputation will drive accelerated growth in market share for our businesses for years to come. Our goal for serving you as investors in 2016 is simple. We are committed to delivering clean, strong results this year back by a growing pipeline of opportunities for 2017 and beyond. We expect distinguish revenue growth, earnings and cash flow in 2016 that continued to reflect the diversity, breath and overall strength of our enterprise and the valuable businesses we are building.","Thank you for your interest today. And operator, can we take some question this morning. One per analyst, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, hi, good morning. Could you just talk about what the factors were that caused you take increase your booking for anticipated losses in 2016. I guess maybe, I think it was 45 million higher on the exchange side and 20 million higher on the Medicaid contract, if I got that right?","Stephen Hemsley","Yes, you do. And it\u2019s really just purely updating and I think Dan Schumacher can take you through that.","Dan Schumacher","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Borsch","Good morning.","Dan Schumacher","So, you are right. We did increase our loss expectations for 2016. And when it came to really as we closed out the year, we took - we took a prudent past year on the \u201815 impact and then we carried that through to 2016 outlook and then we adjusted further for a little higher enrollment expectation for 2016, so those are the elements that played into the increase in both the \u201815 impact and the assumed losses for \u201816 in the individual exchange compliant plan offerings. And then with regard to the Medicaid potion, that\u2019s simple, just a function of a higher enrollment expectation as the number of carries was reduced from four down to three. But when you put that all together in total as we close the year, it was about a $100 million of impact beyond what our guidance had assumed from December and -","Matthew Borsch","Okay.","Dan Schumacher","So our base business, the vast majority of our business performed exceptionally well and we delivered fully in line with the expectations as we closed out \u201815. And then as we look to \u201816, we\u2019ve incorporated that again fully into our outlook as we reaffirm out guidance for \u201816.","Matthew Borsch","And if I could just one related question, in the four quarter on individual enrollment, I think your total book is about 1.2 million, how did that change as a result of the maybe in - at the end of the year and then coming into this year as a result of the coop insolvencies and related instability in the individual market?","Stephen Hemsley","So, and I think the last time we talked, we talked about our individual exchange compliant being about 700,000 of that 1.2 million you\u2019ve referenced. As we closed out the year, that came in at about 650,000 lines and then we\u2019ll expect that to grow as we step into January and then it will start to shrink again over the course of the year as some of those enrollment, and will these trade out.","Matthew Borsch","Okay, thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","And that we just say is kind of an overarching flats and our goal is in this area is to be careful conservative and to make sure that we really capture all this, so that we really do have the rest \u201816.","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Josh Raskin","Hi thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little about Medicare Advantage another CMS data is relatively preliminary but certainly seems like you guys are well on page to beat the 400,000 for the full year at the high end. So just curious, you know doesn\u2019t sound you got much star improvement this year, so what made your products more attractive, is it more retention, is it you know more agents or coming from other plans, just any color on where this is - where the growth is coming from?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. It is good growth as Dave indicated, but Steve Nelson can really respond to that and it is a very positive story.","Steve Nelson","Thanks Steve. Hi Josh, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. Yes, very positive about the growth that we are seeing coming through the AP and it\u2019s little inside into that growth. First, it\u2019s important to remember that it comes as a result of and after a couple year of really hard work as we repositioned this product to some of that change in Medicare Advantage program introduced premiums, created a more aligned engaged network and relationships with our providers and meaningful improvement in stars as you mentioned. And you know second, we really like where the growth is coming from and so I think Dave mentioned in his comments about 300,000 or so as a result of AP, about third of that comes from Group, so really inside into that pricing in that membership. And then within the individual business, meaningful improvement in our retention also has added to this growth.","And this is membership that you know we\u2019ve been engaged with and they\u2019ve been involved in our clinical programs. And it\u2019s very evenly spread across geography and products, but the stability of our products, the evolution of our portfolio is really resonating in the market. And so that\u2019s all contributes to the growth and we expect this as a Medicare Advantage product to continue to grow as we look to 2017 and beyond.","Josh Raskin","And Steve just a quick follow-up on that, do you have a percentage of how many are coming from previously not in MA whether that\u2019s agents or tradition people service versus how many are coming from other plans competing plans?","Steve Nelson","It\u2019s a little early to give that kind of color but I would say in general in terms of how we look at the membership, it\u2019s very much in line with our expectations.","Josh Raskin","Okay, thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andy Schenker","Hey, thanks. Maybe just going back to the exchange enrollment real quickly, just a few on the membership, maybe if you could talk a little bit about how your positioning or membership growth compared to the existing states versus the 11 new states you entered and then relates that obviously still a little over week left in enrollment, just how your - you know what kind of forecast you are expecting for total enrollment, I assume you are trying to - you assume there is a big jump in the last week or two but just how we should think about that you know 700,000 related to expectation last two weeks? Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Sure, good morning, Andy. So on the exchange enrollment specifically, the 700,000 as Dave mentioned beginning January, we ended the year with just about 500,000 so that jumped up to about 700,000 as of one-one. We\u2019d expect that over the balance of the open enrollment period to grow something underneath about - to about 800,000, something a little sound of that. And then we would expect that to where off as you pace through the year as those members trade out.","In terms of the where it\u2019s coming from, I would tell you that the net growth in coming with a greater orientation toward those new states as well as expansion areas but a little bit of mix of both.","Andy Schenker","Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Okay, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ray with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Chris Ray","Good morning. Thanks. Just on the last question, I got a little confused with the numbers, Dan just on the 800,000 versus 700,000, 500,000 ending the year and 650ish thousand now, can you just confirm, did you end the year 650,000 or was it 500,000?","And then my real question with regard to all of this, do you know how many the people that have currently signed up were enrolled with you guys last year versus new membership? Thanks a lot.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. So just to be clear, we ended - we ended the year with 650,000 lives in individual exchange compliant offerings, inside of that 500,000 of them were on exchange. So the balance 150,000 was off exchange. And then as we step into January that exchange component which ended the year about 500 grows to about 700 and then as you move towards the end of the open enrollment period, it grows further up towards 800,000 something sound of that and then works it straight down over the year. The off exchange is more level than what we experience in the on exchange.","And then to your last question about mix of enrollment, more than half of the enrollment is new to us and a little less than half of the enrollment is existing enrollment base.","Chris Ray","Right, thanks a lot.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you, next please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hi everybody. Just might ask, focus my question on Medicaid, both, do you update your membership with one player dropping out and eye was had enough move the needle, I guess we\u2019ve had some companies comment on concern about profitability in Medicaid year-to-year, can you give us a play over there? And then finally on that the health insure the question for 2017, if you got an clarity from CMS where as it relates to either Medicaid or Medicare and how they are going to treat that, those dates I guess?","Stephen Hemsley","That is quite an impressive single question A.J. so we\u2019ll break that up into pieces and we\u2019ll start with Austin on Medicaid.","Austin Pittman","Sure. So hey, A.J. this is Austin, how are you?","A.J. Rice","Good.","Austin Pittman","Right, so first of all, I think you\u2019re asking about Iowa. We did increase our membership outlook and assumptions for Iowa as the state moves from four players to three. As far as the sustainability, the program, I think first of all as we state of four, we are really honored to been selected to serve the people of Iowa. We continued to be - feel good about the relationship that we develop at the state. We\u2019re in very productive conversation with them about really tried in true methods to ensure long term stability. And so we feel good about where that\u2019s headed and it will become a long term and very durable part of our portfolio.","And with regard to the rates overall, as you know states are always pressured, there is nothing new in that. I think we are very pleased with our business, most pleased with the value that we\u2019ve been able bring the customers into the consumer over the years. We\u2019ve got a very strong management team, very locally deployed, enable to manage these populations and really help people in very vulnerable situations and then deliver value for the long term. So I think we feel good about pressured but stable rate environment and the growth in this market.","A.J. Rice","And that\u2019s been really distinctive in terms of the rate environments, the same pressures that exist every year.","Stephen Hemsley","Absolutely, yeah. Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. A.J. it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. On the health insurers tax, you know, we miss if I didn\u2019t mention that, from our perspective obviously the tax just increases the underlying cost of healthcare and as a result makes healthcare less affordable. So as we look at the elimination of it for 2017, we are certainly encouraged by that and frankly we\u2019ve been long support, you know that\u2019s permanent repeal. Now with that said, I\u2019ll tell you in terms of the impact, in Medicaid, we expected to be no impact. In the commercial business because that\u2019s prices on a policy year basis and the tax is living on a calendar year basis. There is no impact over three years but there are some differences by year and we expect it actually be a drag on our 2016 earnings. We\u2019ve estimated that impact to be about a $100 million pretax or about $0.06 earnings per share.","And then lastly the Medicare of business, the tax has not been part of the rate setting process previously, so we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be for 2017 either.","A.J. Rice","Okay.","Stephen Hemsley","That pressure is covered in our guidance. We basically observe that in our guidance given the strength of the start of the year. Next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. Just go back to the exchanges. I guess if we shift the premium does it from 2015 as of 2016, are you saying that you expect to lose more money on exchanges in 2016 than either in 2015 and if so why would that be the case I guess you had a chance to price up the core business?","Stephen Hemsley","Well, I\u2019ll have Dan answer this, but I think as a matter of prudence, what we are doing is making sure that we have covered ourselves appropriately in \u201816, so that means we set aside more money between the reserve that have set aside and what we have covered it within our guidance that it\u2019s clearly out purpose. We are really focused on making sure that this item is really covered at \u201816 and so I think that\u2019s what you should read through in terms of our activity. Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So if you move the premium deficiency reserve and reset the years and look at it, you know on the individual exchange compliant plans within \u201815, we launched about $475 million on the \u201815 policy year. And the \u201816 policy year as Dave Wichmann had mentioned, we\u2019ll lose more than $500 million. So, and we\u2019ve got about a 10% increase in the loss assumption balance against about a 25% to 30% growth assumption in the underlying enrollment base. And the reason that we\u2019re able to do that is to the points that you mentioned, obviously we came in with very strong pricing, you know that mid-double-digits. And further we\u2019ve made some strong refinements to our product portfolio, those are the largest contributors. But beyond that, we\u2019re also working every single data, the tuner operating environment as well as focus our clinical interventions in our network orientation around this population.","Kevin Fischbeck","I guess you are saying is the loss of be in - and then you mentioned like path that goes to be new states and new geographies, is that - is that why that the losses, is that why have loss is really at all going up or do you think that the core business is actually getting get worse as well?","Dan Schumacher","No, I think it\u2019s going up because we got enrollment growth and then balanced against that is our pricing, our product positioning, our clinical interventions, our operating environment and then improvements we\u2019re making there.","Stephen Hemsley","And I might point out that, this is what we are providing, we are being careful in terms of making sure that we\u2019ve covered this off. These are not losses that we are sustaining these are but we have protected ourselves against in terms of \u201816.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take the next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Costa","Thanks for the question. Previously you said that you are expecting $0.13 to $0.15 or 200 to 225 million of additional losses from the exchange business in 2016, it seems like that grew a little bit, and you talked about over half a billion now in losses including the $245 million PDR. But my question gets to you know if that\u2019s the right number, the $0.13 to $0.15 and maybe correct me if I am wrong, that would be you know say $0.14 at the midpoint added to your the midpoint of your 760 to 780 guidance, so let\u2019s call that $7.84 of potential earnings, that\u2019s only 12% growth from the $7 number that you have excluding those the individual business item, yet last year you grew 16% to get to that $7 in terms of earnings, which of your core businesses is the one responsible for the slowdown from 16% to 12%?","Stephen Hemsley","Well you know Peter, those are projected numbers. We would think that we could perform even more strongly. So I think that by just isolating that against a beginning of the year range may not be a fair comparison in comparing your 16 to 12. Actually as we take a look across our spectrum of businesses, we really don\u2019t see any of these businesses in a position that they are actually, I would say they are all stronger than they were as we - compared to this time last year as we entered clearly across the board in Optum. The strength of the portfolio from one end to the other has advanced. And in terms of UnitedHealthcare, I think all those businesses have strengthen the - and I think are positioning on the exchange has strengthen. So I think my view on this is that is a pretty positive outlook.","Peter Costa","The 15%, you are telling, the difference between the 16% and the 12% then it\u2019s PPD but perhaps is that what you would say?","Stephen Hemsley","No, I am not sure you can, it might be - take that one element and then project against estimated earnings range as we go out, we could be even stronger than that.","Peter Costa","Okay.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary Taylor","Hi good morning. This is question for Larry I think. When we look at Optum inside, operating income was up a $200 million sequentially, same case last year was up about a $100 million sequentially in the four quarter. Can you just remind us the source of the seasonality in the operating income for OptumInsight, please?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. I think we\u2019ll Larry kind of give you some sense of the growth of momentum there and then respond to that specific question.","Larry Renfro","Garry, it\u2019s Larry. I think that you\u2019ve seen over the last few years that the fourth quarter is obviously a dominant quarter for us that will stay that way. If I had to break it down, I\u2019ll give you three areas to think about. Lot of time since beginning of the year, we\u2019re making investments and those investments payoff in the fourth quarter and you see a little bit of that happening, we\u2019re also in implementation mode they are in the year and those implementation then installations also come true in the four quarter and that enables us to obviously have a stronger position at that point.","When you look at the products and services, there are specific products like obviously distribution that goes along with open enrolment but also our pay for performance and incentives will also hit in the fourth quarter. So we don\u2019t see that changing, we see that being the pattern that Optum in general will be experiencing.","Gary Taylor","Okay, thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold","Thank you. Impressive increase in backlog for OptumInsight, can you remind us if you gave us some parameters Investor Day, how to translate that into expected revenue overtime? Thanks.","John Rex","Sure. Christine, it\u2019s John Rex, good morning. Yeah, when you thing about the backlog $10.4 billion backlog you\u2019ve seen inside some of the guidance points that we provided on that. You should expect about 60% of that to be recognized in the 2016 revenues so that equates about 80% of the full year revenue outlook. Another way to look at that is that the average duration of the backlog runs about 20 months. And these are being fairly consistent numbers and I expect that could be fairly consistent as you look ahead also.","Larry Renfro","So Christine, it\u2019s Larry. One think I would add to what John said is that as of now about 90% of our 2016 revenue is locked in, obviously that\u2019s part of the backlog.","Christine Arnold","Okay, perfect, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James","Thank you. I just have one quick follow-up here before my question is, so you\u2019d mentioned earlier that there are conversations with States Medicaid rates are tried in true methods that insurance stability, is that mean, I am wondering this is referencing changes in the risk adjustment methodology that can redo some premium get backs or are you talking about our aspects of tried in two methods?","Austin Pittman","So, this is Austin. Really I was talking about a whole portfolio of method, so you can think about care coordination, network management, the level of transparency that we address, the rates and immerging experience overtime with States. And so you could narrow it down any one, we get a very long term history of 20 and 30 year relationship, so a lot of success in how we work with States and so that\u2019s what let us to feel so confident and comfortable with where we do with Iowa and really with our whole portfolio States.","Sarah James","Got it. And just I know some of your peers are trying to get those risk adjustment seems back, is that was an indication that United where those well but it sounds like based on other aspects that you are negotiating right?","Stephen Hemsley","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t comment any further in - any further detail about the specifics of any conversation with any State.","Sarah James","Got it. Then in the past you\u2019ve talked about opportunities for growth on Medicaid outside RFP cycle like States assigning our PSS or covering in other products, do you still see that as a possibility and is there anything near term?","Stephen Hemsley","So, let me comment on the pipeline overall which I think is very strong. You know States continue to move and look to managed care as solutions for their healthcare needs and that movement continues as States have really embraced this. I think that activity, in fact I think we expect to respond to over 20 RFPs this year that will be implemented in \u201816, \u201817 and on into \u201818. So again when I say the pipeline is strong, it\u2019s very strong. That\u2019s heavily weighted towards more complex population, so that\u2019s really what you are talking about when you speak to LTSS and the movement of those complex populations from fee for service and to managed Medicaid, we\u2019ve got one of the largest books business, in that space we\u2019ve got a very long history at dealing with these very vulnerable people and delivering real value to those individual, so - as well as value to the States.","So I think we feel and Dave mentioned it in the opening comments, I think uniquely positioned between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to really serve these populations and help them live healthier lives year-over-year and deliver value back to the States and the process. So I think our outlook for that continued movement even within States where we\u2019re already providing traditional tenant population managed care to continue grew into those complex populations.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho U.S.A.","Sheryl Skolnick","Thanks so much. First let me step back, I mean against the backdrop of a somewhat challenging situation that exchanges, let me in this stand fall complement everyone from UHC to Optum to senior management the way you performed and handled during 2015. I am impressed by especially the fact that somewhere I sit that privacy made with the cost structure as well as positioning the business. I remember United having a better cost structure, better positioning going into a growth year in a very long time if ever than you\u2019ve go now.","So let me ask a question about one of those things that interesting to me that you performed well on which is the cash flow. It\u2019s I guess multi, part one, why the strength; two, does this change in anyway your thoughts around share repurchases versus deleveraging versus investments in the business for 2016; and three, you know if you are going to - it seems like 2016 guidance is perhaps a little bit more conservative, it\u2019s not a little modest on the cash flow, and I was just wondering what you think might change?","Stephen Hemsley","Dave will touch on beginning of that and then we\u2019ll get into the share buyback, invest, et cetera as part two.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Sheryl. First thank you for the recognition of the hard work this team has done this year particularly in the last half of the year to get this cost structures aligned and to really position its business for growth in 2016 and beyond.","Our cash flows were exceptionally strong I think you know from past calls and discussions that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re very, very, very focused on cash flows and in particular managing balance sheet elements of our business and the strength of the cash flows are the departure from what our original expectations where really around collecting receivables more quickly and paying claims more in line with what our contractual requirements are as opposed to paying it early. So just better working capital management and really contributed to that.","As it relates to within what our priorities are for that is around share repurchases, deleveraging and investment, we are going to continue to maintain a very balance posture with respect to those things. Obviously it\u2019s important that we continue to deliver the business as we had indicated that we would over the course of 18 months following the Catamaran transaction and we continue to be committed to doing so. Part of that is that our expectations that will continue to curtail our share repurchases at least for 2016, you know less extreme circumstances arise but for 2016 to about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in cash use. And as you can probably suspect by the activity that\u2019s underway in our business, we continue to be a strong investor and new capabilities organically in our business but also through quested means.","As it relates to 2016 and the cash flow, it\u2019s certain jumping off about $9.7 billion cash flow year with stronger earnings expectations for 2016, you would expect would achieve higher cash flows. And as a result, we used language of $9.5 to $10 billion in cash flows are now taking closer to $10 billion. And we\u2019ll take a hard look at that over the course of the first quarter and reassess whether not we can push that number forward. But clearly the business is operating well from the balance sheet management perspective, we\u2019ll do all we can do to move that the cash flow number forward.","Sheryl Skolnick","Excellent, thank you so much.","Stephen Hemsley","Next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. I just had a one follow-up first on the exchanges. At the Investor Day, I know you talked about assuming around negative a 15% margin in the exchanges, just as you work through sort of the updated math is, is that still how we should be thinking about that or sort of different relative to that number?","And then just a follow-up question, just interested outside of the exchange just on the membership front, how membership ended up developing for the rest of the commercial risk business for the 2016 enrollment period most notably in the small group segment? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. We\u2019ll let Dan comment on the first on the first and then Jeff also kind of speak to the business in \u201816.","Dan Schumacher","Good morning, Scott. So where we landed on a policy year basis as we closed our 2014, our policy year losses on the exchanges were in that mid-double-digit rate, mid-teens range that we talked about in the Investor Conference, so 15%, 16%. And if you look at 2016 on a policy year basis, we expect that to moderate some, we\u2019d be into the low-double digits from a margin percentage basis with higher enrollment base, lower percentage margin losses again on those things that I talked about earlier, so the strength of our pricing, the repositioning of our product portfolio and then our management efforts underneath that. So hopefully that provide the sense for what you are looking for and then Jeff on the enrollment.","Jeff Alter","Sure. Good morning, Scott. This is Jeff Alter. So we closed out \u201815 with very strong growth across both our fully insured and sub-funded product. I would say driving a good part of that was increase retention of our existing clients in certain markets we saw the market come back to our pricing particularly in small group. We also had the opportunity to win back a very large part of the health republic small group block in New York in our rates. And as you recall, from early \u201814 one of our headwinds was that health republic pricing against our small group block in New York, so we were in position to win that back during the four quarter of \u201815, which is good.","We also couple with very strong specialty sales, our vision in dental products are selling really well. And I think it plays to sort of our value in the market place, our strong brand, our consisting pricing and the ability for the folks to take advantage of our you know increasing innovation in the market place, the service that we deliver and our efforts to make the healthcare system a little simple for our members. So we\u2019re encouraged by the growth that we had over the last 18 months, we see that momentum continuing as we paced into \u201816 and feel good about what that will deliver in \u201816 and \u201816 and beyond for our shareholders and our members.","Scott Fidel","Okay, thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Pretty positive and so many we\u2019ll just take two more questions and then as you know John and Brett will available through the course of the day for the - for questions and any other areas of interest. So maybe two more questions, please.","Operator","And we can take our first question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi Group. Please go ahead.","Ralph Jacoby","Thanks, good morning. Just want to go back to cash flow, again seemed even stronger than usual. Are you holding back claims at all with ICD10 implementation and maybe just generally speaking, are you seeing any impact at this point from sort of coding in a QD perspective relative to your expectations? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Not at all, but I\u2019ll let Dave handle that and others who want to comment on coding. But that - those are not issues at all. Dave?","David Wichmann","I am sure what to add to that. Not at all, those are not issues at all. No, this is just purely really more refined cash flow management principals across the company. The enterprise is doing well and really managing cash flows. Obviously the performance of the business stands, exchanges is strong and then we coupled out with the balance sheet management. We are not holding claims or doing anything other than paying them in accordance with contractual terms, it\u2019s part of the value that comes from more integrated UnitedHealth Group then what we\u2019ve experienced in the past with more fragmented healthcare platforms or claims education platforms as we continue to move towards a common set of technologies, working more closely with Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of strong cash flow.","Stephen Hemsley","And on in terms of ICD10, maybe we\u2019ll go real quick to UnitedHealthcare as it relates to them and then flip to Optum and talk about more broadly the industry and what we are seeing.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Ralph, it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. From an ICD10 standpoint, there is really nothing to update from the Investor Conference and my comments there, the reality is we are paying tens of millions of claims in the ICD10 that code set. And as you look inbound volumes, rejection rates, auto adjudication rates, throughputs, ending inventory all the way through that process stream, I would tell you all of that is in line. And so there is nothing getting hung up, nothing getting slow down. In today\u2019s point really around the cash flow, it really comes down to just managing better to contract terms as well have more of our business on common platforms which allows us to do those kinds of offsets.","Stephen Hemsley","In terms of OptumInsight, sure, I always - we believe we have an extremely strong product line that were offering that\u2019s increasing productivity and results and I\u2019ll ask John Prince to comment on that.","John Prince","I think Ralph in terms of ICD10, we\u2019ve been backed within that and preparing ICD10 for years. In terms of working for our customers, we\u2019ve actually had great results. One of the products that have the results of that compares to the coding, we\u2019ve actually had a very distinctive product in the market and the customers have used have actually have seen a significant increase in production versus traditional products to the market.","Stephen Hemsley","Thanks you, so one last question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take that question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Peter\u2019s question and your response around. What I thought, I heard this was upside to your guidance for 2016 and I am just looking at although the things that have developed we\u2019ve got a week through season, you pull forward even more losses from exchange in Medicaid, pricing looks pretty good, your reason stays stable have gone year-over-year by three days, your star membership rebalancing looks good as well and special enrolment period is maybe a tailwind, are there any headwinds are missing or should we think that there could be a upside to your consolidated carry show in your margins, that\u2019s your projecting to \u201816?","Stephen Hemsley","Well that is an excellent list, I am not sure I could have done better myself. You know I just think it is the 19th of January, I think we should be careful in terms of how we discussing our results, we have to truly work through the balance of our exchange, we do think we have reserve for it and consider that appropriately into our \u201816 numbers. And as I said it\u2019s the 19th of January and I think that we should you know more forward thoughtfully and prudently in our business. So I think those are the factors.","In terms of headwinds, I think we said before we have less than before but we clearly have to play out the year and that\u2019s what we intend to do. I think our focus is to really deliver a very clean, strong financial year to the market place to continue advance our business, continue to innovate, you know continue diversify across both the platform of UnitedHealthcare and Optum and kind of that\u2019s our focus. I think we are always endower to try to perform better, but I think our guidance right now is very appropriate range and I am assuming you\u2019ve taken some of the input in terms of how the quarters might play out from our commentary in our teleconference. So","I think we\u2019ll end up with that. And once again I\u2019ll thank you joining us today and I\u2019ll leave with few closing thoughts kind of as businesses, Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we think really advanced their capabilities significantly in 2015 and UnitedHealth Group\u2019s revenues and operating earnings grew significantly as cash flows increased as we talked about over 20% and our dividend has increased and we will certainly address that in the middle of the year as our custom. UnitedHealthcare served more than 1.7 million people domestically growing virtually in every market that we serve and Optum grew its revenues by 42% and its backlog by more than 20%.","In 2016, we expect to continue and accelerate this grow trend and carried into 2017 and beyond. We intend to further differentiate our products, our services by focusing on consistently high quality in everything we do and creating real value for customers and consumers on their terms. We remained committed to delivering clean, strong financial result as I said for our shareholders this year with a growing pipeline of future opportunities.","So we appreciate your interest today. This concludes our call and as I said John and Brett will be available through the course of the day. We thank you for your attention. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"21222":["UnitedHealth Group Inc.

I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. ","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company\u2019s Investors page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 16, 2017, which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the company\u2019s website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.","David Wichmann","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported 2017 results that are ahead of the outlook we shared with you at our investor conference at the end of November. Full year 2017 revenues exceeded $201 billion increasing more than $16 billion year-over-year. Operating cash flows grew to $13.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $10.07 per share with operating earnings from both UnitedHealthCare and Optum ahead of the forecast we provided at our conference.","We had an active December on the growth front. We wrapped up the fourth quarter serving the benefit needs of nearly one half million more consumers completing another successful sale season in individual group MA and dual special needs plans as we turn into 2018. And advancing our strategic positions in two of five growth categories by signing both Banmedica and DaVita Medical Group, while maintaining our operating focus to both closed 2017 strongly and we expect to carry that momentum into a healthy start to 2018.","We know the effects of tax changes for 2018 are top of mind for many. So we will begin there today with corporate tax reform. Our starting point for determining our approach was with our mission helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone and our recognition of the enormous gap between where healthcare is today and where it could and should be. We concluded that our ambitions for a better health and for a better health system are best achieved through investment in ways that will make healthcare far more affordable and of far higher quality.","More specifically corporate tax reform is expected to improve earnings and cash flows by $1.7 billion in 2018. That\u2019s after an estimated $400 million to $500 million reduction in premium revenues due to minimum loss ratio and lower net health insurance fee recapture effects and a 200 million to 300 million additional investment and operating costs as we accelerate existing initiatives and artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, digital health, net promoter score improvements and health related initiatives in local communities.","We expect to invest the remaining increased cash flows to better fulfill our mission and in turn to grow and diversify our enterprise for the long-term all aligned to the ambitious agenda we discussed with you on Investor Day.","We now expect adjusted 2018 earnings of $12.30 to $12.60 per share and cash flows from operations in the range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion. John Rex will offer more details later in this call and as usual we will be available by phone throughout the day.","Before leaving Texas, I would note that we continue to advocate strongly for our multi-year deferral and ultimately the repeal of the health insurance tax given its high cost to consumers and society. If a deferral for 2018 occurs, we plan to return the value to those impacted by the tax.","As highlighted in our investor conference, we are pursuing growth and diversification in five key areas, healthcare delivery, pharmacy care services, consumer centric benefits, digital healthcare and global. Our busy December helped us to advance these goals. The combination of OptumCare with DaVita Medical Group establishes primary and ambulatory healthcare delivery in several new local care markets for OptumCare. Through Banmedica and with Amil and Americas medical services in Brazil, we\u2019re establishing a foundation for growth in South America for decades to come.","And then Steve Nelson will discuss United Healthcare\u2019s 2018 growth in individual and group Medicare advantage and dual special needs plan should again lead the market.","Now let\u2019s turn to businesses starting with Optum\u2019s Chief Executive, Larry Renfro.","Larry Renfro","Thank you, Dave. Delivering strong results for Optum customers in 2017 enabled us to drive strong revenue and earnings growth and to create opportunities for further growth in 2018. Full year, 2017 Optum revenues increased 9% exceeding $91 billion. 2017 earnings from operations grew by nearly $1.1 billion or 19% with individual businesses earnings growth rate ranging from 16% to 28%.","We again balance innovation investments in our businesses and strategic acquisitions with business simplification and focused cost management. The result is improved margin performance. Our full year operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 7.4% including 9.1% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings from operations grew by more than 20% for every reporting business.","We entered 2018 with positive indicators for our business outlook. Optum helped serve 91 million people at year-end. Strong 10% growth on a large and growing base. In the fourth quarter, Optum Rx fulfilled 333 million adjusted scripts and OptumInsight advanced this backlog producing full year backlog growth of 19% to $15 billion. Our strategic relationships continued to advance as we became more deeply involved with an increasing number of sophisticated customers. Let me give you a few highlights.","In state government services, West Virginia became the first state to engage Optum to integrate program eligibility across all state sponsored health benefit program. Over half the state population or about 900,000 people will access Medicaid as well as other human surface benefits through Optum\u2019s new integrated eligibility platform.","We expect to build on our strong and differentiating capabilities serving health plans. Our health plan customers members, our patients, receive quality care from our physicians at local clinics and ambulatory sites of service. We had strong growth in data analytic work related to risk and quality and we received a multi-year award to manage the technology platform modernization for SSS, Blue Cross Blue Shield Puerto Rico.","The healthcare transformation alliance relationship is off to an excellent start with 10 companies selecting OptumRx, driven by their interest in quality, cost transparency and total cost management.","Finally, with the full implementation for Quest Diagnostic, completed their exceptional performance levels, we now manage more than $65 billion in annual billings on behalf of our diverse revenue management customers and the new client pipeline is vibrant.","Acquisitions this past year added market leading platforms, strengthening our capabilities and depth of resources. Surgical care affiliates with its leading ambulatory surgical care practice grew revenues 7% on a same-store basis, driven by ever more complex surgical procedures shifting to non-hospital settings.","We plan to accelerate center development in 2018 and 2019. We expanded OptumCare primary care driven practices into 10 new major metropolitan areas. This includes our pending acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, with more than 2000 employed or affiliated physicians serving 2 million patients annually.","Like our OptumCare doctors, DMG physicians our well known for delivering high quality care to their patients and are seasoned and are working in a value-based care context on behalf of a diverse group of the most respectful payers. Combined with DMG, OptumCare will be in 35 local care delivery markets, nearly one-half of the 75 markets targeted for engagement or development. And these market operations are still in the early stages of growth and development, a fraction of the size they are targeted ultimately.","And we combine with The Advisory Board, the market leader in healthcare research, consulting and technology. We expect Optum to bring further resources, capabilities and value serving the 4,000 hospitals and health systems that comprise The Advisory Board\u2019s membership. And we look forward to accelerating their engagement in the next six months.","Finally, we continue to innovate to better serve market needs. We doubled the number of people with Rally IDs in 2017, now more than 15 million, while administrating more than $400 million in consumer incentives. Market interest for this type of scale tested solution is growing. A large local health plan selected Rally as its consumer technology platform and several renowned hospitals are now using Rally for everything from searching for a physician to pricing the appointment and appointment schedule.","We launched PreCheck MyScript connecting patients, physicians and health firms with useful information at the point of prescribing, right in the physician\u2019s workflow. PreCheck MyScript has already being used by tens of thousands of prescribers for nearly 1.5 million transactions. We will offer it to all OptumRx members expecting to reach 80% of active prescribers by the end of 2019.","And we unified our unique data science and analytics capabilities under the OptumRx brand. We are optimistic about our current progress and our long-term opportunities to continue to advance NPS, to raise quality, to innovate and develop and grow relationships, making the healthcare system work better for everyone.","Optum was built over 20 years but we are only just beginning to get a glimpse of its potential.","Now let me turn it over to Steve Nelson, the CEO of the UnitedHealthCare.","Steve Nelson","Thank you, Larry. Like Optum, we\u2019re pleased to report strong growth and performance across our businesses on behalf of those that we serve. UnitedHealthCare\u2019s 2017 revenues exceeded $163 billion, and grew 10% year-over-year. 3 of our 4 businesses posted percentage growth rates in the mid-teens or higher. An employer and individual offerings performed exceptionally well, growing 9% absent the $5.3 billion negative impact of reduced participation and ACA Individual Insurance products and the 2017 Health Insurance Tax Moratorium.","Medical costs were well managed for the year and our full year medical care ratio was near the lower end of our original forecast. The full year 2017 commercial medical cost trend was about 5.5% and we continue to forecast the trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points for 2018. Operating costs were well controlled in 2017 as operating margins strengthened 30 basis points to 5.2% with fourth quarter operating margin seasonally lower as expected.","We improved our positioning for 2018 and for the long-term. Together with Optum, we renewed early the AERP relationship, a key long-term positive for growth serving the senior\u2019s community. We also strengthen our ability to address the social determinants of healthcare to better serve people with complex needs. And we\u2019re seeing strong interest for multi-site employers in the Nexus ACO products, the first national ACO product targeted to large self-funded customers looking for higher quality and cost performance. Nexus ACO leverages UnitedHealth premium physicians to achieve cost savings of up to 15% as customers see reductions in readmissions, ER visits, inpatient length of stay, and hospital admissions.","We expanded into several new markets including the western slope of Colorado and upstate New York. And we\u2019ll enter Minnesota and the northern planes in the second half of 2018. And we began to advance the next generation of digital health and wellness management which is available for seniors based on connected wearable devices and wireless technology. Participants in the UnitedHealthCare Motion Wellness Program have used activity trackers to walk 65 million miles, earning nearly $20 million in incentives to cover out of pocket medical expenses.","In 2017, we served 2 million more people in the U.S. employer group, Medicare and Medicaid market segments, including almost 0.5 million more people in the fourth quarter. In Medicaid, we grew by more than 800,000 people in 2017 reflecting entries into new state, support for 110,000 more dual special needs plan numbers and a significant late year expansion in Iowa. In 2018, we expect further growth from our 2017 entries into California and Virginia from further acceleration in serving dual needs special plans and from continued in-market organic growth. The Medicaid pipeline for 2019 and beyond continues to be robust as states increasingly look to manage care for innovation, effective service and cost containment.","In Medicare, we serve nearly 1 million more seniors in 2017 and we again expect strong growth in 2018 consistent with our expectations. Based on performance in the annual enrollment period, high customer retention and continued success serving employer group retirees through our national four-star quality plan. In UnitedHealth employer and individual, commercial group full risk offerings group served 130,000 more people this quarter and 465,000 over the past year. We expect some modest pull back in membership in the first quarter followed by sequentially quarterly growth over the balance of the year led by strength and small group fully in line with our Investor Conference growth projections.","In global, our Brazil businesses had strong positive 2017 performance and carried that momentum into 2018. We expect to add Banmedica in the first quarter 2018. Banmedica is a provider of healthcare services and health benefits in Chile, Columbia and Peru serving 2.1 million people and operating 13 hospitals with 1,900 beds and 143 medical centers.","In many ways the growth opportunities apparent in these South American markets are reminiscent of the opportunities in healthcare markets in the US two decades ago, when consumers and benefits sponsors were seeking better managed benefits and access at lower cost, Medicare advantage plans and managed Medicaid were nascent and Part D did not exist. We expect opportunities for growth in these markets to advance as we have in the past two decades or more in the US. Our 2017 growth and our 2018 outlook demonstrate the competitive value our offerings bring to consumers and the market, rising rates of customer retention and strong new business generation reflect the sustaining value of innovative benefit and network designs, improved service, rising NPS, distinguished clinical engagement and effective cost control.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","John Rex","Thank you, Steve. We delivered strong well-balanced performance again in 2017. Consolidated revenues exceeded $201 billion, cash flow from operations were $13.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $10.07 increased 25% on top of 25% earnings growth in 2016. We re-valued our US deferred tax liabilities to reflect the newly enacted federal statutory rate of 21% which added $1.2 billion in non-cash earnings in 2017. We have excluded this from adjusted earnings per share. Our expectations for 2018 have been revised solely to reflect the lower expected tax rate now approximately 24%. The incremental investments Dave referred too and items such as rebate obligations related to loss ratio requirements, triggered by the lower tax rate.","The change affects several line items which I will step through. We now expect adjusted net earnings per share of $12.30 to $12.60 in 2018, with cash flows from operations rising $1.7 billion from our prior outlook to a range of 15 billion to 15.5 billion. Dave referenced the $400 million to $500 million impact on premium revenues, which we expect to accommodate within the existing $223 billion to $225 billion revenue range we set at our November Investor Conference.","We now expect UnitedHealth Group earnings from operations to be in the range of $16.7 billion to $17.3 billion in 2018. This is reduced by 700 million from the prior range. Roughly 400 million to 500 million of which is driven by the premium effects of the new lower tax rate with greater than half attributed to a lower insurers fee gross up. The other factor within this $700 million reflects the end year P&L impact from the investments Dave noted to better serve people and improve the healthcare system, while strengthening our growth and innovation value.","We expect these accelerated investments will result in 200 million to 300 million in incremental operating expense. Our current plans while still maturing allocate these investments to both businesses, leaning toward Optum. We now expect our 2018 medical care ratio to run in a range of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. With the midpoint increasing is much as 30 basis points from our prior outlook, again driven solely by mechanics related to the tax rate change.","In addition, with these impacts, we expect our 2018 operating cost ratio to run in a range of 15.3% plus or minus 30 basis points with the midpoint 10 basis points above our prior outlook.","With respect to our overall capital position and outlook, we expect to continue to follow our longstanding approach to capital allocation. This includes maintaining a consistent approach of investing in the business and returning capital to shareholder, steadily pacing toward a market rate dividend, while targeting a debt to total capital ratio in the 40% range over the long-term.","All of the above is contained in the revise 2018 guidance table included in our supplemental information package this morning. The takeaways are that we entered 2018 with growth and earnings momentum and strong financial flexibility, a significantly improved cash flow outlook and a debt to total capital ratio below 39% at year-end 2017 with clear opportunities to put capital to work. Dave?","David Wichmann","Thank you, John. 2017 was a strong year for UnitedHealth Group by virtually every measure. Top-line growth, rising NPS, strengthening culture and service, strategic advances, operational execution and as a result, strong financial performance. We are entering 2018 with solid momentum and a clear direction and much to get done. We plan to sustain this ambitious pace most importantly because our mission and culture and those we serve require it. Our goal remains realizing the full growth service and social potential of this remarkable enterprise. Thank you for your investment and interest in support of that goal.","We will now open the call for questions. Asking you to limit to one question a piece, so we can get to as many as possible.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. I appreciate some of the detail on tax reform. Just wanted to drill down here a little bit more. First, you talked about the 400 to 500 million and most of that or more than half of that being from the health insurer fee impact. I think it's pretty clear that you know the grossed up of the Medicaid - Medicaid states would require to give you back, needs to be smaller because the taxes go down, but beyond that can you help us understand how much that is of the half or more that\u2019s 400 to 500, how much is commercial and how much is Medicare that you might have passed through which I assume is zero on Medicare. And then more importantly for 2019, would love to hear your thoughts on the sustainability of the tax reform benefit that you\u2019re seeing here in 2018 including any differentiation on that sustainability by business would be really helpful. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Good question Justin, appreciate it. We\u2019ll have John Rex talk about the -- give you a little bit more details on the impact of the $400 million to $500 million on premiums. As it relates to 2019, we\u2019re not really in a position to give elemental guidance at this stage. I understand the question but hopefully you can also appreciate that is as is always the case with respect to market dynamics particularly in the commercial market with respect to pricing it subject to a number of variables including negotiation and also attribution of cost. So, it\u2019s not as -- not to belittle it at all but it's not as simple as applying math. This is something though that as the year progresses and we see what happens with the health insurance tax, we will be very deliberate and making sure that we quantify the effects of that and do so in the context of giving you guidance for 2019. John do you want to discuss the four to five please.","John Rex","Yes, good morning Justin. Let me just give a little more background on how that works which will benefit everyone on the call here. So just recall, when we look through how this works through our P&L, the larger component as I mentioned in my prepared comments is the impact of the lower premium gross, the federal tax rate decline. So, remember the health insurance tax of course in non-deductible, that results in a gross upon the premium line and that flows through the P&L and that impacts the number of ratios as you heard me describe this morning across the P&L.","So as a result of the gross at the pre-tax operating earnings of course were impacted. As that requirement declines, it\u2019s neutral on the after-tax earnings line but it impacts pre-tax. So that\u2019s really what we are attempting to go through here. I think you spotlighted one of the kind of the easiest to understand ones in terms of some of our state program arrangements here where really when we went into this, the arrangements for the state were explicitly around being made whole for the tax gross up because of the non-deductibility. So that has an explicit impact as that declines and so some of those state arrangements are explicitly that way and so when we go to collect that we\u2019ll be collecting a gross up rate of 21%. There are other businesses where they have some impact, to contractual arrangements. I\u2019m not going to parse them out in terms of the specific amounts we\u2019ve joined as Dave described. But you\u2019re right about kind of how that impact flows through.","Justin Lake","I am sorry just wanted to confirm here. In Medicare I think you guys have talked about the gross up not having -- you never passed it through to consumers via lower benefits. So that doesn\u2019t need to be given back. Is that correct? And then on commercial, how much of commercial do you expect to get back over time and how much is already in this number? Thank you.","David Wichmann","Well, Justin we are -- as it relates to in Medicare in particular -- obviously that\u2019s all subject to a discussion with CMS and negotiation that occurs in connection with the offering of the annual benefits. Our goals are always to maintain as much consistency as possible and benefit offerings, network access, pharmacy offerings, formularies as much as possible to keep those benefits as stable as can be. That\u2019s one of the leading contributors to a very strong net promoter scores with that population. So again, our goals there are to maintain as much stability as possible.","As it relates to the market, if you think about what we have here, we\u2019ve got two businesses. One which is regulated and one unregulated. But the regulated business taxes if you will, we have the tax of value of that if you will a piece of that, a good chunk of it goes back to the market through these recapture mechanisms that we\u2019ve outlined here this morning, that\u2019s the 400 million to 500 million that John described.","In addition to that, we thought it would be best that we then invest in things that we know happened to be through our P&L, in this case of areas we know where we can improve healthcare quality and reduce healthcare costs in the future. That\u2019s a 200 million to 300 million that John described as well. The vast majority of the residual is either attributed to the Optum business and\/or we felt was best and most appropriate for us to invest in continuing to advance healthcare quality and reduce healthcare costs really aimed at trying to achieve this mission around helping people and helping to improve health systems.","So that\u2019s where we are at today. We think it\u2019s a fair balance. We think that that balance is something that\u2019s sustainable over the long haul.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi, good morning. I figured there will be a lot of questions on tax pass-through, I'm going to avoid that one. In your OptumHealth build out, I am curious to what extent or how far along are we in the process of your benefit designs on the UnitedHealthcare side including some type of favorability toward OptumHealth networks, is that something you can do now, is it something that you plan to do, is it something that you need to build more critical mass in OptumCare before you can get there? I am curious about how much -- if you are building a plan that helps the healthcare system to work better, I would think you would want to favor that, I am wondering how much you are doing there?","David Wichmann","It\u2019s a great question Dave and it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s often misunderstood about our OptumCare platform, and that is a multi-payer platform. It serves 80 plus payers broadly. The dynamics around its offerings to the market, particularly around pricing are negotiated including with UnitedHealthcare, there is no favoritism applied other than what you would characterize as normal dynamics in a marketplace. And so, our intention is to not -- is to provide a broad offering and engage the ambitions of all payers so that we can serve more patients. But Andrew, do you want to touch on maybe some of our strategies there and how we\u2019re advancing that business?","Andrew Hayek","In today\u2019s comments, we are very much committed at Optum and in OptumCare to a multi payer strategy and serving multi payers in the markets we serve is integral to our business models including our medical groups, our IPAs, our ambulatory surgery centers and our neighborhood care centers. So, we work to earn and maintain the trust and confidence of our payer partners around the country. And we do that by providing outstanding value to the members and the communities we serve in terms of quality, patient experience and impacting the total cost of care. And then as you look at the track record that we have as we added IPAs, medical groups, as we added SCA, as we added MedExpress, we have continued the multi-payer strategy of those entities. And in fact, we\u2019ve worked very carefully with each of those payer partners to expand those relationships, continue to serve them and help their success.","David Wichmann","So, Dave it\u2019s fair to say those that get kind of closest to OptumCare, the payers that do are the ones that get the best value out of it. And certainly, UnitedHealthCare works very collaboratively with OptumCare, but several of our payer, our customers do as well. Next question please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll next to Matt Borsch with the BMO Capital Markets.","Matt Borsch","Thank you. I was hoping that you could just talk about medical trend. And from a couple of different dimensions, number one, to understand as your outlook for going back up to the 6% range versus 5.5% that you experienced, is that just the conservatism that we\u2019ve seen from UNH over the last several years or is there something specific? And I guess related to that is, what you think the impact to the economy is here? And if you\u2019re surprised at all by the 2017 if anything, it seems like a softening of trend relative to the prior year? And sorry, if I could fit this one in and that base of question of the pace of benefits change in the high deductible plan impact in this mix?","David Wichmann","Okay, that\u2019s all right, Matt, I will try to get all those answered. As it relates to medical trend in 2017, our teams worked very hard to control healthcare cost. Usually, our forward view of trend is comprehensive and it also reflected deep respect for the healthcare economy and the ways trends developed overtime. But, I think our teams did a really nice job of continuing to mitigate trend for 2017 and have done -- have taken a prudent approach for 2018 and beyond. Do you want to talk at all about the how trend has advanced year-over-year and maybe what some of the elemental items are?","Larry Renfro","As Steve Nelson mentioned in his commentary and as Dave touched on where we\u2019re now at 5.5%. So right at the low end of the range from a year ago that we laid out, but completely in line with our investor conference. It really reflects as Dave mentioned, our efforts to manage cost and improve quality and we continue to do that through things like ensuring the right level of care, the right place of service, the effectiveness of our clinical model, alignment with our partnerships and we\u2019re really seeing -- the improvements have really been broad base across our category, I wouldn\u2019t point to anything specific, wouldn\u2019t point to the economy especially around that as well. And as Dave mentioned as to 2018, we\u2019re always respectful of trend and there is nothing that we\u2019ve seen as we closed out 2017 that would view our change at this point for 2018.","Matt Borsch","What about the pace of benefit change in on how that\u2019s obviously played a role as you move to more employers to high deductible plans. Is that continuing at the same rate going into this year?","David Wichmann","Dan Schumacher, will comment on that, Matt.","Dan Schumacher","Good morning, Matt. It\u2019s Dan.","Matt Borsch","Good morning.","Dan Schumacher","As you look at the benefits what couple of dimensions to it, right. We have -- if you look at the deductibles, deductibles are rising a little bit faster in 2018 as compared to the rate of increase in 2017 and in part due to the reintroduction, I think of the insurers feed that\u2019s pushing pricing up and putting some pressure on employers to make more adjustments to the benefits. If you look at aggregate buy downs, I think those are relatively comparable year-over-year, but if you just look at the proportion of people that are buying and choosing more progressive plan designs, I would say that that has been a long-standing trend that continues in 2018, just a thing that was in 2017.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tanal","Thanks a lot for the questions, guys. Wanted to just touch on the $400 million to $500 of minimum MLR rebates. I\u2019m sort of curious to understand whether that had anything to do with sort of pricing plans for the all tax regime and what that could mean for 2019. And relatedly on the incremental investments side of things these were described as accelerated programs in the release. And I\u2019m wondering if you can sort of give us a flavor for how much flexibility that might enable for 2018 and then looking into 2019 as well?","David Wichmann","Maybe we will have John Rex address the fore part of that question and then I\u2019ll wrap on the investments.","John Rex","Let me just get back to that. So, to be clear here on the $400 million to $500 million, that\u2019s comprised of two components and the minimum MLR rebate component of that is less than half of that component. The greater component has to do with just really the lower premium gross ups as the federal tax rate declines. I just really want to be clear on that in terms of how that works. So minimum MLRs, less than half of that $400 million to $500 million, it\u2019s really just the mechanical impacts, the recapture impact on the lower premium gross up, that is the majority of $400 million to $500 million. And Dave will address the investments.","David Wichmann","So, Steven it\u2019s a very good question. So, what we\u2019ve done here is we really have investment occurring on two fronts. One is it relates to the $200 million to $300 million as I described earlier, it\u2019s going through the P&L and that\u2019s the one when you\u2019re picking up on a lot of those investments through the P&L are in the application of technology if you will across the business and in order to accomplish a number of things, it\u2019s to both improve the quality of our services to people which includes the advancing of our MPS ambitions which I think we\u2019ve laid out pretty strongly as well as to continue to find ways to improve cost structure thereby delivering greater value broadly to the health system and to individual consumers within it.","You should look at that as an uptick in the run rate expectations of our level of investments, partly in response to the tax, a great change if you will. Beyond that is the balance, which is $1.7 billion or so in improved cash flows in the business. And that you\u2019ll see us align more quickly strategically in the market to advance things like our care delivery platforms, which we just discussed.","As you know, we are not quite midway through the establishment of the foundation of our market presence in local markets in that business, as an example. So that additional investments and technology related platforms to advance things like precision medicine, genomics, things of that nature where we believe we can apply our capacities as an organization are some of the areas that you will see us advance our investment portfolio.","Operator","And the next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael Baker","Just trying to get a sense of the size of the PBM pipeline of opportunities this year compared to last year. And if you could gave a little bit of color on market segments that are more active that would be helpful?","David Wichmann","We see nice growth in the PBM, both this year, including the growth within our customer base and we have a nice pipe for 2019. John?","John Rex","So we just finished off a really strong year. We had our new business targets. We also had really good retention as I talked about at Investor Day we\u2019re at almost 98% in terms of our retention. We\u2019ve seen solid growth both with our existing client based, including health plans. So really broad based both across all market segments for 2018. In terms of 2019, I think it's still early. We have a really good pipeline, but their pipeline year-over-year is pretty similar, but it\u2019s actually still early.","We have some wins for 01\/01\/19 already, so we\u2019re seeing strong active growth for the market. And I\u2019d say the big deals we won\u2019t care about until the end of first quarter, so strong pipeline and good growth. I don\u2019t see any changes in terms of what market segments are selling more than others right now. And I\u2019d say last summer comment is that our value story in the market is really resonating. We\u2019re seeing strong interest from sophisticated buyers that are attractive to our pharmacy care services model.","Operator","Our next question is from A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A .J. Rice","Maybe I\u2019ll just ask you about the acquisition pace, seems like in \u201917 and accelerated and it certainly as we went through the year, it seemed to accelerate as we got toward the end. I mean that could be a function of greater availability of deals; it could be a function of particularly and after we build out the infrastructure; you feel more confident as you can integrate them faster pace of deals; it could be the balance sheet is now as your target. Can you give us a flavor for R&D? We\u2019re in an environment where your acquisition pace is likely to accelerate. And maybe I\u2019ll just throw in there an update on the international outlook since I know both Optum and UHC have pointed to that as a growth area and with the BenMedica deal maybe that brings you back into focus a little bit?","David Wichmann","Thank you, A. J., very good question. There really is nothing -- we really didn\u2019t accelerate the pace of our acquisition, it's just coincidental that those two acquisitions happen to come at that time. As indicated, they line up nicely with two of the five growth areas of our business. We\u2019ve long indicated that we have an interest in measured investments in global, and that BenMedica allowed us to get into three additional South American markets. We have been studying those markets for about five years, and that allowed us to advance our position there. As you know, we\u2019re in an open process right now to close that transaction.","And then the other one was the DMG acquisition, which again I would characterize as more coincidental but highly strategic in terms of our ambitions and interest in building the Optum care platform overall. So really no acceleration, you shouldn\u2019t infer anything with respect to how we\u2019re allocating capital broadly.","I would like to just take a moment, if I can, to have Molly Joseph who is our Chief Executive of our International Business, UnitedHealthcare International, maybe just spend a moment on BenMedica and our positioning in South America broadly.","Molly Joseph","Thanks for the question A. J. Let me just offer my perspective on three things related to our global expansion; first is the business progression we\u2019ve seen in Brazil; second, the pending transaction with BenMedica; and then perhaps touching on how we view Latin America, more broadly. Brazil, we\u2019ve started 2017 with pretty ambitious expectations for the business, particularly in the area of margin improvement. And that was across both our health benefits and our BenMedical delivery businesses. Very pleased that we\u2018ve fully executed on that plan.","The improvements are really being driven by a combination of a very strong local management team that focused on innovation and quality and increasing, the localized application of our enterprise capabilities and competencies in clinical, in technology, in data and analytics.","So we entered 2018 in Brazil with really strong momentum for continued margin expansion and quality advancement, which brings me to BenMedica. As Dave mentioned, BenMedica is a organization that we have known for a very long time and we have suddenly built the market for a long time. There are market leader across Chile, Columbia and Peru, in both healthcare benefits and medical delivery. And they have a really strong local management team with a proven track record in delivering very consistent high margin growth across both lines of their business and across all three of those countries.","So similar to Brazil, we see a opportunity to create value by combining that strong local team and that strong platform with our enterprise capability, again across, clinical, technology and data and analytics. Transaction is currently in an open tender process and we would expect to close that yet this quarter.","So pivoting then to our view of Latin America more broadly. We see really attractive healthcare dynamics and characterized by a growing demand for affordable private healthcare. And our acquisition of BenMedica will put us in a leading position in four of the largest economies across that region. Collectively, these countries have a population roughly equal to that of the U.S., but perhaps more growth opportunity in these emerging private healthcare markets, as well as a broader and longer term opportunity to serve the systems more holistically by also serving public markets.","So we think we\u2019re really well positioned for the value creation over the long horizon and we are focused on bringing value to those markets.","David Wichmann","So we took a little bit of time there, because you hadn\u2019t had the chance to discuss this at our investor conference. And of course, this came right on the hills of that as the DMG, which we\u2019ve already referred to earlier today. As it relates to the international markets, in particular, I just want to stress again that our approaches to those markets will be measured approach to deployment capital in those markets will be measured, and deeply respectful of the volatility that\u2019s inherent in each one of those.","And our expectations are that they provide returns that are reflective of those risks and risk profiles that exist in each of those markets. Not to belabor this, but there was one other acquisition that we had closed, The Advisory Board that I might just ask Larry Renfro to make a few comments on as well. Thanks.","Larry Renfro","So A. J., I know this would be something important to you, The Advisory Board where you closed, I think it was in the latter part of November. So we\u2019re in the process of implementing the Optum playbook in terms of integration and alignment, but it\u2019s gone extremely well. Well received it in the marketplace. And we really believe that this is going to enhance our sales pipeline, as well as our sales for 2018. It\u2019s very, very complementary business and their management team is strong and it\u2019s so complementary to us. We\u2019re looking for a lot of good things out of The Advisory Board.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Rigg","Actually just had a follow-up on the international and global strategy. When we think about at least South America, do you think overtime this becomes one cross-border enterprise under a unified brand name, or is it a portfolio approach where you\u2019ll continue to run both businesses separately for the long-term? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Just like North America, South America is an inherently local market. And so in that regard at least for the time being, we have two very strong or three very strong brands now in Brazil, both Amil and Am\u00e9ricas M\u00e9dicos Servi\u00e7os and then in Chile, Colombia and Peru, predominantly Chile, BenMedica is the holding company. But they also operate with a series of very recognizable local brand names, both in healthcare delivery as well as healthcare insurance.","So I think you will continue to see that posture. To the extent that we need to clarify that like we\u2019ve been doing with some branding activity in Brazil this past year, we will do so. But for the most part we\u2019re deeply respectful of the brand value that these folks have created overtime.","Operator","And the next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.","Josh Raskin","So wanted to talk a little bit about med stuff, and I am curious what percentage of your book today has first dollar coverage. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about migration strategy going that one open enrollment period before the changes take effect for 2020? And I guess I am just curious on the economics of that switch. I assume the dollars are -- gross margin dollars are higher. But I would be curious if the returns are any better. And then lastly, do you think this is a big impact on the industry, i. e., a step function for MA in 2020 or do you think this is going to be more incremental? Thanks.","David Wichmann","As you might suspect, a lot of the growth we\u2019ve seen MA comes from our Medicare supplement products overall. But I would ask Brian Thompson maybe to more specifically respond to your question.","Brian Thompson","Sure, Dave. Good morning, -- thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the last point. I don't see this as a big transformative change. We\u2019ve seen this and been aware of this change. [Audio Gap] for some years now. We have the vast majority of our business today in first dollar coverage, but have been very pleased with our introduction of what we call the Plan G in the middle of 2017 and we are certainly seeing that resonate in the marketplace.","But actually in terms of the seniors' perspective, we like the continuation and really the collision of both the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare supplement products in the marketplace really provide broad, good choice for those that are choosing. And again as we're selling right now very pleased with the margins on both plans, I don't think there is much as to be differentiated in terms of economics of either. But certainly don't think this as a big move over the long-term.","Operator","And the next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Fischbeck","I wanted to go back to tax reform and the long-term sustainability of the benefit. I appreciate that facing change over the next year, so you have to watch and wait. I guess I start with United actually and actually almost literally wrote the book on pricing per membership. And although I guess competitors might decide to put that back in the benefits, you obviously don't have to follow a suite. And so I would think that would be largely -- how much of benefits you decided to keep versus not keep, so maybe you could give some perspective on that. And then is there any thoughts initially about where you think competition wise there might be more pressure within the business? I would think that most of the Optum businesses actually will probably have less pressure than the health plan businesses. But want to get your perspective on that?","David Wichmann","So as it relates to the $400 million to $500 million, just again to reiterate, most of that is the combination of two things. One is the minimum MLR amount so that we would need to return to policyholders, if you will. And then, the second relates to the lower tax rate on the health insurance tax. So that is what I would characterize is more of a -- I hate to say, but more of a mechanical element, if you will, and returning those premium values to consumers.","As it relates to sustainability, again, I would urge you to think about the tax reform affecting our cash flows and earnings, as in a bifurcated way. One is, as it relates to the services business, which -- and as well as all the unregulated aspects of UnitedHealthCare, which are substantive. Those components are the ones that we're retaining and investing, if you will. And then think about the other half or the other portions being that, which relates to the regulated entity, of which you can see a substantial dollar amount is being returned to the market.","On top of that, we invest in managing healthcare costs better, as well as applying better services. And then on top of that, invest more fully in what I'll characterize as more substantive event or transformative change to improve the health system and improve our offerings broadly to the marketplace.","So in our view, we believe it to be sustainable, because of the fact that we have such a substantive amount that's already been reverted back in premium values, plus the other changes that we\u2019ve outlined. So our intention is at this stage from this distance, which is it\u2019s pretty early on, that we\u2019ve made the right allocations if you will in determining how to best utilize this tax reform value.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Just want to ask a little bit about OptumRx, and it looks like the revenue growth accelerated -- year-to-year revenue growth accelerated sequentially and the OI accelerated pretty meaningfully the growth there sequentially. And anything you wanted to call out for us there.","David Wichmann","Gary, I\u2019m not sure we got your question, it that was fairly broken. So if you could rephrase it please.","Gary Taylor","I was asking about OptumRx.","David Wichmann","Okay. Thank you, much better.","Gary Taylor","And the question was, it looks like the revenue growth, year-to-year revenue growth, accelerated sequentially a fair amount than and the OI growth accelerate pretty substantially, sequentially as well. Just wondered if you could give us a little more color on that performance?","David Wichmann","Sure. I\u2019d ask John Prince, please.","John Prince","In terms of the acceleration, I think the key driver of that is our strong increase in adjusted scripts. So if you look at our volume, which is driving our business, our adjusted scripts is up 5%. Our scripts are actually been accelerated all year long. So our script growth was the highest in Q4 versus any other quarter in the year. So that is really driven by the success we\u2019ve had in the market in terms of taking on new clients, winning new business and keeping our existing clients. And so that is the key driver from it.","One other driver from it has also been the Specialty Pharmacy business. So we highlighted that at Investor Day that we\u2019ve been very successful in the specialty market, that\u2019s the market where you both plan with existing business and also compete in the open market. Our value story has been resonating. Our experience has been very solid, both for members and physicians. And so we\u2019ve been getting a lot of uptake in our specialty pharmacy business, that all has been driving our overall revenue growth. So very solid from the business standpoint.","David Wichmann","Thank you for your question, Gary. We\u2019re going to pick up the pace here a little bit to try to get in this as many questions as possible. Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","A little bit of time has passed and you\u2019ve had more time to think about the executive order and lack of individual mandate. Any updated thoughts on how disruptive you think that will or won\u2019t be, maybe have you had dialogue with small group. What\u2019s your sense for their appetite and maybe change their approach. And does that at all relate to your commentary on your call around enrolment being pulling back I guess in 1Q and coming back due to small group, I think. If you could flush that out as well. Thanks.","David Wichmann","So I\u2019ll address the executive order and then I\u2019ll have Jeff Alter to talk about the market dynamics here in just a moment. So the executive order had three components to it, the one I think that has the most momentum or at least initial momentum is around the association how plans, but we also have HRA and short-term limited duration policy considerations as well. So what I think happening across all of these is that the administration is pursuing an expansion of products that are available to consumers and in an effort to lead to more participation. And I think that that also lead to more insurance market stability broadly.","So we\u2019re supportive of that, of expanding the choice of the offerings that consumer has and continues have. And I think each and every one of these regulations are really geared in that way. So we\u2019re supportive of these efforts to improve choice and frankly provide access to lower cost alternatives because as you well know healthcare costs too much and consumers are seeking more affordable options.","We\u2019re still reviewing the association health plan rules at this time and we\u2019re not going to speculate on the potential outcomes of regulatory matters. But I would remind you that we have significant experience and do offer association health plans today, primarily in our individual business and\/or operate in markets like PEOs and others that have similar characteristics. What\u2019s important about these is they must be designed carefully in order to enhance coverage options and to ensure that they don\u2019t destabilize other aspects of the insurance market, like the small group market. So that\u2019s largely where our commentary will be aimed, is making sure that there is no unintended consequences of these.","And then with respect to enrollment in the first quarter, Jeff, can you touch on that please.","Jeff Alter","As you saw, we had another strong quarter of growth at the end of 2017 and that makes a run of 13 consequence quarters of strong fully insured group growth. When you look at 2018, our outlook that is unchanged from our investor conference has a market dynamic that has the introduction, full introduction of the health insurer tax. And that\u2019s resulting in much higher premiums and quite frankly, much higher year-over-year increases for our clients.","So with that in mind, we look at our very large one-one enrollment in our larger business. We continue to see small group growth and we believe that as the year paces, we will return to growth in that the remaining three quarters and continue our run of strong growth.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Zack Sopcak","Just wanted to ask quickly about your MedExpress Walgreens collocation highlight, I think you\u2019re at about 15 sites at your Investor Day. Curious how that\u2019s going and how you think about in your perspective what metrics you have to see or think about a broader rollout for United and Optum? Thanks.","David Wichmann","I know this has gotten a lot of attention here, in particular, over the course of the last week or so with some activity at the JP Morgan Conference. I want to keep this into context. We have about a dozen or so locations that we brought online throughout 2017 and that was really to see whether not a retail side of service in this case with Walgreens would be an attractive venue for care delivery.","The results are not near final but we\u2019re hoping that our MedExpress surgical care model with an adjunct pharmacy performs as good or better than without meaning that we can provide more convenient service to consumers at a lower cost and with very, very high levels of quality as MedExpress had as reflected in their NPS scores from consumers. I also want to put into context in that and this is just part of developing an overall higher performing local health systems. So it just be one component that maybe nested inside a local care delivery market with ambulatory surgical capacities and house calls and things of that nature.","This is the future health system that we see delivering considerable value to people. The other thing I just want to emphasize is that we\u2019ll evaluate other venues and partners as well. This is an exclusive to any one, in particular, our interests are being able to line as productively as possible with others in these local communities to see if we can deliver additional value to people.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte","So on the providing side of the house, wanted to see what your thoughts are on your organic strategy and M&A. And firstly on the build out of the Optum care into 35 and then into target 75 markets. What type of competition are you facing with either other plans or private equity or other health systems? And how do you become the acquirer of choice? Obviously, you did get the DaVita asset.","David Wichmann","I think we\u2019re nicely positioned initially here, but we\u2019ve got a long ways to go. But I wonder if we -- over that for Andrew, Andrew Hayek","Andrew Hayek","So first and foremost, we started this strategy to build out Optum care in high value ambulatory care networks several years ago. And so we\u2019re several years into the strategy. The addition of DMG is another step forward in that process. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity to combine with DMG. And I would also remind you that we\u2019re in the midst of an approval process that\u2019s underway. And the step forward for us allows us to combine DMG\u2019s outstanding clinicians, local leadership and national leadership. They\u2019ve achieved very strong results in Stars, clinical outcomes and patient experience. And our capabilities and our strategies are very complementary. We anticipate that many of DMG\u2019s capabilities will make Optum care stronger. Reciprocally, we believe we can add a lot of value to DMG. And by doing this, we enhance the value we provide into the markets we serve.","More broadly, the markets that we are targeting and entering have been and remain competitive. We earn the right to partner with medical groups and IPA, and surgery centers and ambulatory care centers through value. But we need to demonstrate our ability to enhance clinical outcomes, the patient experience and reduce the overall cost of care. And that is true across Optum care in each component parts. So we earn that right to partner and we think as we continue to grow and enhance our capabilities, we become a more and more attractive partner.","And now that we have the ability to combine various ambulatory care assets with the medical group and the IPA, we can address a broader spot of healthcare needs in the marketplace and become an even more attractive partner overtime.","David Wichmann","So Ana, very good question, one of five key areas for growth in the future this one, very early stages. Again, it feels like we are assembling relatively quickly, but it's one thing to enter into the markets and other things to apply information, technology and really enable these health systems to be strong performers and make a difference on the cost and quality, consumers receive in those market. So more to come over the coming years on this strategy as we continue to roll it out. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frank Morgan","For several quarters now, you called out the growth in the behavioral health services as one of your drivers of growth inside of OptumHealth. I was curious if you would give us any additional color on that growth area. What specific services, the in-patient out-patient and what in particular markets, is it more of a government or Medicaid product? And then wanted just a clarification, I think you said of surgical care affiliates 7% growth. And I want to confirm is that organic and then also if you could break out price versus volume? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Frank, thank you. That is a same-store growth rate as we described, but Andrew oversees all those businesses. Andrew Hayek?","Andrew Hayek","I will start with SCA, so the 7% is our same-site net patient revenue growth, so that\u2019s how we measure organic growth at SCA for several years. And so that\u2019s the combination of volume and rate. Keeping in mind that a total joint replacement could take couple of hours and reimburse $20,000, pain injection could take 10 or 12 minutes and reimburse less than $1,000. So we use same-site revenue as the organic growth measure. And 7% is a very strong number, that\u2019s the high end of the range that we have grown over the past several years, and is a reflection of the cumulative impact of the strategy we pursue, partnering with health plans and medical groups and health systems, being very disciplined in shaping our portfolio, the right M&A as well as some strategic dispositions to make sure are in the right markets, focusing on high acuity procedures, ramping up total joints, cardiovascular, complex spine, et cetera. So we\u2019re very pleased with the 7% same-site growth rate. And as Dave -- as was mentioned in the script, we continue to grow our SCA portfolio.","On behavioral health, we\u2019ve had strong performance across the board and that\u2019s including our medical expense, our ability to serve our consumers, including the growing needs in autism and substance abuse disorder. And so really we feel very good about our product and our presence. And we continue to ramp up and add external customers and grow in virtually each of the segments that we serve. So we feel very good about the behavioral, the trajectory we\u2019re on and the prospects for 2018.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah James","Can you speak to the OptumCare ASC surgical trend environment? So how is the trajectory going this year versus in the past? Are you seeing consumerism impact total annual surgical demand, or is it just back-end loading and changing the location of service? And taking that one step further. Do your systems allow you to see impact of in-patient diversion for non-UHC members? In the past, you\u2019ve said that you could track this on the individual member basis on the insurance side. But I am wondering for the submarket of OptumCare\u2019s ASC, can you tell how much of that volume was diverted from in-patient or does this data and technology not currently exist with that?","Andrew Hayek","I would say from a wide lens, stepping back that ASC environment, certainly fits into consumerism. And so over the past several years with rising membership and high deductible plans, consumers being more aware of various alternative sites of care and having more financial responsibility for the cost of their care; we study this; we hear it anecdotally; patients are asking more questions; are asking questions to their physician; and they are searching more. And when they do, the ASC environment for clinically appropriate procedures is at very attractive site; based on quality outcomes, based on the patient experience, we have a Net Promoter Score of 91, as well as the cost effectiveness; procedures in our setting of care are roughly half to less than half the price of the same procedure in a hospital environment.","So we do fit very well into consumerism and we have some data as well as many, many anecdotes that affirm the consumerism does drive increasing interest in our sites. In terms of back-ended nature, the years have always been seasonal, that's due to the members and patients when they're at the end of the year and they have a deductible to spend. They would rather get the procedure done by the fourth quarter before the plans are reset. So there is nothing new or different about that trend.","And then in terms of in-patient diversion or share of the market that we're receiving, we work with multiple plan partners to measure this in various ways. We have a number of pilots underway with multiple health plan partners to track this and do a better job of capturing the right, clinically appropriate procedures. We're making progress. We feel very good about it. And we're still in the very early days. There is still a lot of opportunity to think about higher acuity procedures, like total joint replacements, complex spine, cardiovascular procedures. So we're very optimistic about what the future holds.","Operator","And we'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold","OptumInsight backlog $15 billion, uptick nicely in the quarter. And could you talk about the specific areas where you're really seeing traction in OptumInsight? And where that backlog is really building?","Eric Murphy","To your point, we added $2.4 billion to our backlog during 2017. In Larry's opening comments, we shared, that\u2019s 19% year-on-year growth. So we're pleased with that performance. We had a strong Q4 in terms of sales, which enabled us to achieve the $15 billion objective. For Q4 sales, the primary contributors to that backlog came through our state government business, as well as our ambulatory rev cycle business. In terms of the path forward, we take a very robust pipeline into 2018, which should help us achieve our $17 billion to $18 billion guidance that we provided to you during the Investor Conference.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa","My question is on your guidance. Well, I appreciate very much that your guidance changed only includes tax reform items, so that makes easier for us. But the fourth quarter looks like it was running ahead of your guidance. And the fact that you even called out the UHC was ahead of your own expectations in the fourth quarter. So why aren't there other changes to guidance going forward? Or does that imply that you're more comfortable at the top-end of the range now or were there some negative things that we should be thinking about that came into play during the quarter?","David Wichmann","Well, Peter I think really what it's reflective of is we're maybe 45 days from the time that we had our investor conference and first led out the depth of our initial guidance. Overall, we're quite pleased with the performance of the company and how it's advanced to the balance of 2017 and how it's established itself nicely for 2018 and beyond. At this instance, we didn't think it was appropriate or necessary to reflect any additional guidance changes based upon the core performance of the business. Let us get through a quarter or two here and we'll reevaluate what our expectations are for 2018.","Peter Costa","And what was the prior period development in the fourth quarter, if you don't mind?","John Rex","I think it was $200 million.","David Wichmann","So thank you Peter. To wrap up, in 2017, UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered quality products and services, practical innovation, a better consumer experience and increasing customer satisfaction. Financial performance was strong, marked first and foremost by distinguished and diversified growth, meeting or exceeding our outlook by virtually every measure, including revenue, cash flows and earnings.","We have carried this momentum into 2018 and expect to continue to improve quality and MPS scores and build greater trust and loyalty, enabling continued growth for many years to come. Thank you for your interest today.","Operator","And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning to review our first half 2013 and the longer-term future we continue to build at UnitedHealth Group.","The performance of the quarter and the first half of this year reflect many of the themes we are focusing on with intensity across UnitedHealth Group: growing by serving more people with higher and more consistent quality with compassion and a better, more modern and personal consumer experience; making health care more affordable by enabling the health care consumer, the care provider and the system itself to become a more effective system of health and wellness; advancing the performance and value of this enterprise for shareholders through operating and capital disciplines in both growth and strategic diversification, as well as dividend and share recapture.","We see several of these elements in our first half performance in a number of ways such as the consistent, broad-based growth across each of our market-facing business groups; medical cost trends that have remained in check and will help to keep health benefits affordable; the increasing pace in product innovation and adoption as nearly 6 million consumers now embrace our incentive product design and our rapidly growing portfolio of consumer tools; the rapid acceleration of deeper and more integrated performance-based payment relationships with care providers that will reach above 25 billion by this year end; and the increase in our dividend to more than $1 billion annually even as we sustain $3 billion in share buyback.","We have a great deal more to do. We are far from performing to our potential. Although we are seeing steady advancements on many fronts, we are redoubling our commitment to consistent execution in the core fundamentals of our businesses. We are determined to accelerate the pace of innovation and the adoption of simpler and more modern approaches and technologies and ever better approaches consistently delivering higher-quality care and access and to make health care more understandable and affordable for both the individual consumer and for our society.","Our performance in the first half of 2013 was characterized by this growing business momentum, continued service expansion and diversification across the enterprise.","In the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.40 per share, up 10% year-over-year with revenues over $30.4 billion, up 11.5% year-over-year. As expected, the consolidated operating margin decreased slightly year-over-year by 30 basis points as the consolidated medical care ratio increased to 20 basis points to 81.5%, reflecting our continued strong growth and diversification into government benefit programs. And accelerating growth from our services, international and fee-based businesses produced a 90 basis point rise in the consolidated operating cost ratio to 15.9%. The level of services growth has become so meaningful that it continues to outstrip steady efficiency gains from our multi-year initiatives enhancing quality, simplicity and system-wide productivity, as well as our concentrated focus on cost management across UnitedHealthcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group.","While this ratio has increased, it remains largely a reflection of the ongoing growth and diversification across UnitedHealth Group. Cash flows from operations were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $2.5 billion through 6 months. We decreased our debt-to-total capital ratio by 160 basis points during the quarter to 34.6% at June 30 and ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in available cash.","Last month, our board increased our dividend by 32% to an annual rate of $1.12 per share and renewed our share repurchase program with a fresh authorization for the repurchase of 110 million shares. These decisions reflect confidence in the strength and consistency of our underlying earnings and cash generation capacities into the future.","In the current quarter, UnitedHealth Group continued its pattern of steady, consistent growth and market share gains, and we see more growth to come in the next few years in areas such as commercial and consumer benefits through public and private exchanges, Medicare Advantage, state Medicaid expansions, Medicaid long-term care, dual-eligible MMEs, military and veteran benefits and services, the emerging Brazilian market and the continuing maturation of Optum's broad range of services for consumers, care providers, payers and other participants in the health system as a whole.","Let's review second quarter business results, starting with UnitedHealthcare where the story remains one of remarkable growth and continued market share gains. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has been the fastest-growing health benefits company, increasing the number of people served by more than 9 million. This includes more than 2.9 million people in TRICARE and another 4.7 million people from Amil in Brazil, both new markets for us. Overall growth has been driven by offering distinct and innovative consumer benefits and services shaped to respond to local market needs and affordable price points for consumers.","UnitedHealthcare has designed a comprehensive system of capability that aligns modern, incentive-based benefit designs with easy and convenient consumer empowerment tools that engage effective clinical care wellness programs, which in turn channel naturally into incentivized, performance-based care delivery access. This aligned system leverages better informed and incentive consumer and care provider behaviors to produce sustainable cost and performance advantages and deeper, more innovative relationships with consumers, care providers and plan sponsors across all market segments. Effective incentive alignment with consumer benefits through the care provider rewards is a critical component to sustainably improving broader accountability and effective payer to care provider integration.","We are the market leaders in consumer value plans with nearly $6 million high deductible or consumer incentive plans in force. We are leaders in consumer transparency tools with innovative mobile applications that enable effective use of information specific to each consumer. We're further along in value-based care provider contracting than any other company and our pace is accelerating with more than $50 billion in accountable care performance contracts expected by 2017, if not sooner. These programs offer varying levels of integration with care providers, depending on their ability to affect health outcomes and assume financial risk. Year-by-year, these programs are helping transform how health care is delivered, paid for and rewarded.","This quarter, UnitedHealthcare's organic growth was led by the initiation of services for TRICARE in the West region for 2.9 million members in the military and their families. This is the first time this contract has moved to a new service provider in more than 15 years and we encountered challenges as we engaged in this complex and massive transition. We have learned from these initial challenges and regret any disruption this may have caused to men and women we are privileged to serve, and we're deeply grateful for the collaborative working relationship with the Department of Defense, the TRICARE Management Activity, the TRICARE Regional Office West and the surgeon generals of the respective services, the military treatment facilities and their fine leaders.","Having quickly advanced from these initial challenges, we remain committed to consistent excellent service and the value of innovation in going forward for these programs.","UnitedHealthcare's Employer & Individual business added a net 235,000 people year-to-date and is performing strongly across-the-board. Growth continues to be strong across the government benefit markets as well. Through the first half of the year, UnitedHealthcare remains the largest, and once again, fastest-growing Medicare Advantage participant. And Part D and Medicare Supplement both continued to perform strongly. Medicare Advantage products have grown to serve 355,000 more people through the first 6 months, and our full array of Medicare product offerings has grown to serve over 1 million more seniors this year.","Medicaid growth stands at 110,000 people through the first 6 months despite a divestiture impacting 60,000 people earlier this year. Care for chronic and complex populations remains a distinctive capability for this business and a major forward growth driver with recent awards to serve long-term care and dual-eligible beneficiaries in Arizona, Florida, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Washington State.","For the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare generated operating earnings of $1.9 billion with solid contributions from all businesses. The commercial medical care ratio improved 10 basis points year-over-year. We are performing slightly better on outpatient costs despite the continued migration of clinical services from inpatient settings. We continue to experience lower hospital inpatient usage as we expected, and inpatient costs are in line with our projections.","Overall, 2013 full year commercial cost trends are tracking in line with our initial projections of 5% to 6% with unit prices remaining a core driver of increases.","UnitedHealthcare's results include Amil, which is now 90% owned. With Amil, our international business has grown to serve 260,000 more consumers in the first half of the year, remain solidly ahead of its growth and financial plans for the year and is well-positioned to continued growth and market share gains, driven by its distinctive market offerings and clinical engagement model.","We continue to be gratified by the growing response to Optum's market-leading offerings and capabilities. Each of Optum's businesses posted double-digit top line gains. And overall, Optum revenue rose 21% over last year. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 6.1% despite the increasing mix of pharmacy services revenues. As of today, we are more than halfway through our pharmacy migration. And since January 1, OptumRx serves a total of about 8 million new consumers, including these migrations and new business.","For the first 6 months of the year, total Optum operating earnings rose 80% to just over $1 billion. Optum's strong first half 2013 performance is proving that the broader health system and its constituencies create a natural end market for services, a market we have sized at more than $500 billion annually.","Historically, this market has been fragmented and served primarily by smaller single-point solutions. We see the opportunity to bring together the services and capabilities we offer and provide broader, more integrated solutions to larger, more diverse clients while continuing to deliver even more effective stand-alone products and services to our traditional customer base.","We are focusing our investments on roughly 10 product families and freeing up resources through this more disciplined focus and the related productivity gain to fund further development and innovation on behalf of the clients and consumers we serve. These actions are driving stronger and more consistent margin performance across all Optum's businesses.","The collective performance of our diverse UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses ultimately comes through in UnitedHealth Group's strong overall results. As we indicated earlier in our commentary, UnitedHealth Group consolidated revenues grew 11.5% and net earnings grew 10% to $1.40 per share in the second quarter.","We expect full year 2013 net earnings in the tighter range of $5.35 to $5.50 per share. Our second half earnings performance will benefit from the timing of Part D earnings and contributions and Optum's continued performance gains. Our balance sheet is strong and our cash flows from operations are expected in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion this year. We already targeted returning up to $4 billion of that to shareholders, and our recent dividend increase now puts us in an annual dividend payment pace of more than $1 billion.","Looking forward, our outlook remains consistent, strongly positive in the long term with familiar near-term challenges coming in 2014 and 2015 as we indicated last quarter.","We expect pressure on the pace of revenue growth next year, given both rate and membership pressures in Medicare Advantage. We see further business and product integration advances, further medical affordability gains and intense focus on driving lower operating costs to improve and sustain our competitive positions serving key health benefit markets and continuing strong cash flows.","The next phases of the Affordable Care Act should bring growth and expansion in the Medicaid business, as well as to Optum and some meaningful financial challenges as well. For instance, on the Medicare side, the challenge is intensified meaningfully and include nondeductible taxes combined with the continued significant underfunding of Medicare Advantage. We remain committed to Medicare Advantage as the most valuable and fastest-growing Medicare benefit offering available to American seniors.","By 2016, Medicare Advantage will, in effect, be reimbursed at parity with original Fee-for-Service Medicare. And at the same time, it will continue to deliver better benefits at lower costs because of effective medical cost management and far better consumer-focused services and technologies, none of which are present in the current Medicare Fee-for-Service system.","2016 should represent a final baseline pivot for Medicare growth for years to come, and America's demographic trends are compelling. Well more than 3 million people will enter Medicare each year, and UnitedHealth Group is uniquely positioned to emerge as the market leader. These long-term growth trends informed our approach to our 2014 Medicare bids, which will remain under review by CMS through the summer. Our decisions for 2014 focus on balancing program sustainability, margin protection and cash flow generation of our MA business measured on a long-term multi-year basis. We are aggressively and consistently addressing the operating and marketing costs of our Medicare programs without compromising the exceptional support and services we offer to the seniors we are serving through these important benefits.","The depth of the underfunding of these benefits to seniors is causing us to exit certain market areas, reduce the number of plan offerings and reduce benefits in the majority of the local markets we serve commensurate with our review of the competitive position and long-term sustainability of our services for each individual market.","We are shaping our networks to ensure we are delivering health care with local care provider partners who deliver high-quality care and provide a sustainably low medical cost structure and to increasingly share in the results of collaborative efforts to bring greater quality and consistency of care to seniors, including the most elderly and those with chronic conditions.","These steps can be expected to moderate member growth in 2014 in contrast to our strong growth experience over the last few years. We will engage our members further by increasing our use of in-home health reviews and in-home services. Even with these actions, we expect pressure on 2014 Medicare Advantage margins. The severe underfunding of the MA program for 2014, combined with the ACA tax impact and continued sequestration effects are too significant a burden to ask seniors to bear alone and still expect this important franchise to remain attractive to them.","Beyond Medicare Advantage and some remaining unknowns focused around ACA implementation in the individual and small group markets, we expect the general narrative of UnitedHealth Group's performance for 2014 to be largely the same as 2013. Our commercial benefits, international, Medicaid and military businesses should all continue to perform well. Optum will continue to grow strongly and contribute comparatively more of our overall performance as virtually every Optum business and product line is growing and performing well and is expected to continue on that path.","We will continue to be good stewards of shareholder capital, continuing to balance investments across our businesses and returning more capital to shareholders in both dividends and share repurchase.","From 1999 through the end of 2013, we have returned more than $40 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase even as we have grown and enriched the capabilities, the market positions, the value and the forward potential of this enterprise.","We remain optimistic about our capacity to serve society and to create value for the people and customers we serve as well as for the health system at large. And we look forward to an expanding discussion of our strategy, growth and performance at our investor conference, which this year will be on December 3 in New York.","As usual, this morning, we have a full complement of leaders here and would ask the operator to open the call to our questions. Only one per speaker, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just ask a little bit more about Medicare Advantage. You made a comment, if I heard it correctly, about final baseline EBIT in 2016 as a base for growth once we're fully at parity. Did I hear that correctly? And do you -- are you implying that EBIT is -- in Medicare Advantage is down from -- on a downward slope in '14 and '15 and then normalizing in '16 and growing from there?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, well, I'm glad you asked the question because I don't think that if it went out that way, that's not what our intent was. Basically, continued funding pressures, some of them mechanical, the impact of the ACA and so forth will continue basically to get the funding mechanisms for Medicare Advantage to be at parity with Fee-for-Service. Once that funding is leveled at that basis, the programs are thought to then be neutral to each other from that perspective. And therefore, one could expect, given the strong performance of the Medicare Advantage program, that the growth could even accelerate from that point because you've got this significant demographic trend. You have a very attractive program, and the Medicare Advantage program will still have meaningful advantages in terms of benefits, medical management capacities, consumer engagement and relationship capacities that the Fee-for-Service system simply doesn't have right now. So that's why I think our outlook on Medicare Advantage in the long term is so positive because, in essence, we have to navigate through these next couple of years where some of the mechanical funding actions will take place. But even in those periods and those have been, in my view, in effect, Medicare Advantage has continued as a broad national program to prosper and grow. So I don't know how it will play out in 2014 and '15 as these elements play in on the funding -- to get funding in essence to neutrality. But from 2016 forward, that neutrality should then baseline this program and it will be Medicare Advantage with its, I think, compelling advantages compared to the Fee-for-Service system. And we think the prospects for growth after that are quite compelling. That's really what we tried to get across.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that makes sense. You also characterized, in terms of next year, that the impact would be to moderate member growth for 2014. Do you imply by that, that you do expect growth but it's just at a slower rate?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, we really didn't comment on that direction. What we were intending to say is actions that we are taking to make sure that program is competitive and viable in as many markets as we can possibly continue to advance in. So along those lines, we outlined a series of steps that we're taking that maybe Jack Larsen wants to count on that. But again, we are focused on operating that program to its maximum potential in serving as many American seniors as we can through that program and making sure that it continues to perform in terms of growth, margin protection, cash flow attributes, et cetera, and to maximize the performance of the program, recognizing the funding pressure that's on and recognizing that there might be limitations to how much seniors can actually bear the underfunding actions that are being taken with respect to the program. Jack?","Jack Larsen","Thanks, Steve. I would just add maybe a bit of an exclamation point on some of the changes that we're contemplating for our business next year and I think Steve went through them well. We're looking at benefits. We're going to be adjusting our -- planning some market withdrawals, I think, at a more modest end, perhaps 5% or so, with most of those members having an opportunity to enroll in another UnitedHealthcare plan. We'll be narrowing our networks consistent with achieving better cost, better outcomes and better management of our stores [ph]. And Matt, we haven't really seen how our competitors are taking to all these, too. So I would say, at this distance, I think the only thing we can really say is that our performance at the membership growth line is likely to be more moderate compared to the last couple 2 or 3 years where we have grown very well.","Operator","And we'll go next to Justin Lake with JP Morgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, just wanted to check and see if there's any updated view you can share with us on 2014 EPS growth overall.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, Justin, we thought that question might come up. We don't really comment on next year's guidance in the current midyear quarter. I would say that with that said, earnings growth is clearly our focus for 2014 and we are intense about that. But we have to recognize that there is a great deal in front of us to achieve that. As we just mentioned, certainly strengthening Medicare Advantage given the significant 2014 funding shortfall and the steps we need to take to make sure that program continues to be vital is on the front of the list of that. There's also ongoing work in the commercial markets, with pressures on our own individual business, the continued market migration to lower price point insurance products and fee-based conversions. And those are all occurring kind of in the backdrop of a normal competitive dynamics intention. We remain respectful of medical cost trends despite the success in keeping trends in check, and particularly, given the measured economic recovery. We need to make continued investments in Optum in the emerging categories of private exchanges, Medicare risk and revenue cycle, house calls, ever larger and longer-term care provider relationships, Optum cloud products, and in general, we are committed to continuing to fund ongoing innovation and adoption. And then last, we want to think about headwinds. Investment income, we'll see probably short-term pressure as current portfolios actually turn over and transition from kind of capital gain realization mode into higher-yielding portfolios for the longer term. So with that series of headwinds in front of us, experience has taught us to be somewhat cautious and to be sure we consider and respond to these headwinds before we offer a sense of 2014. So we are not prepared to do that, but I would say we are intensely focused on solid earnings growth for 2014. But we have to work our way through that as we stand really in the mid-year of '13.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then my actual question was more of just a follow-up on Medicare Advantage. Just to make sure I'm clear on what you've laid out here is you felt like 2014 and '15 are looking like a -- obviously, you're going to be under pressure. But by the end of 2015 going into '16, do you expect that '16 growth to reaccelerate and you feel like you'll still, after all this pressure, given what you're doing from a cost perspective and managing, you're going to have -- and you feel like the benefits that you still have left out there for seniors after these costs will still be enticing and you expect growth to be in line with what you've seen over the last couple of years and potentially even accelerate? Was that a right -- was that the correct takeaway?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think you generally have it correct. I think you may have a more precise notion of it than we would having to operate the program. So I can't tell you that on January 1, 2016, that there will be some kind of a light will go on, et cetera. But you have exactly the direction of our thinking on this program correctly. That as we navigate through the next couple of years and the pressures that, I think, are well acknowledged on the program, we intend to operate it in a -- in such a way that we are maintaining the vitality of that program, protecting its margins, maintaining the vitality of its benefits and its distinctions to consumers, to seniors that need these programs and that we think that, as you reach that point of neutrality, which is about 2016, that the growth dynamics of that should accelerate, yes.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so do you see the program will be bigger than it is today or not -- or smaller than it is given the -- given what's facing you when you get to 2016? And that's it for me.","Stephen J. Hemsley","That's the third installment of your single question. Obviously, Justin, from that discussion, we expect in the long term that the needs of the American seniors and what the values we can bring to the Medicare program suggest that is a very strong long-term growth platform.","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just want to follow up on Medicare Advantage again and make sure. I understand what you're talking about in terms of reimbursement and the pressures in '14 and '15. But when we think about the business near term, particularly fourth quarter this year and how you market to seniors, will you take your foot off the accelerator somewhat in terms of marketing, or do you think you have to accelerate the spending this year to maintain what you have and potentially grow? And just if you could give us any context on how the suspending might change year-to-year, that would be helpful.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I might offer -- take it at my level that how we're going to approach and deploy resources to the market from a marketing point of view at this point in time is really a little, I would say, a level of competitive intimacy that I'd rather not share. I would say that our commentary was more along the lines of the fact that we are going to be shaping networks to be more focused, to really focus on the high-performance assets as it relates to seniors, that the benefit reductions that are fairly broad based, those are the elements that I think will play into more conservative growth prospects for '14. I think that getting into what our marketing plan is, might be a little bit more than we would like to get into this morning.","Operator","And we'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe I'll switch gears a little bit. There's been some developments, obviously, around the ACA since we last had you guys on the conference call, the employer mandate delays, some documentation delays and then we've also gotten some information on the exchanges in some states. I know you said you'd be opportunistic, particularly around the exchanges. Can you comment about, A, does any of those developments that have occurred in the last few months change your perspective on those opportunities that are available to you maybe looking out next year and beyond for the ACA?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think I'll have Gail and Jeff Alter kind of comment on that. I would just say, again, like to calibrate the perspective we're bringing to it. Long term, we're positive with respect to those channels as they form and as they became areas where we think we can participate and add value. The near-term dynamics are more challenging for us and maybe that's specific to our particular profile of business. So near term, we have tended to be more cautious with respect to those, and I think generally, the elements that have been occurring reinforce those tendencies.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Good morning. It's Gail Boudreaux. I think Steve hit on the core principles. We've been, I think, modest in our participation in the exchanges. But I think the biggest story, quite frankly, is there is significant change going on across the overall commercial markets. So as we think about our business, we're focused both inside and outside of the exchange around affordable benefit offerings for our consumers. So what we're talking about in terms of our network and our intentional integration of product, clinical and network strategies is really core to both what we're doing inside and out of the exchange. We're participating in about a dozen exchanges as you can see from what's been publicly disclosed. And quite frankly, at this stage of the game, we've kept a very disciplined process around that. We think that there is a huge opportunity over the long term, and we're going to participate to learn in those exchanges. In terms of what's happened on the overall reform implementation, at this stage, we're preparing our business. And as I said, much of what we're doing, we're doing for both inside and outside of the exchange because we think affordability and consumer engagement are probably the most critical pieces.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to understand a little better this year's guidance. You guys reported a quarter, which beat at least consensus numbers by $0.15. But it looks like you're only raising guidance by $0.05 at the mid-point. So wanted to understand a little bit how you thought about guidance. Is there anything that you thought of, in the back half of the year, that might be a headwind that maybe you weren't anticipating before, that maybe the market wasn't anticipating?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I don't think so, and I might have Dave comment on that. But in essence, we tend to operate within a range and feel comfortable in that range. I think excessive precision here is -- time has taught us to be careful about that and to, in essence, be prudent with respect to the guidance that's offered. I would say that the performance of the business has been strong through the first half and while there is -- the orientation of the business was more challenging to the second half, we are pretty much on course and had -- saw no reason to do anything other than tighten again the range of guidance.","David S. Wichmann","Right. So Kevin, it's David. If you kind of parse through this, the range of $5.35 to $5.50 per share suggests that the second half of the year will not only be stronger than the first half of this year, but also stronger than the comparative half year in 2012. And as we kind of commented on in the first quarter, that's largely due to the change in the seasonal pattern of Part D revenue and profit recognition. While -- Steve had it right, there's very modest pressure, additional pressure, on the back half of the year, I think we've already pointed some of these out. But just to keep in mind, obviously, the last half of the year has 2 quarters of the sequestration impact versus the first half of the year, we're only having one, as an example. And then, of course, as you also see, we have an uptick in a run rate of our growth patterns in the business as well. So that requires some investment, not only in terms of selling, but also in terms of implementation. And then Steve did mention the near-term impact on the higher interest rates than the impact that they have had on our ability to recognize the extensive capital gains that we have in the past. And then the last thing I'd just point out is our tax rate will return to 36.75% level for Qs 3 and 4, which will comparatively impact earnings in the last half of the year.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But I guess, except for maybe higher interest rates, none of those sound necessarily new, like new headwinds per se?","David S. Wichmann","No, I was just trying to give you some...","Stephen J. Hemsley","No, I just think we're just trying to establish a prudent, balanced, I think, consistent with what our posture has been for the last several years. And the businesses continue to perform well and Optum, in particular, is having a very, very strong year. But we didn't really see a need to change the guidance other than to tighten the range given the fact we only have a half year left.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just taking a look at the SG&A changes. It came a little bit higher than what we were looking at. I think you were up 20 basis points. The ratio was up 20 bps in the first quarter and now up 90 in the second quarter and I see the TRICARE piece of it. But I'm just curious what's driving that? Was there sort of -- was there any discretionary spending, any acceleration of planned spending that you thought would be coming? And maybe within that, if you could just give us a baseline to start with the TRICARE revenue contribution, that'd be helpful.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. Dave, you want to respond to that?","David S. Wichmann","Sure. So the operating cost ratio is up 90 basis points year-over-year. It was very much in line with our expectations for this quarter. We mentioned in the script that there are several things contributing to that ratio, predominantly related to business mix changes. As you know, we had one large funding conversion from risk to fee in the first quarter. That obviously will continue to impact us throughout the year. We've also added Amil, which has a higher SG&A ratio. And obviously, we didn't have Amil in the second quarter last year. TRICARE, of course, fee-based contract as well as continuing costs of implementation through the second quarter, again not in place last year. And of course, Optum is growing very quickly, and of course, most of that business is service-oriented and fee-based as well. The only thing I'd point out beyond that, which is all in the script, really, is there's continued cost of implementation for CPCA [ph], ICD-10, the TRICARE implementation and the PBM migration. Those are all items that are inside our numbers for the second quarter and those, for the most part, associated with improved growth prospects for the business going forward. So we're pleased to make those investments. The last thing I'll just say is that, as indicated in the script, is that, obviously, all these things have offset what this management team has done over the past several years. But in particular, in the last year around cost containment efforts and done a very nice job advancing the productivity of the business and really muting the impact of this mix shift on this operating cost ratio.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. I was looking, Dave, more just 1Q increase versus 2Q increase. It looks like there was just sort of a pickup in the second quarter. I understand a lot of the implementation costs and the funding conversion, Amil and the implementation. I know a lot of that was impacting first quarter as well. So was just curious what caused the 70 basis point increase and sort of the year-over-year in 2Q and trying to figure out if TRICARE was big enough to do that, and my guess is that fee-based business probably wasn't big enough to cause that change.","David S. Wichmann","Well, I don't think, if there's anything from our perspective that's out of line in there. I think it is the continued progression in mix. I think Optum continues to be a larger overall factor. And I'm not sure everybody can actually calculate the impact of that, but I think that is probably the largest contributing factor that the business -- that's all operating expenses and growing at a very solid rate. So I think it is, as we have analyzed, it is overwhelmingly mixed even the items in terms of regulatory and so forth, so basically in these numbers year-over-year and in them sequentially. So there is nothing in that, that we see out of line or outside our expectations or plans for the year other than probably an even higher level of performance on the part of our services business, which includes not just Optum, but also the fee -- the significant growth and continued fee-based businesses across UnitedHealthcare. That's where all their commercial growth has been.","John S. Penshorn","Josh, it's John Penshorn. Last November, we said 15.9% plus or minus 30 basis points. That range we affirm and that accommodates the accelerated growth in fee-based services Steve referred to.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you go over for us how OptumRx growth is helping the firm exactly? And we can see it on OptumRx, but some of the improvement bleeds over into the commercial side of the business. What portion is on the commercial side of the business and what portion is on in OptumRx itself? And then can you talk about the growth path of Optum Rx in 2014 and 2015?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. I'll have Dirk respond to that. I mean, it is perfectly in line with the OptumRx's agenda on synchronization and the impact it has extending to the total medicals costs. So Dirk, you want to...","Dirk McMahon","Yes, I think, well, let's start up by talking about the business. I think if you look, our RFP volume is up a bit year-over-year. And if you look at what we see, we don't see a lot of the business changing hands across the PBM space. But what we do see we're actually getting a little more than our fair share and our retention has been pretty good. So if you look at what we try to do, we try to, again, manage total health outcomes as well as our -- as well as improving the cost of care. And we do that, as it was with our synchronization approach, we bring all the data together and optimize the overall spend. So we think that, in addition to our specialty offering in the marketplace, is resonating very well.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So that bleeds to performance for UnitedHealthcare and its businesses, and obviously, for our government programs. So it does, we think, make us distinctive with respect to medical cost trends, with respect to that section of medical cost drugs as well as a growing and vital and more diversified PBM business that we think the potential, once this migration is fully digested and we can focus our full attentions to the external marketplace, I think the growth prospects of that can be quite impressive.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you quantify for us in any way how much of the improving MLR on the commercial side comes from bringing the Optum business in house?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I don't -- I think that we would be -- it would be too much of back-of-the-envelope kind of response. So we'll take that off-line and we'll kind of bring that kind of thing perhaps back in the next, in our next quarter. We'll comment specifically on the impact of that. I just don't want to shoot from the hip on something like that. So I think it's a very good question and I think we'll take it that way, if that's okay with you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","There is obviously a robust conversation going on with parties in D.C. around the sufficiency of 2014 Medicare rate and how that may influence 2015 budgets and rates. Can you give us a read on what you see as the current perception in D.C. of the adequacy of 2014 rate that, initially, it seems to like debut 2014 as more positive than you view it. So I wanted to see if the perception in D.C. has changed throughout your discussions with them. And if you could give us a read on the level of their receptivity compared to previous years to the information you're presenting on where rates should be going forward.","Stephen J. Hemsley","That is a -- that would be a challenging kind of conversation to have in a forum like this. I would say this in a very constructive way, that access to the administration, CMS administration, HHS and so forth has been -- has always been open and fair and constructive dialogue and conversation. They obviously pursue a variety of protocols in establishing the rate process. It is a complicated process. It's multi-faceted. So it's not really possible to have a single conversation about elements such as that. I think our positions with respect to the funding patterns on Medicare Advantage are well articulated and supported. And there is an open dialogue about that and that dialogue is occurring, in essence, all year long. So I do think it's an environment where the parties are working together. I think there is a recognition of the role that Medicare Advantage plays in the marketplace. And I would describe the conversations as very professional and productive. And I think we would have to leave it at that. It is not what I would characterize as some kind of contentious environment at all. These are extraordinarily professional people in the administration that are trying to administer these programs in accordance with the protocols that have been established into the best of their capacities. And we are having an ongoing business dialogue with them on this subject. So I think that's all we can really comment. And that happens in states as well, in Medicaid. It's just the nature of the market.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just wanted to make sure I heard correct that you're planning on exiting 5% of MA markets next year. And if possible, if that's correct, can you give us a sense of what percentage of MA enrollment that represents today? And then second, separately, just wondering, has the delay in employer mandate changed or would you expect it to change discussion at all with employers? I guess, it'd be helpful just to get a sense of how your discussions are going with employers. Is there more pushback? Is there confusion? Is there concern, et cetera? I'm just trying to get a broad sense of the appetite to make changes due to ACA near term.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. Let's take Medicare first.","Jack Larsen","Hey, Ralph. Jack Larsen. So the 5% does relate to our membership. And I really wouldn't call them market excess -- market exits as much as planned withdrawals. So about 150,000 or so of our members will be impacted by member withdrawals. But in turn, about 80-plus percent of those members will have access to another UnitedHealthcare MA product.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Ralph, this is Gail Boudreaux. There are a number of questions, I think, embedded around the employer mandate. So let me address that one first and if I get to your issues... In terms of, first, the delay of the employer mandate, we don't really think that, that's going to have a significant impact. Employers who currently offer insurance are going to continue to do that and that's been the course of our discussions. In terms of how our discussions are going with employers, there is a lot of change coming to that marketplace and the intense focus is around affordability, as I said earlier, not just on the exchanges, but across all of our customers. They're looking at value-based plan designs, getting consumers much more engaged, how they integrate clinical programs. So I'd say the real focus is around affordability of coverage and improving consumer engagement and making sure they have real value for the dollars they spend.","Operator","We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","The MA discussion is remarkably more bullish than I thought it would be and maybe that's why your stock is trading up so nicely because it would suggest that 2014 may not be as challenged a year as one might have thought. So I guess, the first question is, is that -- the first part of the question -- is that the correct interpretation that now that you've gone through all this, you've reaffirmed your commitment to the program long term, post-2016, which I think was the point of that discussion, that you're able to find ways to mitigate the impact on both the beneficiary and the company of what is a dramatic underfunding of MA? And then the second question I have relates to capital deployment. Given that discussion about MA, can you either -- give us a sense of where you see the most attractive segments of your market or new opportunities, be they international or existing opportunities like Optum, like commercial, et cetera, where you think are the highest, best use of the capital that you're not already returning to shareholders.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. First of all, very good observation, which I'd like to make sure we bring in-line. I think our view in terms of Medicare Advantage is really not different than we had indicated last quarter. We believe that program is severely underfunded for 2014. The comments that we're making, if you parse them are, that we are exiting certain markets, we're exiting certain plans, we're narrowing our networks across virtually all the markets, we are taking benefits down across all the markets. So those are not good things for American seniors who engage on these benefits. And those elements will clearly put pressure on both top line for 2014 on Medicare Advantage, an important program for us, and on the margins of that program. So to level set on that basis, that's I think what we said clearly. And we will work through those things. And we are absolutely intense on this program because we think it has a meaningful long-term value to American seniors and to basically the viability of the Medicare program, in total, going forward because it brings in market dynamics around the managing medical costs, around engaging consumers, around holding care providers accountable, elements such as that. That's a long -- that's placed to our competencies. It should be a strong, long-term market, so long as the program is funded appropriately. If it is not funded appropriately, then that -- those market dynamics will change. So I don't think anything has changed about that. We have just worked one more quarter through the tactics of how we will have to navigate through 2014. So to level set that, we are -- we see pressure in '14 and '15 on Medicare Advantage as a product. We're working through those. The program, in our view, has not been funded strongly in the past and '14 was very significant. It's a 750 basis point delta and what we see the cost of that program to be. In terms of allocating capital, we have a diversified model. And that strategy and diversification is a conscious one with the notion of allocating capital opportunistically across the spectrum of that diversified model. We see compelling opportunities and have in the Optum business. There are opportunities that will emerge, we think, in the benefits businesses. And we think that they will emerge over time as more pressure is brought into the overall health benefits marketplace. And we look for opportunities where we can deploy our 3 competencies around local care, market engagement, around information and around enabling technology in international settings. We found Brazil to be a compelling opportunity for that, particularly on our Optum services side. There's probably more market opportunities for us on the international side and we'll continue to look for benefits. But that is going to be probably more opportunistic because we don't see as many of those other than in Optum. I think Optum has a significant opportunity on the international side. We parse our investments based upon cost of capital return thresholds, along those lines, and recognize our responsibilities in terms of returning capital pursuant to dividends and share repurchase. So that's kind of the perspective and that really hasn't changed at all.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Right. So if I could just follow up then. If I'm going to interpret your 2014 comments, I think what I would say is beyond the challenges provided by MA, you see your capital deployment and all the other expertise that you bring to the table as providing the kind of balance perhaps to 2014, offsetting some of the negatives in MA would be the continued pace that you see in the rest of the businesses? And that the challenge in predicting 2014 for us is to balance the negative of the MA against the positives of the other business. The street is interpreting, I think, your comments as meaning flat 2014. And I'm trying to, from my perspective, I think you said balance one against the other, but you didn't commit to flat. Is that correct?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, we have committed to no position on 2014. I think beyond that, that what you're laying out is broadly the way I would -- broadly correct. And that is, we are positive about the other aspects of our business and our capabilities and we're applying them intensively to the pressure that is being put on the Medicare Advantage program that are still working through that. So we haven't declared on 2014. We are focused on growing earnings in 2014 and growing this business, that is our focus and our intensity every year. We have a lot to offer in terms of our diversified business model. And when we feel we have worked through this to the point where we can responsibly offer some direction to the marketplace, we will do that. But I think generally, you have the framework of it correct.","Operator","We'll go next to Ana Gupte with Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","So a lot of questions on 2014. I'm just trying to get a little more clarity on commercial and Medicare in 2013 as that's the baseline for all the headwinds that you will experience in '14. So on the Medicare side, in the first quarter, you had quite a bit of deterioration in your x commercial medical loss ratio. You brought up sequestration, enhanced Part D and some seasonal patterns of first quarter pressure and so on. It seems to have eased up in 2Q. I'm just trying to understand if it's because of Part D or you've actually done something to improve your base Medicare Advantage business and the potential margin deterioration that you've been experiencing, I think, in 1Q? Or is it prior period reserves or Amil or something else?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think we'll have Dan comment on it. Clearly, Part D is a factor in it. But I think it's not the only one. So Dan?","Daniel Schumacher","Sure. This is Dan. You have -- you had a lot in there. To Steve's point, absolutely, the biggest difference as you look sequentially, first quarter, second, both on a consolidated basis and in government programs and Medicare, obviously, is the Part D timing. In the first quarter, as you look year-over-year, it actually increased the loss ratio. And as you look at the second quarter, it actually decreased the loss ratio on a year-over-year basis. So that's the biggest swing item. But I'd also tell you inside of Medicare that we also have more favorable development than the first quarter and on a year-over-year basis and that's a little more concentrated in our Medicare business. And from the first to the second quarter in Medicare, we're seeing a little bit better performance on our new growth in Medicare. So those are some of the things that are influencing it with Part D being the most pronounced.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","So your view of your own base Medicare business and if you can split out Medicare Advantage and Part D, do you expect deterioration from 2012 or not for the full year '13?","Daniel Schumacher","On the full year, we expect our Medicare Advantage loss ratio to go up. Obviously, we have the significant reimbursement challenges as well as sequestration. And then working against that is our focus on clinical management and so forth. So -- but yes, in aggregate, we expect our Medicare Advantage loss ratio to increase on the full year. As you look at Part D, our performance is strong there. On the full year, our earnings will be up and they're up in large part due to the significant volume growth that we had in Part D. And obviously, the quarter-to-quarter progression is different. But in aggregate on the year, Part D earnings are going to be up.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","That's helpful. Then just the follow-up on the commercial side. You had a little bit of margin expansion in 1Q. You had cited the loss of a big, fully insured very high MLR count at the time. You're seeing a little bit of margin expansion in the second quarter. Your days and claims table have gone up by 1 day. All of you are on the hook for this tax for next year or so. Should we expect that either your reserves will strengthen or that your commercial underwriting spread gets better through 3 and 4Q as you build up for that tax burden?","Daniel Schumacher","On the commercial side, yes, we had a decline in our loss ratio again this quarter on a year-over-year basis. We are down 10 basis points. A big portion of that is, obviously, the large case funding conversion that we had at the beginning of the year. And that's being offset by the competitive market environment. We guided at Investor Day to a more than 1 percentage point increase in our full year commercial loss ratio. We've adjusted for that large funding conversion. And we still expect at the mid-point, about a 60 basis point increase in our commercial loss ratio on the full year. So full year commercial loss ratio guidance still in that 81.2% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think the question is really a baseline one. The commercial baseline for the current year is very solid, very strong. And it will then run into the challenges that you point out, that everybody will run into in the marketplace in '14 and '15.","Operator","We'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you roughly quantify the margin compression that you're expecting to see in Medicare Advantage next year? So roughly, are we talking 50 to 100 basis points or something bigger than that?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, well, first of all, we don't really get into margin at that level in the first place. And I think if I could do that at this point in time, we would have more to say about 2014. So that's what we're working through right now. And we have to work through them on a real basis through the specific markets. So I really can't offer guidance with -- at that level of precision, the mid-year of the current year.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, maybe ask it in a different way. If the headwind that you're talking about is 750 basis points, you talked about sort of the seniors' ability to handle adjustments to that, what would you view as being a reasonable amount that a senior could handle in terms of benefit design changes in a given year?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I have no basis to really speculate around that. Let me go back to a couple of things. If you think about it, that spread that you're focusing on, we're attacking by, in part, taking benefits down in a way that maintains the value and viability of the program. And it is -- it runs a spectrum across markets. So it's not like a universal thing. This is done at a relatively precise level market-by-market. Network shaping is also that. We have historically sponsored a very broad, very open access kind of market for our Medicare Advantage. We will be forced to narrow that. We are focused potentially on operating costs across-the-board. So those are the elements that we're really playing. And then, obviously, we are, as I said, we're operating in a way to maintain the long-term viability of the program. But my second point in there was protecting margins. The sustainability of the program has to be that it is one that returns capital. So we are protecting the margins of that program. And that is a market-by-market proposition relative to our set of assets in the marketplace, as well as the way the program is being administered by its sponsor in those markets. It's a complicated proposition, but I can assure you we are focused on closing as much of that gap as possible. And seniors are clearly going to participate in it, pursue the benefit reductions, narrower access. So none of these things, the underfunding of the program is not a good thing for American seniors who benefit from these programs. But we are trying to navigate that in the best way possible to preserve these programs [indiscernible] long term because we think it has compelling long-term growth aspects and value to the administration in terms of what it can do for Medicare.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowan.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Optum seems to be running generally ahead of expectations. Is there any change to the long term Optum objectives that you outlined at Investor Day? And you talked about international being a substantial opportunity. Where else do you see good opportunities in Optum?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Larry, you want to comment?","Larry C. Renfro","Christine, this is Larry Renfro. And I think you know that we put together a, what I'll call, a multi-year business plan back about 18 months ago. We call that One Optum. And when we did that, we wanted to make Optum a more potent solutions organization and we wanted to really position ourselves for the future. And at the same time, we made some financial commitments to you guys on the ROIC being 15% by 2015, a 6% operating margin by 2015 as well as doubling our operating profits so -- of 2011. So those goals that we set at that point in time we're kind of marching down the road. We are hitting those pretty well and meeting expectations and sometimes actually doing better. The initiatives around them are pretty much around simplification, reengineering, business integration. Really, the whole business alignment and we talked a little bit about the PBM. And in 2013, we have now started to pivot toward growth. And part of the growth initiative, and I forget the part of your question, is that we're trying to really have deeper, what I'd call, larger as well as significant relationships with our customers. And that's actually working fairly well for us right now as well. The other part of growth, as we've been talking about this today, comes from what I'll call new opportunities that surround us around this talk about Medicare rates and the pressure that's going on in the industry. So what all that does for us is cause us to really look for the future and we have to put certain development dollars, as well as innovation dollars in to make all this work. I would say that international would fall into that same category in terms of innovation and development. As we work toward doing a lot of these programs that we are doing today in the United States, we'll be putting them into Brazil. So we're confident that we have planned investments. We're balancing those investments with the growth, as well as cost management. But at this point in time, we would pretty much stand by the overall multi-year plan in terms of our guidance to meet or exceed the high end of the range.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So thank you, all. Once again, thank you for your interest in UnitedHealth Group today. We have had a very solid quarter and a strong year-to-date, both for UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and both continue to grow. Our performance trends are positive. I think it reflects in part the value of our diversified business approach and we remain intensely focused on the remainder of 2013 and on 2014 in the long-term success of the enterprise.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 21, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company's Web site.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We entered 2015 with momentum from a strong 2014 finish and with more growth opportunity and fewer impediments than we've encountered over the last few years. We expect the strength of our performance capacities to become more visible in 2015 and even more so in 2016 and beyond, as we begin to perform more consistently to the full potential of this enterprise.","In 2014 both top and bottom-line results exceeded the upper range of our original forecasts for the year. 2014 revenues grew 6.5% to exceed $130 billion and earnings grew to $5.70 per share despite material and well documented burdens from the ACA. UnitedHealth Group's performance in 2014 was highlighted by diversified growth, strong operating and medical cost management and continuing advances in service, innovation and enabling technology, positioning UnitedHealth Group to better serve more people and better respond to the demands of our evolving healthcare system in the coming years.","Cash flow from operations in 2014 exceeded $8 billion or 1.4 times net earnings, with fourth quarter cash flows more than $2.4 billion a strong 1.6 times net earnings reflecting the core strength and quality of our business and earnings. In 2014 we raised our dividend by 34% to an annual rate of $1.50 per share. We repurchased $4 billion in UnitedHealth Group shares and return on equity once again exceeded 17%.","As we take a more detailed look at 2014 results, UnitedHealthcare's revenues grew 5.3% to $120 billion. This past year, we experienced outstanding growth in Medicaid and better than expected performance across our Medicare portfolio, balanced off by challenges in the commercial and international markets as we entered the year.","Beginning with Medicaid, organic growth of more than 2 million people over the last five years, including an exceptional 1 million new members in 2014, reflects a decade of strategic and operational decisions that have prepared us well to serve this ever expanding population in the states that entrust us to administer these programs. The Medicaid market was the first created by and aligned for society's desire to expand care for the uninsured. We have tuned our medical management and consumer engagement techniques to address the needs and experiences of these consumers. Leveraging the in-market personal care approach we use today with dedicated on-the-ground resources embedded within the communities we serve.","Our footprint in the Medicaid market continues to grow. Now reaching states where nearly 60% of the Medicaid community resides. We combine a strong benefit value with deep trusting relationships serving the states and the people who rely on these programs and benefits. Today our community and state business is well balanced, serving people in more than 100 separate state programs, from children with young families, to duly eligible citizens with the most complex medical conditions. We continue to steadily grow serving Medicaid with about 60% of our 2014 growth from market expansion and approximately 40% from traditional sources. With year-over-year market share gains in existing programs and participation in new program launches. We expect to continue this pattern of broad-based growth in 2015 with revenues expected to grow 15% to 17% this year.","In the senior and retiree market, strong execution drove meaningful growth for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, which added 295,000 seniors in Medicare supplement products and 215,000 people in standalone Part D. In Medicare Advantage, seniors continued to value and choose the modern benefits and support services they receive from managed care. And as you know, sustained government funding shortfalls for Medicare Advantage have hurt seniors, cutting back their benefits and causing disruptions, as products and markets were withdrawn across the industry in 2014, including more than 150,000 seniors impacted by our 2014 market and product exits.","Despite this pressure, we grew to serve a net 15,000 more seniors in 2014, a small but hard won achievement. We\u2019ll be back to much stronger growth in 2015 as Medicare Advantage is expected to grow by 200,000 to 300,000 individuals. With Medicare Supplement continuing its long standing growth pattern adding another 250,000 to 300,000 people. As we will continue to serve seniors with our leading market position in Part D, we see an overall Medicare revenue growth rate of 6% to 8% in 2015. As expected, commercial and international markets were more challenging for us over the past year, but we believe this is beginning to turn as well.","In Brazil, we grew revenues by just under 9% in 2014, with revenue lift provided by pricing changes and efforts to expand our geographic presence. Price increases clearly pressured membership levels, but are consistent with realigning our products for a sustainable marketplace going forward and we expect stronger market conditions in 2015. At the same time, Amil care delivery system of more than 30 strategically positioned acute care hospital facilities and over 50 clinical practices continues to grow and perform strongly. We are advancing more modern analytics, services and technologies across Amil\u2019s unique integrated benefits in care delivery platform to better analyze and manage costs, strengthen fundamental pricing and improve operational cost structures. Amil has exceptional brand equity. People recognize the quality of Amil\u2019s hospitals and care facilities and consistent value its medical and general benefits offer. Overall we expect revenues at UnitedHealthcare\u2019s global businesses to grow 5% to 8% in 2015.","UnitedHealthcare commercial revenues retreated 4% in 2014. In 2015, they will increase and the year is off to a strong start. Consistent with the strategy, we shared with you over a year ago we participated modestly in the individual exchange market in 2014 with the expectation of more significant participation as the market matured. This year we are offering products in 23 state exchanges that are home to 54% of the U.S. exchange market population. This includes eight of the 10 largest exchange market states and 15 states, where we also offer complementary Medicaid plans.","We\u2019ve enrolled more than 400,000 individuals through individual public exchanges, with four weeks of marketing still to go. We are ahead of schedule reflecting the brand value and trust in the UnitedHealthcare name. Growth in UnitedHealthcare\u2019s small group and middle market group health business, benefit businesses is also better than we had anticipated in a competitive but generally rational market landscape. The self-funded Employer business is positioned for stronger growth and sales performance in 2015 as well, as we continue to consistently deliver the combination of excellent service and innovation, low medical cost trends and flexible customized approaches, valued by the sophisticated large multi-market customer.","Looking at the broader picture, UnitedHealthcare has consistently grown by offering differentiated value, service and execution to its markets. We\u2019ve grown organically by more than 8 million people in the past five years. We should grow to serve over a million more people in 2015, continuing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s track-record as the fastest growing health benefit company in the nation. We are confident UnitedHealthcare is positioned for continued growth including revenue growth of 6% to 7% in 2015.","UnitedHealthcare delivered strong operating and medical cost performance during the last year. UnitedHealth Group\u2019s consolidated medical care ratio continues to be the best overall metric describing medical cost performance across UnitedHealthcare\u2019s diverse benefits businesses. That consolidated care ratio of 80.9% improved 60 basis points in 2014, and we expect it to remain stable in a range of 80.8% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2015. Medical cost trends in the commercial business were in the 5.5% zone for the year, with great consistency and execution on medical cost performance across the UnitedHealthcare businesses. Hospital usage per capita was lower overall again in 2014 and was lower across each of the UnitedHealthcare benefit businesses.","Moving to Healthcare Services, Optum had a remarkable year in 2014 and is positioned to continue to perform strongly in 2015. Revenues grew by 25%, operating margins expanded to 6.9% and earnings grew by 32%, once again above the upper-end of our expectations for the year. Optum surpassed all of its initial 15-by-15 target, return on invested capital, margins and earnings all well ahead of schedule. In 2015, earnings are on pace to triple, since we embarked on the one Optum growth initiative a few short years ago.","The fourth quarter was exceptionally strong with earnings growth of 53%. It was also something of a milestone surpassing $1 billion in operating earnings in a single quarter for the first time. Throughout 2014, Optum increased the quality and depth of its strategic relationships in collaboration with clients and partners. It combined good solutions with good execution for the complex problems faced by large sophisticated customers. This included Optum\u2019s assistance for the continued advancement at healthcare.gov and several state exchanges during the year. The one Optum commitments to greater alignment, consistent performance and cross-business simplification continued to develop well and resonated with people and customers Optum serves.","A quick profile that each of Optum business looks like this. OptumHealth businesses are gaining momentum in the wake of investments made over the last several years. We expect strong growth in earnings performance in the year ahead. OptumHealth revenues increased by 11.9% and operating earnings grew by 15% in 2014, all while growing the numbers our practices operated and patients and payors served in the care delivery business. Today Optum servers over 2 million consumers through owned and affiliated physician practices. On the consumer side, Optum is aggressively deploying better approaches and new technologies for consumer engagement, health enrollment and personalized consumer service and support.","At OptumInsight, 2014 revenues grew 10.9%. Operating earnings grew by 21%. And the external contract backlog rose nearly 20%. OptumInsight\u2019s $8.6 billion backlog provides a clear indication of the future revenue performance and services. A prime example here is the unique Optum One analytics platform, which brings together a clinical, plain demographic and care management data to provide both backward and forward looking views of patient populations, which are ripped with a rich and distinctive clinical encountered data set of over 55 million lives and expanding rapidly. We expect to increasingly drive positive impact for care providers and the consumers they serve.","OptumRx grew revenues by nearly $8 billion or 33.2% and operating earnings grew by 67% in 2014 as benefits were realized from the transition of the UnitedHealthcare commercial pharmacy business. OptumRx won external business awards to serve well more than 1 million people in 2014 and is tracking to a similar level of growth in 2015. The secular trends toward more complex and expensive specialty medications play directly to Optum\u2019s strength in synchronizing and integrating medical and pharmacy benefits, providing uniquely personalized service. Optum is advancing this approach with UnitedHealthcare commercial customers in 2015 and expects to see further market interest in its capabilities in 2016.","Looking forward to 2015, our expectations remain consistent with those we shared with you at our investor conference in early December. We are off to a strong start with Optum pursuing large strategic relationships and the UnitedHealthcare\u2019s domestic medical membership, some 250,000 people ahead of our Investor Conference outlook as we close 2014 and with continued strength into early 2015 as we discussed earlier in our remarks.","For UnitedHealth Group, we are projecting high single-digit percentage revenue growth in 2015, with earnings growth potentially reaching the double-digits at the upper-end of our earnings range. Following established patterns, we expect first quarter earnings to decrease sequentially from this quarter but perhaps not to the levels reflected in current analyst estimates. From there we expect the second quarter to rise sequentially and quarters three and four to have smoother progression than in 2014.","We expect performance to further improve in 2015 in a number of key areas. And let\u2019s spend a minute on those areas of focus. We expect to grow at a very solid pace, capitalizing on market opportunities and commercial benefits, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the continuing momentum of Optum. Amil\u2019s performance will strengthen in 2015, led by balanced pricing to address medical cost trends and the use of new approaches, analytics and technologies to improve the total performance of both benefits in the care delivery businesses. We are committed in 2015 to growing, strengthening and deepening customer and consumer relationships at the enterprise-level across the UnitedHealthcare and Optum.","In this way, the breadth of services and capabilities can be dedicated to meet the needs of the largest and most sophisticated customers of healthcare from the federal government, to the U.S. military, to individual states, national employers, leading hospital systems, life science companies and to increase our focus on national health systems in other countries. This year we expect to significantly increase the number and quality of these important relationships that we are privileged to serve.","Excellence and consistency in operational execution will remain an important focal point, everyday, all year long enterprise-wide. Already in late-December and January, we quietly on-boarded over 5 million people to our newly developed rally consumer engagement digital health platform. And almost 6 million to Advocate For Me, our consumer support and service technology. And nearly 400,000 physicians are now served through our cloud-based link service platform with a goal to reach 600,000 by year-end.","We expect to further advance these and other next-generation consumer-centric healthcare tools in coming months, together with updates to our rapidly growing portfolio of mobile applications and cloud-based services, these technologies will serve to enhance and modernize our overall consumer and care provider experience in 2015. The key focal point within this area is our commitment to achieving four star or better performance for at least 80% of our Medicare Advantage customers by 2018 and 2015 is the year this work gets finished for 2018. We expect to perform well on medical cost for our customers, we deliver to our customers and members a valuable package of cost-effective network options and simple, useful information about quality and treatment choices supported by consumer outreach and effective medical management. In 2015, we foresee our volume of care delivered through value-based contracts exceeding $43 billion and as we help deliver improved cost and quality transparency.","In 2015 we will hold the strong financial disciplines. We expect to return capital to shareholders through a rising dividend and consistent share repurchase, while we maintain a discipline M&A outlook to further strengthen our capabilities and scale to benefit customers and consumers. Our brand equity and recognition will mature in 2015 with Optum and the UnitedHealthcare each refreshing their efforts to reach consumers and thought leaders across their health system. We spoke at the December Investor Conference about a fresh vocabulary for our enterprise, words like consumer and care provider value, precision and consistency in our work, simplicity, driving the last mile in the integration of data, services and transaction processes, rapid adoption for innovation benefits serving consumers and care providers, flexibility, adaptability and a more urgent pace of change. These things will become much more than words in 2015.","Every year brings challenges and 2015 will be no exception, how we meet those challenges will define the character of our enterprise and its leadership team. We expect to continue to build by focusing on serving our customers and serving you as our shareholders, all year long, guiding continued momentum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. We thank you for your interest this morning, and we will now return to your questions, just one per analyst please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) And we can take our first question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","My questions are on the commercial risk market, it certainly looked like membership stabilized in the fourth quarter here and Steve you talked about being ahead of plan early in the year. Can you expand on what is driving that change in membership trajectory and give us an update on the pricing environment in general? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure, I think this morning I am going to ask Dave to kind of take point on the UnitedHealthcare elements of questions. So, Dave you want to take that and then engage the team?","Dave Wichmann","I\u2019ll just maybe just make a couple remarks then I\u2019ll quickly turn it to Jeff. Thanks for noticing the progress we have made in the commercial risk market in the fourth quarter that carried over into Q1 as well and as you look at it, it is both on and off exchange and I think you\u2019ll hear from Jeff that we have very disciplined pricing as part of that as well, so Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Good morning, Justin. It's Jeff Alter. Yes, we had a really nice quarter in '14 and a really nice start to '15, primarily driven by our new products we have put into the marketplace in reaction to the beginning of 2014 in some of our challenges around price points. So, we worked really hard, tried to create products that were tied to network design and benefit plans that saw a different value proposition to many of our markets. We first began to see a churn in on membership profile around much better improved persistency of existing accounts, then we saw some of our value around affordability, helping our experience rated accounts and then as we moved into '15 I think our exchange expansion also helps create some additional products portfolio advancements off exchange that have been selling really well.","Your question around pricing, as Dave mentioned our pricing remains consistent and stable. I think that is also helping us as others are -- our pricing maybe a little bit to fix the shortfall in there, past pricing efforts and I think the market remains as stable as we have talked about, competitive and no real change to that portfolio of pricing across the various markets that we serve.","Operator","We can take our next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, maybe if I could ask you there to build on that and stay in the commercial market territory and maybe you can just tell us what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the evolution of the small group market, how much erosion if any you\u2019re seeing with coverage whether that\u2019s going to be exchanges or not? And then perhaps more broadly in commercial what you\u2019re seeing within group retention with the economy strengthening?","Stephen Hemsley","Jeff?","Jeff Alter","We, again '14 we were minor players in the exchange so we don\u2019t have a lot of information. I will tell you that I think it\u2019s well within that range that we have talked about over the last couple of years a few percent of that small group market eroding into the exchanges at least at this point. I think the growth in the exchanges both in '14 and in '15 are really driven by the uninsured and that expansion through the subsidy. So we have not seen a significant erosion of our small group business, just a reminder over the years that business has gotten to the point where roughly maybe 50% or 55% of those employers cover that\u2019s down from maybe 60%-65% in the 90s so this is going to continued erosion of that market over the years. I think you had a second question around our pricing environment?","Matthew Borsch","Well, it was really around the -- whether you\u2019re seeing some in group iteration, whether you\u2019re seeing trends stabilize and to what extent perhaps as a result of the strengthening economy?","Jeff Alter","Our in-group attrition has flattened that is probably due to the economy and then earlier in the year we did have some in-group attrition that was related to the ACA that has leveled off.","Matthew Borsch","Alright, thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","We\u2019re really seeing growth on the exchange off the exchange and in the self-funded marketplace too.","Matthew Borsch","Correct.","Stephen Hemsley","So we\u2019re really seeing pretty broad-based response to the offerings you\u2019re putting out in this point of time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Windley","Thanks. I was going to shift to Optum, Optum and in particular Insight had a really good fourth quarter margin. I wondered if you could elaborate on that for us and the sustainability of that. And then speaking about the Optum margin progression over the next few years toward the 8% goal?","Stephen Hemsley","Larry?","Larry Renfro","So Dave it\u2019s Larry Renfro, I\u2019m going to ask Bill Miller to participate in this question as well. So I think you probably recall that we had gone through our business plan this year from the start talking about how the fourth quarter would end with a couple of things going on. We had a great fourth quarter with the $1 billion in earnings that Dave talked about, but we were positioned for that quarter to have seasonality that\u2019s our 40-60 split on our business for the year and the planned investments we expected to kick-in and to start to pay-off and OptumInsight would be a part of that and that\u2019s Optum360. And then we had a third area of simplification and integration on our products and my comment on that is that everything worked as planned. We exceeded slightly the expectations we gave you at our December Conference. So we\u2019re off to a very strong fourth quarter and a great start. I would also say that the question on the 8-by-15 we were on target, we feel good about that. The momentum going into 2015 is very strong obviously for us, but it\u2019s also very strong for our number one customer being UHC. So we\u2019re still firm and the ways that we\u2019re good with the 8-by-15. Bill any comments on Insight?","Bill Miller","Yes, obviously it was a very strong quarter and I think it sets us up very well for '15 and beyond at backlog growth I think there is clearly a recognition that a few of the key things that we\u2019re bringing to the marketplace and have invested in are maturing, there is acceptance for example of the 360 side of our business which we talked a lot about which is our revenue management platform. We\u2019re well on our way to the customer acquisition that we target, but more importantly and what\u2019s exciting is the results that we\u2019re generating for our clients are starting to come through in terms of their financial and operational performance. We\u2019ve made investments in data and strengthened our hand particularly from a clinical data standpoint that has clearly differentiated us. We had a record quarter and expect another record year with sales, new client acquisitions and revenue from our data differentiation both in the provider marketplace and in the life sciences arena as well.","Clearly we\u2019ve added critical clients on the government side, working with several states on exchanges. And then finally I would say we\u2019re really happy with our entry into the physician management business, where we\u2019re going into practices, health systems, helping them turnaround and help drive better performance quality in their physician practices. We entered that market last year. We\u2019re very confident that that is going to be a strong contributor for the future of OptumInsight. And so all of those things combined together I think show a lot of diversity in what we do, a lot of areas to grow and feel pretty confident not only about 2015 but beyond.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","You put forth on the Investor Day a view of cost trend rising 50 basis points faster than it did last year, some of your competitors have put forth views of trend that's a little bit ahead of that. Why should we not be concerned of perhaps some of the improving view and membership on the commercial business, is it because you have perhaps underpriced that business? And specific to that in terms of cost trend can you talk about how your view on specialty pharma in particular Hepatitis C drugs, is evolving this year relative to last year?","David Wichmann","Okay, Peter it\u2019s David and you\u2019ve got a lot in there. I am going to have Dan respond to you, I will just maybe comment globally on our ability to manage medical cost and trend. I think it's no surprise that we have been able to create distinction there, vis-\u00e0-vis our competition for some time. We do a very good job of controlling utilization and an excellent job as well in terms of taking a full review of our cost structures and putting it into our pricing which is the discipline we've applied for years now and I think it's consistently produced good results. So Dan I\u2019ll ask you to comment further.","Dan Schumacher","Good morning, Peter, it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. So, let me handle first the medical cost sides, talk quickly about pricing and then a little bit on Hep C I think those are the three elements you are interested in.","Peter Costa","Yes.","Dan Schumacher","From a medical cost standpoint just kind of looking at 2014 broadly, we\u2019re very pleased with our medical cost performance. And in the fourth quarter in particular we again came in a little bit better than what we had expected and that's true in our commercial business, as well as in our government businesses. As we look at the utilization under that more specifically, that continues to be very well controlled, Steve did mention that again this year we were able to drive an absolute reduction in our hospital usage per capita, we did that in each business and that was the sixth consecutive year we've been able to drive an absolute reduction in hospital in patient usage per capita. So when we put that all together from a commercial standpoint our cost trend for 2014 came in actually a little bit better than the 5.5% that we had guided to at the end of -- at the beginning of December as well as the low-end of the range we guided to a year ago.","As we think about our trend into the future, we have assumed that we're going to see a moderate increase in utilization in each of our benefits businesses and that outlook is what informed our pricing, as well as our benefit planning. And I'll tell you with December behind us and the majority of January behind us as well, we're not seeing any indication or evidence of an increase in utilization. So we feel very comfortable with our forward outlook, commercial cost trend for 2015 is 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Sitting here today, we have 75% of our revenue for 2015 locked-in and the vast majority of that revenue comes from retained accounts those are customers that we have experience with and we understand their performance, so we feel very comfortable with not only our cost trend outlook, but also in relation to where we're positioned from a revenue standpoint in our commercial business.","Lastly you asked about Hep C. Obviously that's a category of significant focus for a lot of people as of late. In 2014 obviously we revised our expectations for cost coming out of the first quarter and I would tell you that we tracked very much in line with that over the balance of 2014. As we look to 2015 we do expect an increase in those costs in each of our businesses, we've reflected that and captured it in our outlook. So, we feel comfortable with where we are positioned.","Peter Costa","Can you give us some specifics on how much cost increase you expect in 2015 and precisely what you are doing regarding negotiating between the various drugs in Hep C?","Dan Schumacher","What I\u2019d tell you Peter is that we're constantly working to manage cost and drive greater value. In this space we're pleased to see competition. As we look at new product launches particularly in very high cost categories we have a very rigorous process, it's a process that evaluates the clinical equivalency of the drugs. We look at the effectiveness of each drug. We design clinical programs to ensure appropriate use. And then we obviously are looking at the PDL and formulary implications and then we're negotiating relationships that really drive the best value for our members and our customers. So, we don't talk specifically in this form about manufacturer relationships, but rest assured we're all over this.","Peter Costa","Thank you much.","Stephen Hemsley","So, Peter just to maybe to close that out, just to be clear and taking Jeff's comments earlier and Dan's comments now I think it's really our product positioning exercise that and possibly some firming of the market that's caused us to advance our business. The other thing I\u2019d -- so I think you can conclude that we're not under pricing the business. The other thing you can look at is our relative MTTR performance for the fourth quarter versus the full year. And if you look at that you will see that that we're performing better in Q4 than we did for the full year we have performed very well for the full year, but you can see some acceleration in performance as well. So hopefully that closes out that issue we\u2019re not surprising.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker","So if I\u2019m doing my math here correctly let\u2019s say you guys are forecasting about 19% to 20% growth in value-based care or care delivery on your value-based contract, maybe if you could talk about a little bit how that\u2019s split between commercial Medicare and Medicaid? And also how those value-based contracts are impacting both your enrollment, are you seeing outsiders enrollment in those products and then also around your expectations around cost trends? Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Okay I\u2019ll have Dan comment on this obviously it\u2019s a key area of focus for us to align incentives with delivery system really anchored on advancing quality of healthcare first but also improving the affordability of it, Dan?","Dan Schumacher","So your math is right. Yes we are expecting about a 20% increase in the concentration of value-based reimbursement. And going from -- we ended the year at about $36 billion of spend in value-based arrangements and we\u2019re looking to drive that north of $43 billion in 2015. And in terms of the underlying businesses, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in all three of our businesses, so I wouldn\u2019t highlight anyone individually. We\u2019re looking to make progress across the spectrum and across the benefits landscape. And we\u2019re seeing contributions to enrollment as a result of those relationships where we partner more distinctly with certain delivery system partners. And on the cost side, we\u2019re also seeing the outcomes there. We talked at the Investor Day, I know we had a breakout seminar to talk about driving 1% to 6% aggregate savings from our value-based reimbursement approaches, and then within that obviously the numbers can be significant based on how they\u2019re designed and as well as how tightly they are aligned around quality and performance and outcome. So we\u2019re very pleased with our progress there. We\u2019re focused on it in 2015 and we\u2019ll be in '16 and beyond.","Stephen Hemsley","I think it\u2019s important to note the orientation of the quality. And the fact that the structure actually drives volume towards the better providers that enter into these performance contracts and that we\u2019re progressing these contracts into more sophisticated forms where they\u2019re actually taking on even greater performance responsibility overtime.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Tom Carroll","It sounds like a very confident 2015 outlook. I wonder if you could share with us a bit more commentary on your operating cost ratio. Fourth quarter\u2019s result was relatively high, driven by the obvious, but do you think you see that improving in 2015 much like the rest of your business? And where should it go over the next three years? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Hey Dave do you want to address that?","Dave Wichmann","Tom, Dave Wichmann. So a couple of things, first our operating care cost ratio for the quarter was a little bit elevated at 125 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you know this is mainly influenced by the insurers fee which amps up that ratio by about 120 of the basis points, but what has been pretty persistent in our business is the mix has shifted more towards services. And when you see that mix shift, it tends to put a lot of pressure on this ratio. And so then that increases it even further and then our productivity efforts bring it back down and we\u2019ve seen productivity well managed across our business not only offsetting those impacts, but also inflation broadly. As we look to 2015, the same dynamics play out. We have a little bit of an uptick in the insurers fee, which further presses this ratio, but we also see continued growth in Optum and in our fee-based business overall which tends to press this forward as well. And then we continue to offset that with productivity improvements year-over-year. And we do expect the ratio to be somewhere around 17% plus or minus 30 basis points for next year. And we believe our running physicians supports that.","Tom Carroll","Thank you.","Stephen Hemsley","Next please, next question. Moderator, do you have another, we have answered all the questions this morning? So we may be having some technical difficulties we\u2019re going to. Hello?","Operator","One moment please, we\u2019re having technical difficulties.","Stephen Hemsley","Well, UnitedHealth Group is still here, I don\u2019t know about the rest of the world at this moment.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Christine Arnold","Optum360 and particularly for OptumInsight seems to be tracking kind of ahead of even what you were expecting last month. Is there any change to your Optum expectations relative to what we saw at your Investor Day? And then also what are you expecting in terms of margins on your individual memberships on the public exchanges? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Well that\u2019s an interesting combination question Christine. So I\u2019ll have Larry take the Optum side and then we\u2019ll respond to the margins on the public exchange business.","Larry Renfro","Christine I believe that we are right on target with where we planned to be right now with Optum360 from what I\u2019ll call the planned investment side, as well as the implementation operation. I think you know we have Dignity Health and NovaSure as two of our prime customers here. And nothing has really changed from the investor conference. We were positioning everything to happen in the fourth quarter just as it came through. I don\u2019t know Bill if you have any comments?","Bill Miller","No, I think much has changed. I think our business will depending on what happens with the ICD-10 changes this year, they didn\u2019t happen last year we overcame that, if they don\u2019t happen this year we are prepared one way or another, but I think we are optimistic and see certainly a pipeline that would lead us to believe that not only are we on target but we have got a chance to work ahead but I\u2019d say nothing has changed since the investors conference. And I would say just in terms of customer acquisition, we have always said kind of across our business that we were looking for these eight to 10 rich and deep relationships and I think if you look across all of the customers that we have acquired not only in 360 but beyond, we are halfway to that goal, and we feel very good about achieving that and certainly we don\u2019t see anything in '15 slowing us down to achieve that.","Larry Renfro","Christine, maybe I could it\u2019s Larry again, let me talk about the 10 relationships that Bill mentioned. We have named two, as we go forward some of our customers they do not like to be identified because of competition, and so some of the visible ways of looking at that half that we have right now would be to look at Optum360 it would be to look at our business in the government solutions area, and you could look at Optum One our data analytics area and you could look at Optum Lab. So there is some other metrics that I think are going to be important to look at from this customer acquisition standpoint. And I am going to ask John Rex maybe hit some of those metrics as well.","John Rex","Good morning Christine, John Rex here. So a few other things that we\u2019d looked at in terms of helping illustrate how we are progressing towards that goal of, be it larger relationships. The average, if we look at since the last couple of years average deal size within OptumHealth is up 80%. Revenue from our top-25 customers within Optum is up 2.4 times. The number of customers with over 100 million in annual revenue has doubled. We\u2019d point to external backlog going up nearly 20% and a pipeline that about doubled over the last year. So those are other metrics we look to, to help illustrate the impact that we are having and gaining these types of relationships.","Stephen Hemsley","I\u2019ll let Jeff respond to public exchange question.","Jeff Alter","Good morning Christine, it\u2019s Jeff Alter again. On in build exchange we built for our initial years to margin of 1% and 2% without any reliance on the risk orders, but we believe longer-term it\u2019s 3% to 5% business and like everything else well endeavored to be in the top-end of that range, as we go forward.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Just staying on the public exchanges, can you maybe give us a little bit of an update on how enrollment is tracking? I think you talked about it being in excess of 400,000, so just wondering if you\u2019d expect to sort of exceed the 400,000 to 500,000 range. Maybe if there is any disproportion in enrollment in any state that you are in? And then lastly recently in California, it sounds like you tried to get in statewide for 2016 but were denied, is the plan just to kind of revisit that in 2017 or are there alternatives you are seeking to still get into that market before that? Thanks.","Jeff Alter","Good morning Ralph, it\u2019s Jeff Alter again. So let\u2019s start with, yes we have had about over the 400,000 level in signups. We still feel comfortable within that range that we gave in at the investor conference between 400 and 500 by at this point I might think more around the 500 and depending on how the next week or so plays out, we could be that, but right now we feel comfortable within that range. The good news for us is we are growing where we said we would grow, which is growing a little bit more in some of those markets than we thought. So at investor conference we talked about some of the bigger markets where we thought we could grow and do well and that\u2019s where we are growing and doing well. So along with our plan that is where the growth is coming in.","Now obviously in California we are disappointed, we wanted to bring more choice and options to the residents, to California, we believe competition is good for them, unfortunately we were not able to get agreement from that Board to be in all markets, we did get granted a few markets where there are and as many carriers as they would like, we will -- we are reviewing that now so we might be in California in '16, but in a small handful of markets and we will go back in '17, we believe choices and competition are good for all markets including California.","Ralph Giacobbe","And you anticipate that you\u2019ll expand your portfolio markets in the next year?","Jeff Alter","Yes, outside of California we are working now to expand our footprint into the other markets that we happen to -- we didn\u2019t serve in '15.","Ralph Giacobbe","But you\u2019ll do that in measured ways, it's not all those\u2026","Jeff Alter","Yes we are reviewing those markets now we\u2019ll make some final decisions and let you know.","Ralph Giacobbe","The other thing that\u2019s nice is not only just selling right in the markets that you wanted, but you also sold the products that you thought would sell, right?","Jeff Alter","Correct.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Maybe just ask about the Medicare Advantage obviously you're looking forward acceleration growth I think 200,000 to 300,000 enrollment though was the target at the Investor Day it looks like in January with some of the open enrollment season in Europe 165,000 adds please comment on what you're seeing so far in the open enrollment season and whether that\u2019s really ahead of your expectations inline and any sort of qualitative comment about the market environment and then any early thoughts on the 2016 rate notice?","Dave Wichmann","It's Dave, I think we\u2019ve -- the team has done a nice job of really reestablishing growth in the Medicare Advantage individual aligned but -- and we have continued our very nice growth on the group MA front as well, but I\u2019ll ask Steve Nelson to comment overall on your questions.","Steve Nelson","Good morning A.J., it's Steve Nelson. Yes we are very pleased with not only how we ended the year but how we performed in AP. As Dave indicated, we drove really strong growth in our group Medicare Advantage business and I would say market leading growth actually, so really pleased with that. But we expect full year growth in our individual membership as well and that\u2019s particularly -- we\u2019re particularly excited about that because of the work we\u2019ve done with reshaping our network and you're seeing premiums broadly into our portfolio, and we are able to grow in the markets that were key to us such as Florida, New York and Texas and Southern California. So really off to a nice start and I would say also we\u2019ve saw some really good results and nice start to Medicare stuff as well. And across those two products really again off to a good start, good place to be, in fact maybe a little bit ahead of what we were thinking and so we feel really good about the ranges that we offered in last December and still get about those ranges.","In terms of the 2016 rates, there is a lot of variables that go into the final rate as you know and so you don\u2019t really speculate on that, but I will offer that our position has been -- that it\u2019s just a very successful and valuable program to seniors and it\u2019s had great results in medical costs and improving outcomes. Member satisfaction is up and the program is growing. So, we remain strong advocates for our seniors and their healthcare and we hope and expect that the rates when they are finally published will be fair and appropriate. Overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the positioning of our Medicare business and how we\u2019re heading into 2015.","Stephen Hemsley","We may have time for about two more questions. So, we could take a look at that, maybe two more questions. So next please.","Operator","Yes. We can take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Maybe just two on the MA side of things, can you talk a little bit about the stars and how your analysis of what stars has meant for enrollment in 2015, are you seeing better enrollment in the places where you have four stars, are you seeing real issues and competitors have really moved up on the stars in the individual side in 2015? And then also and obviously you\u2019ve grown group very significantly for 2015, do stars matter as much when we think about the group business or is that something that overtime you think that it will impact how group perceives the product as well?","Stephen Hemsley","Maybe I\u2019ll start on this I\u2019d like to make it clear that we believe stars matters and that we\u2019re focused on improving our performance in stars and I think we have been very consistent on that theme. It's not clear that, that has had really an impact with respect to how the product is marketed or acquired in markets, but we do believe that it is important -- overtime obviously important from a financial point of view, important in terms of our relationship with CMS who basically established those performance guideline. So, I want to make it clear that we are committed to stars performance but it\u2019s not clear and I maybe see Nelson to comment that that has had really a particular impact in terms of market response to product offerings right?","Steve Nelson","Sure. No, hi, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. You\u2019re right Steve stars obviously is a factor but it\u2019s one of many and it\u2019s very -- the benefit of planning processes is one that has a lot of factors in it and we take all those things into account as we look at the results that we\u2019ve achieved in AP that is very much in line with our expectations and stars doesn\u2019t particularly spike out as the core driver to any of those results again it\u2019s across so many factors and a lot of including your brand positioning, your brand strength, strength of the distribution, the engagement you have with providers and again that is how you design the product. So there is a lot of factors in there, on the group side stars is important it allows you to price competitively and our group membership has enforced our plans and so that adds to our ability to grow that membership and thus contribute it to that.","Kevin Fischbeck","Well I guess the question is, if 2018 feels like a long way away in many respects so do you think that you\u2019ll be able to go nicely even until you get to that target you don\u2019t need to get four stars to continue to go in the MA business in the meantime?","Steve Nelson","No, we don\u2019t. And one thing that really hasn\u2019t been mentioned this morning is that, we are clearly in the zone of our growth expectations for MA and we\u2019ve actually advanced premiums in a significant way and to basically to be able to go through that right Steve?","Stephen Hemsley","Right and so advantage is pretty impressive.","Steve Nelson","And I think bodes well because I think the large portion of establishing premium products in markets a lot of that work got done this year.","Operator","Okay. We can take our last question from Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin","I want to get back to the commercial business and I guess the question is just sort of about the landscape of employers, commercial employer contracts, basically what are they looking for in terms of products and then have you guys quantified the Optum impact whether there is a cross-sell of Optum products, or you mentioned Rally and Advocate For Me and a couple of these others, you\u2019ve measured this in new wins or higher retention levels and just broadly what\u2019s changing in that landscape where United is now seeing sort of that inflection point on commercial growth?","Stephen Hemsley","So I\u2019ll have Jeff respond to that, I do think that the content of the Optum product in the UnitedHealthcare offering clearly in the way in which supply clearly makes a distinctive difference, but has a lot to do with the way in which it\u2019s applied in the offering, but Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Good morning Josh, it\u2019s Jeff Alter. So I think again from most, everyone of our clients and employers in general this is a very important benefit for them to believe so they look for the value that can be provided, but it\u2019s also one of their more expensive items so they look for a partner who can work with them over the long-term to keep affordability in mind, but also deliver great products, service and innovation and that\u2019s when if you think about the combination of UnitedHealthcare and Optum together working in partnership with the clients and their consulting and their brokerage create that plan that works for that employer across sort of a very long time stamp. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver anything at any point for that client as their business changes and their dynamics change. We\u2019re able to bring in consumer products that Optum builds, obviously our close tie to OptumRx now that specialty medicine is becoming a cross-factor having the close relationship that we have with OptumRx to embed that inside the medical benefit is vitally important for the value proposition that the employer is looking for.","And then across the spectrum into OptumHealth our disease management wellness programs, our consumer engagements, employers have spent considerable amounts of money to have disease management wellness programs and are looking for more engagements and the work that Rally and OptumHealth does to go beyond just by creating an offering but actually get that engagement and get that uptake to keep people healthier and engaged in their wellness is vitally important. So I think what we\u2019ve seen is the marketplace has stabilized over the last year or so is that that view from employers looking for a longer term partner who can work with them to create an even more valuable benefit plan an offering for their employees but also be mindful of the cost factors that are involved in it.","Stephen Hemsley","Yes, something to really match the breadth of their offerings and the innovation dynamic and the reliability of continues innovation, continues focus on technology, so that you are building value year-after-year-after-year which plays a lot to the retention rates you have too. So good question and great response, so thank you very much for joining us this morning kind of to sum up 2014. UnitedHealth Group had a clearly a very strong year in '14 and momentum of the business grew throughout the course of the year, so that we ended the year perhaps, our strongest point and have brought that strength into the beginning of 2015 and through consistent execution and consistent focus on performance, serving customers, the people that we serve continuing to drive innovation, matched with a strong financial disciplines we expect our growth to accelerate in 2015 and beyond. We thank you very much for joining us this morning and we will see you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s program, thanks for your participation.

And I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information.","This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the Company's Investor page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 18, 2017, which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the Company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the halfway point of 2017, UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare continued to grow and perform strongly and we expect our performance momentum to carry forward through the balance of this year into 2018 and beyond. UnitedHealthcare has been a distinctive organic growth leader over the last seven years. During that same time Optum has emerged as the leading force for broadly enabling the healthcare industry with market leading data analytics and practical and innovative approaches to longstanding market challenges. These businesses are strong, stable, and exceptionally complementary to each other, growing and operating effectively while continuing to diversify naturally into adjacent healthcare markets.","With a socially sensitive global healthcare market constantly challenged and changing we see UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare built for that environment. Adaptable and creative, focused on the people and customers we serve, working with others and playing our role in leading and supporting progressive change across health systems. One important constant is our commitment to mission and the quality of our work, the positive experience and value we drive on behalf of consumers and customers, and their cultural bonds of integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation, and accountable performance we seek to bring to everything we do.","We are at home in the current environment. UnitedHealth Group is a different organization than we were just 10 years ago and you should expect us to be different still a decade from now. Society will continue to need and drive change in healthcare, we will continue to adapt and evolve with it and on behalf of it. We are committed to reaching the full potential that UnitedHealth Group has to offer, knowing the next 10 years hold more opportunity than the last 10, those who are committed to keep evolving, perform consistently, and deliver value. ","To guide our progress we have a strong, deep, and restless leadership team in place which will continue to positively evolve and change as well. I'll turn to three of those leaders Dave Wichmann, Larry Renfro, and John Rex to take us through our second quarter earnings report. Dave?","David S. Wichmann","Thank you, Steve. We enter the second half of 2017 in a strong position. UnitedHealth Group is serving more people more consistently with greater levels of measurable satisfaction than ever. We are reaching, helping, and staying connected to the people we are privileged to serve in more ways and through more channels both digitally and physically in the communities where we work. We are caring for more people, closing more gaps in care, and producing more savings and value for consumers and sponsors.","We are partnering more deeply and impactfully with care providers in part because our nearly 25,000 OptumCare doctors are dedicated to serving patients affiliated with more than 80 payers across the nation including UnitedHealthcare. That experience helps us to think more broadly than most about topics like the application of technology to enhance the consumer experience, the use of data, analytics and data exchange, effective management of healthcare resources and evidence based protocols, and healthcare quality, consistency and payment models that better serve people and plan sponsors.","Today we serve 139 million people globally including 126 million people in the United States. And we see UnitedHealth Group's U.S. and global market potential as with all practical limit at this early stage in the evolution of our company. Second quarter results followed things from our first quarter performance. In the second quarter the company produced strong and balanced revenue growth pacing to exceed the $200 billion mark this year. Medical costs were in line with expectations. Operating costs continued to be well contained. The company generated strong cash flows up 29% year-over-year as adjusted net earnings grew 26% over last year's second quarter to $2.46 per share. ","For the first half of 2017 adjusted net earnings grew 28% year-over-year to $4.83 per share. UnitedHealthCare continued to deliver exceptional results in the second quarter. Excluding the individual market, UnitedHealthCare grew to serve 2.5 million more people year-over-year including 1.7 million more in the first half of 2017. This continues our consistent, multiyear organic growth performance across all three major businesses.","This growth has been fueled by a long history of restless products and service innovation responding to and even sometimes driving market evolution. This focus towards innovation has advanced the data, information, and tools to support both individual efforts to achieve better health and system wide efforts to deliver better healthcare. A business model increasingly centered on serving the unique healthcare needs of consumers, we are performing in serving new populations such as group Medicare Advantage, people with complex conditions served by Medicaid programs in emerging markets like Brazil as well as in longstanding well established markets. Healthcare is essential to everyone, individually and to the quality and productivity of societies and we aim to serve it all in one way or another, one person at a time to the best of our abilities.","A dedicated compassionate workforce of 260,000 people serving in local communities built on UnitedHealth Group values and singularly aimed at helping people live healthier lives and helping make our health system work better for everyone. They are led by a deep and stable UnitedHealthcare leadership team that has worked together for more than a decade. And finally our commitment to quality in everything we do, in advancing net promoter scores both strengthening customer and consumer retention and care provider relationships across all of our businesses. ","In many ways we are still just getting started but you can see the momentum in our results. In the employer market our local group commercial business continues to grow organically month in and month out, virtually every month for almost three years. In the past 12 months we have grown to serve nearly 600,000 more people through full risk products in the employer group market. We are growing by consistently serving the health needs of this population at more affordable levels and with greater consistency in the quality of their experiences and the cost of their coverages.","Across Medicare Advantage and Supplement UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve 935,000 more people in the past year with balanced growth in the individual senior market and the corporate retiree market. Our Medicare Advantage business continues to benefit from strong consumer retention reflecting senior's positive experience and the clear economic value of our offerings. In 2018 our distinctive product value and consumer experience should allow us to continue to grow as we expect to increase our overall Medicare Advantage market share in a growing Medicare Advantage market again next year.","States continued to turn to the private sector to strengthen and modernize their Medicaid programs. We are implementing four new State awards this year in California, Missouri, Nebraska, and Virginia. We discussed dual special needs plans with you in our first quarter call and our revenues serving people through these plans grew 33% year-over-year in the second quarter. In total our community and state business served over 700,000 more people at June 30.","Taken as a whole the UnitedHealthcare businesses grew revenues this quarter by $3.2 billion or nearly 9% to $40.8 billion despite forgoing over $1.8 billion in revenues from the ACA individual insurance market withdrawals and the health insurance tax moratorium. Earnings from operations exceeded $2.2 billion in the quarter growing 13.9% consistent with our top line growth rate in the quarter after considering the ACA items.","Let me now turn it to Larry for his perspective on UnitedHealth Group's enterprise growth and an update on Optum. Larry? ","Larry C. Renfro","Thank you, Dave. Yesterday evening UnitedHealth Group was honored to announce the early renewal and extension of our distinctive and longstanding relationship serving seniors together with AARP. Our two organizations have a 20 year history of working together to serve seniors greatest needs and to advance health and healthcare in practical ways. Each of us believes there is no better collaborator for the work we do on behalf of those we serve. We expect the value of this relationship to grow further in the years ahead as we continue to implement shared ideas and innovations, to better serve Americans over age 50 as the growth of that population accelerates meaningfully.","The AARP relationship is a good example of our leaders working at the enterprise level to develop broader, deeper relationships, strengthen customer experience through NPS disciplines, and drive strong sustained multi-year growth. Other examples abound receiving new awards as well as contract renewals and expansions serving State Medicaid programs, corporate Medicare Advantage awards, new and renewing pharmacy care services awards, and the Department of Defense engaging us to provide NurseLine and digital clinical support services to military health system beneficiaries. Or the work we are now doing for Merck and others in the life sciences domain to help understand the impact of their medicines in a value based contracting world.","The breadth of that list should give you a sense of why this team shows a high level of optimism as we look ahead to the next decade. We serve deep end markets with significant unmet needs and we are working to better serve these customers by improving the economic value of our services consistently raising quality and innovating in ways that solve problems. These efforts are steadily driving net promoter scores higher.","Turning specifically to Optum, second quarter revenues increased by $2 billion or 10% to $22.7 billion driven by strong organic growth even as OptumRx revenue growth rate was affected by its delivery of significant channel savings to customers and consumers. Optum\u2019s earnings from operations grew 20.5% to $1.5 billion as operating margins expanded 60 basis points over last year to 6.7%. All segments grew earnings by double-digit percentage rates in the second quarter. At OptumHealth we grew to serve 9 million more people in the past 12 months with per capita revenues growing about 13%. This is an important metric as we look towards future deepening our relationships with the consumer.","Growth continues to be led by OptumCare business which grew revenues by more than 40% through the combination of strong organic growth and strategic business expansion. At OptumCare our goal is to create and operate the leading high value ambulatory care delivery system in the nation offering high quality, cost effective care to a full spectrum of payers and patients. We do this by empowering clinicians with data, insight, and workflow protocols that bring the best of Optum analytics to bare in settings where strong analytics directly impact people's lives for the better. ","By improving patient value and satisfaction at the best sites of service for care delivery, helping people access care that is convenient, high quality and affordable, and by serving physician employees and partners giving them the tools and support they need to be great medical practitioners focused on the clinical needs of their patients and on growing their practices to serve more health plans and people. ","The second quarter was our first full quarter with surgical care affiliates included in OptumCare's results. SCAs performance is slightly ahead of our expectations at this point. The SCA team continues to expand their business establishing six surgical outpatient facilities so far this year. We are working and accelerating pipeline of opportunities on aligning future development priorities with our overall OptumCare geographic market strategy. And the needs of consumers in our health plan customers. Like SCA the MedExpress portion of OptumCare continues to grow steadily. MedExpress opened 20 new neighborhood care centers in the first half of 2017 and is on pace to produce record growth while experimenting with alternative formats and approaches that could deliver even greater convenience and value to consumers.","In the local market primary care business we were privileged this past quarter to expand with two exceptional market leading group practices in Indianapolis and Denver. We continue to align with the leading local medical groups who are committed to the idea that patients benefit significantly from deeper investment in proactive primary care services. Our doctors help patients achieve a healthier state and to do so with a favorable cost profile. We are more than five years into the OptumCare build out but we are still in the early stages. We remain focused on its steady development and see this business as a significant source of growth for the next 10 years and more.","At OptumRx the revenue growth rate of 5% was well in line with expectations for 2017. Revenue yield per script was flat as we effectively passed supply chain improvements on to our customers. We continued to experience strong customer retention as large sophisticated buyers who value transparency are attracted to our data driven clinically integrated approach. These organizations are represented in a strong pipeline stemming from our healthcare transformation alliance relationship discussed in our last earnings call and our recent award to provide pharmacy care services to the State of New Jersey beginning next year. OptumRx fulfilled 322 million adjusted scripts in the second quarter, an increase of 5% over the last year. In 2018 we again expect to grow our adjusted script volume above the industry growth rate.","OptumInsight continues its strong growth pace particularly in the payer and care provider markets with recent awards or late stage RFPs in the areas of data analytics, payment integrity, business services, revenue management, and clinical best practices. OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 18.6% or $2.1 billion in the past 12 months with $800 million added in the first half of 2017 included $300 million in the second quarter.","Stepping back Optum is positioned on the front edge of the major growth trends in the market helping the health system perform better for everyone. We use advanced technology, market leading health analytics, modern care delivery, data driven population health approaches, and distinctive pharmacy care services as a portfolio of capabilities that help our clients reduce cost and solve complex operational challenges on behalf of the people they serve. This unique position gives Optum a long runway for continued growth and we are further focusing our growth efforts to take advantage of the opportunities. ","Now let me turn it over to John Rex.","John Rex","Thank you Larry. The strength of our two business platforms drove strong, consistent, well balanced results in the quarter. Five of the seven reporting businesses had revenue growth rates above 10% as consolidated revenues grew 7.7% surpassing 50 billion in a single quarter for the first time. Our consolidated earnings from operations exceeded 3.7 billion and our net earnings to shareholders grew 30% year-over-year to 2.3 billion in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EPS rose 26% to $2.46 per share.","The second quarter medical care ratio of 82.2% brought our year-to-date care ratios to 82.3% putting us on track to be at or below the midpoint of our full year 2017 outlook of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Medical costs have been well managed and continue within our established outlook and market pricing across segments and products remains disciplined and rational. The operating cost ratio was 14.6% in the second quarter and 14.5% through the first six months. ","For the full year we expect to be at or slightly above the midpoint of our 2017 full year outlook of 14.5% plus or minus 30 basis points. Due to the mixed impact of care provider expansions which carry disproportionately higher operating costs and which added about 80 basis points year-over-year to our consolidated operating cost ratio in the quarter. These mix changes signaled the continuing diversification of our revenues.","Touching on capital for a moment, our Board increased our dividend payment rate by 20% to $3 per share annually at our June Board meet. And we expect to achieve a debt to total capital ratio of approximately 40% by the end of this current quarter, three months sooner than our previous outlook. Cash flows from operations through the first half of 2017 are solidly in line with our outlook and we continue to expect approximately 12 billion for the full year, an increase of 22.5% over last year.","This morning we've increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted net earnings to a more narrow and higher range of $9.75 to $9.90 per share, prudently recognizing the strength in this quarter. We remain comfortable with the existing Street consensus view of third quarter adjusted net earnings per share. With full year 2017 adjusted EPS now expected to grow in the area of 22% of the midpoint we feel this is an appropriate stance at this point of the year. Steve. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you, John. We recognize at this point in the year thoughts begin to shift to the year ahead. Consistent with our past practices we are not going to discuss 2018 in any depth this morning, it's simply too soon, and there is too much unknown at this point. But we can offer directionally suggests the fundamentals of our businesses remain strong and we feel positively about our ability to perform and grow in 2018.","Like any year 2018 will have its share of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds are largely organic and company specific. Among them we would include continuing growth momentum and performance particularly with customer retention as our focus on NPS improves, increasingly effective capabilities to manage and contain medical costs, the improving leverage of our operating infrastructure, and our continuing efforts to optimizing capital management, investment income, tax cost, and other areas.","The headwinds are largely around externalities. National and state healthcare policies, funding trends, and taxes which we and you are all following closely. We respect the complexity of the social, economic, and political matters that are intertwined here and certainly at this stage in the national conversation speculation about any outcome here would just be that. So we approach each year determined to overcome headwinds and grow to our best potential given the diverse and complementary portfolio of businesses and capabilities we can deploy.","For 2018 and beyond themes for us will center around continued broad based and diverse organic growth across our portfolio. Steady substantive advances in quality and NPS that will gain further momentum in 2018 and position us well for the future. But first focus on costs, to drive better product price points continued evolution of our products and services toward more consumer centric and market response of designs particularly in healthcare delivery and pharmacy care services, deeper larger relationships, market alliances, and other channel partnerships. ","Advancements in the application of next generation technologies to drive better health outcomes, value and consumer experience at lower cost. And with capital capacities at full strength continued focus on thoughtful deployment of capital including expansion and diversification both domestically and globally and return of capital to shareholders through market rate dividends and measured levels of share repurchase. We will give you some initial direction on 2018 in our third quarter earnings call and the full review at our November 28th Investor Conference.","We remain positive and constructive with respect to our organizations potential to better serve the health and well being of individuals and improve the health system overall. As we respond to these needs we will realize the remarkable growth potential of this enterprise and we thank you today for your interest. Our executive team is here in the room with us to answer your questions and please only one question per person, thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the OptumCare business but first let me congratulate Andrew on the new role and then given the optimism on future growth here that was discussed, hoping you could put some numbers around the opportunity, maybe share with us the current revenue profile for 2017 that\u2019s expected here? And then where do you see the ultimate business opportunity in terms of the TAM as you continue to roll out your 75 target MSAs and then maybe share where you think is the sustainable growth rate for this segment of the business going forward? Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Justin you seem to have captured all the appropriate themes maybe we'll have Larry start and then Andrew pick that up.","Larry C. Renfro","Sure. Justin that's a good question and it\u2019s an appropriate question but I thought I might since we're going to talk about growth and maybe give you kind of a general view of growth across Optum for a second and then we\u2019ll get to Andrew but I'm going to ask some other people to talk about growth as well. I'm probably going to bring in Tim Wicks from a financial standpoint. And John Prince from a PBM standpoint and Eric from Optum360. But we\u2019ll lead off with Andrew in a second. There's really just some three areas of what I'd call metrics that we pay attention to when we are looking at our growth across Optum. Number one is are our sales pipeline and I think you hit that and again I'm talking about Optum in general. And our pipeline today is greater than $40 billion and it's a strong, strong pipeline and that's not including what I would call mega deals. This is excluding them but we have a very robust pipeline of about $40 billion. ","Our sales year-to-date is around 23 billion and that 23 billion would compare to last year's sales in 2016 in total of about 30 billion. The year before at about 10 billion so you can see the growth that's taken place from an overall sales perspective. The third area on the metrics would be how we look at our backlog and Eric Murphy will talk about that in a second but it's up and I think I mentioned it in the script 19% and year-over-year about $2.1 billion. So as we have really kicked this year off and what we've done through the first six months has been very robust in all three of those areas. So let me switch over to Andrew and let Andrew talk specifically about what the question that you asked and then we're going to walk through some of the other growth areas as well. Andrew? ","Andrew Hayek","Thanks Larry, good morning Justin. So as you know we have a belief that there's a significant opportunity to improve the quality, the experience, and the cost of healthcare on a national basis creating value for patients and the marketplace. And the experience over the past several years has been that physicians can achieve outstanding results when empowered with the right analytics, tools, and support. And the market is asking for these kinds of models to improve the cost, quality of care. So our approach is to tailor our market presence based on the local factors in each market that we serve, leveraging primary care, urgent care, surgery centers, and house calls, leveraging technology and tools from across Optum to create value for our patients and for our care providers. We are building this in a multi payer manner serving all payers in the markets that we serve and we believe your question that the market potential is very significant, the depth of the issues resolving, the value we can create for patients into the marketplace is very significant, and we look forward to creating a business multiples of our current size. ","Tim Wicks","Justin, it is Tim Wicks, let me jump in as well and talk about overall Optum revenues. So, overall total revenue and unaffiliated revenue growth were both in line with our expectations on the quarter. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together had double-digit unaffiliated revenue growth for the quarter as well. I would point also then to OptumRx and just want to clarify this work in the supply chain that we've been doing is translating into lower drug costs for consumers and customers and that really would translate then into lower external revenue for this quarter even though external scripts were up year-over-year. As you know we never apologized UHC's growth and UHC grew faster in the quarter which is obviously a positive impact to our revenue as well. So as we look at the quarter our revenue and product mix are on plan for yield. Total revenue and external revenue both in line with our expectations.","John Prince","Justin, this is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. I just wanted to talk a little about OptumRx and how we are doing. We're halfway through the year. We are hitting our new business targets and we remain very confident about hitting our full year target. Our retention is very strong, we have renewal rates in the high 90's. As Larry mentioned in the script we're very honored about the award from the State of New Jersey. That deal actually brings us more than 700,000 new members. We see a broad trend that large, sophisticated buyers are very attracted to our pharmacy care services model, it is very differentiated in the market. We've had some other normal wins and we have a health plan wins and also we have renewed our health plan clients who are out too this year. We have several new wins through the healthcare transformation alliance which we announced last quarter. I would say overall we are very optimistic about OptumRx's compelling buyer proposition in the market, it is resonating well and we are seeing very good results. ","Eric Murphy","Thanks John. Justin, Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. To Larry's point around regarding Optum360 as well as our backlog, regarding Optum360 we are in late stage assessments with four major delivery systems. Our qualified pipeline for Optum360 is up 60% year-over-year. The sales cycles in this side of the market as we've shared in the past are elongated and we're working diligently right now to improve the assessments that we do with our clients and prospects in this area to be able to get to value proposition discovery in the shorter period of time to generate results for these delivery systems. And then finally I would share we\u2019re bullish on where we land for the year regarding backlog of between $15 billion and $16 billion for 2017. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","So that was more than you asked for Justin but a very fulsome answer so the next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","David Windley","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I will switch over to OptumRx, some recent comments that you made quantified the channel savings that you're making reference to this morning at savings I think on a PMP wide basis of about $1300. I also quantified $200 of medical, what I might call mock on savings or what I believe to be your evidence of the value of synchronization and I wondered if you could maybe elaborate on that and talk about where you think that $200 can go?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. John, do you want to respond to that. ","John Prince","Sure. David, this is John Prince. I am not sure I followed all the math that you're doing but let me take it at a high level. I think you know I see at the high level happening and if you just look at our external client market is that our number of clients we serve is up, our number of scripts is up but actually the revenue is sort of flat on a per script basis and I think that is really what you see is that the value that we're doing really looking at net best cost for clients as we are delivering that. And I think that is also why our story is resonating in the market in terms of the value that we bring to our clients. What we're also seeing is that even though we're delivering that value our external product gross margin actually is up year-over-year. ","So actually we're getting the margin online business was driven by that more volume. So we're actually getting greater margin on it but we're actually delivering that value back to the client. When we're going out into the market we're actually talking about not just the pharmacy cost but we're talking about total cost of care. So what you are seeing in the revenue here that\u2019s our story of the market around pharmacy cost but our real value story as you go to market is people looking at total cost of care. And so we actually have a story in the market which we're talking to that actually talks about how we save a client $11 to $16 per month as they talk about our full synchronized solution. And that is what our clients are receiving. In our UHC book about 30% of the clients have that synchronized value. We also do that on a direct basis and also with other partners in terms of other health plans that we served in the market. So, clearly we are seeing a very differentiated value that our clients are seeing in their trend.","David Windley","So if I could just clarify so the point to the question was where can the $11 to $16 per member per month go?","John Prince","Well the $11 to $16 goes back in terms of their total cost of healthcare, so it actually went forward to our number, actually the client would see that and the return it would give to them. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","It was to the benefit of the client, our benefit is the retention of customers and the growth that we get.","David Windley","Thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Kevin Fischbeck","Hey great, thanks. I wanted to ask a question on MA actually, maybe a two part question. First, given all the growth that you have there just want to make sure that the performance from margin across expectation is coming in line with how you had expected it this year? And I guess secondly you mentioned that you expect to gain share again next year, wanted to get a little more color on the purpose behind that because group MA went so far, is there anything you don't have that your competitors bids up for next year so I just want to know what gave you confidence in saying that you are going to gain share this early in the process? ","Stephen J. Hemsley","Why don\u2019t we ask Steve Nelson kind of give you the broader themes and then Brian Thompson will fill in the rest. ","Steve Nelson","Thanks, Steve. Hey Kevin, this is Steve Nelson. Let me just talk a little bit about how we're thinking about growth and the positioning of UnitedHealthcare overall and because I think the themes are pretty consistent as we move to a specific Medicare Advantage conversation. But we've been very focused on a specific agenda trying to drive value, improve our quality, very focused on costs both medical and administrative that are really driving an agenda of what we call distinction, trying to innovate around our both our clinical experience and our service experience, driving improved NPS. We see that actually across our businesses but particularly in our MAPD business as well, driving more attention which I think is significantly contributing to the growth and also the inline performance we've seen this year on that growth. But also you just heard the Optum team talk about their robust capabilities as we bring those things into UnitedHealthcare. We continue to see that really resonating in the market across all of our businesses. And so we're really bringing this agenda of distinction to new populations whether we are talking about bringing populations into more populations with complex care, complex conditions into managed Medicaid or some of the emerging populations that we continue to see grow whether it's a D-SNP or group Medicare Advantages as you referenced. So really well positioned across all of these businesses but MA is a tremendous story so with that maybe just have Brian give some color about what we are seeing there early in this year. ","Brian Thompson","Steve, thank you. Kevin, good morning, this is Brian Thompson. For 2017 we are off to a very strong first half of the year on both service and support as well as our engagement with our new seniors that have chosen UnitedHealthcare. What we are seeing is aligning to our expectations, so we are not only pleased with what we're seeing in 2017 year-to-date but also our positioning as we look forward to 2018 and we have a very positive long-term outlook for the industry and for us specifically. We expect as you heard to continue to outperform the market in 2018 overall on MA balanced both in group and individual just as we did this year and the two years prior. ","The return of the insurance fee will be the single largest headwind in 2018, it's return was assumed that our 2018 bid submissions but despite the return of the tax and program funding pressure there, we do intend to keep our benefit offerings as stable as possible and we intend to compliment our 2018 growth and product stability with advances in both quality and satisfaction. So our products will again be designed for high levels of retention. So on balance we are very optimistic, we are optimistic about our positioning both group and individual against the backdrop of an advancing very positive industry growth outlook for 2018.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you next question. ","Operator","The next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. ","Chris Rigg","Good morning. I just wanted to ask or get a little more color on the operating cost ratio and just to better understand the mix dynamics there and I guess most importantly I'm trying to determine whether is there an incremental investment spending in the number related to the provider side or is that all just mix at this point? Thanks. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","John?","John Rex","Yes, thanks. John Rex here, so when I talked about the 80 basis points of impact, that was truly just the mix impact, a higher proportion of really care delivery businesses in our revenue base and that's the impact that we're seeing in the business. So that is straight up the care delivery business expanding and growing and care delivery business somewhere now in kind of two thirds of the range of all of OptumHealth. There are always investments we're making across the businesses and certainly within our OCR this quarter there were plenty but our commitment to you is to always balance those and as we deliver our results by that point of segment the 80 basis points does not include investments that we make.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Excellent, next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Costa","Hi, thanks. You mentioned the impact of the health insurance will be coming back next year, if it does come back next year that turns into quite a price increase for the commercial planned staff to pay, more than most businesses are growing these days. So can you talk about what you're seeing employers do right now that counteract that rising cost in terms of what cost cutting measures are they putting in place and what cost cutting measures are you putting in place to help ameliorate the rate increase?","Stephen J. Hemsley","So, maybe Jeff Alter and Dan Schumacher can you kind of combine on that. ","Jeff Alter","Sure, thanks Peter. Its Jeff Alter. You know a few years ago we put forth a very purposeful initiative to expand our portfolio of fully insured products which included broadening that portfolio to reach many different price points and then connecting those products with varying network structures. So we have a very robust product portfolio that allows our clients to adjust to increasing medical costs whether that\u2019s driven by pharmacy or driven by medical costs or driven by legislative and regulatory actions. So our clients have the ability to create five down opportunities or to change in complimenting their benefit strategies without having to change their carrier because of the proactive work we've done in our product portfolio particularly in our fully insured product portfolio.","Dan Schumacher","So I think variety of products and offerings and really focus on broad range of price points. ","Peter Costa","Is there anything in particular that's being picked up more than not.","Jeff Alter","You know I would say that there's far more interest in varying network constructs. One of the more popular choice has been the leveraging of our more than a decade old premium designation program where we use lot of the OptumInsight in analytics to determine the best providers, those that practice both first and foremost always quality but then efficiency. And so we've created network and product structures that drive people to those top tier doctors using either co-pay or co-insurance variations. It has become very popular because it helps our clients achieve the price points that are affordable for them but also given the comfort that people are getting better outcomes at a lower cost. And I think that's a real story of the integration of the UnitedHealthcare and in Optum to deliver meaningful value to a marketplace that first and foremost drives people to the best performing physicians. But overall achieves a price point for their sponsors. ","Peter Costa","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel ","Thanks, just had a question just on the tax rate. I know there's been a few discrete items this year so first, just if you have just an updated guidance for the tax rate this year and then what you would view as sort of a good sort of run rate, tax rate, looking out that we should be modeling for next year excluding obviously the return of the industry?","Stephen J. Hemsley","We're so we're going to not actually get into 2018 too much but John, do you want to respond?","John Rex","Thanks Scott, John Rex here. I will speak to this year. So we're not updating our tax rate outlook for the year here. Let me just talk a little bit about within the quarter because we did speak about it last quarter also. So there is nothing unusual that I would spike out in the 2Q effective tax rate beyond normal exercise activity. So typically with the share purchase -- with stock based compensation accounting we're going to see more impact in the first half and the second half in terms of lowering that tax rate. So we\u2019d expect that to increase in the second half. In the first quarter we had really talked about half of the impact that we expected to be nonrecurring and that was really due to just an unusually large amount of stock option exercises. It was related in part to an older acquisition and so that was the piece we spiked out there. But I wouldn't spike out anything as unusual in this quarter's rate and we'd be at the still in that 32.5% zone. We\u2019d always try to do a little bit better than we can and that would be my aspiration but that\u2019s what it would be.","Scott Fidel ","Okay, thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Next question please.","Operator","Next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hello everybody, I just maybe ask about capital deployment John, I think in your prepared remarks you're saying that you guys will hit your yearend target by the end of the third quarter for where you were hoping debt to cap would be. There's been a lot of discussion in the press about your potentially being involved in various M&A type of transactions supporting Optum, Reliant, Advisory Board, etc. I guess conceptually as you guys get to your debt to cap target do you -- is the M&A environment just so robust what you're seeing out there that your capital is going to continue to be mainly focus there, do you see an opportunity to maybe reestablish more actively the buyback program, give us some flavor for where you guys are thinking on capital deployment?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think maybe Dave Wichmann would respond. ","David S. Wichmann","Sure A.J. Thank you for the question. Very thoughtful. So you're right that our ambitions are to achieve our 40% leverage ratio by the end of the third quarter and we think we stand a really good shot at getting there which should be one quarter early. John has done a very nice job in managing our capital structure and getting us into that position along with our team. As you know we don't discuss rumors and speculation about our M&A activity and we're certainly not going to start today. But I think as you know A.J. that M&A has been a critical part of the way in which this organization has identified new opportunities to serve more people and more market broadly. And those ambitions continue as Steve lined out in his concluding remarks in the opening remarks around those ambitions being both domestic as well as global. And really focused in the services category really continuing to support Optum's growth and diversification, establishing platforms like you saw with OptumCare which we believe will be strong growth performers for us for the next decade. And I could go on and list many more but I think you get the idea. So it is a core part of our emphasis. ","As relates to share repurchase we continue with a consistent policy at this time whereby we are just trying to keep our share count level. And as I believe you saw in June we increased our dividend again to a rate of $3 per share which is a 20% increase in continuing with our ambitions of advancing our dividend to a market rate level. Thank you. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","Next question please. ","Operator","We will go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Joshua Raskin","Hi, thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about potential changes in tax rate and I understand it's very premature, we don't even have necessarily a real proposal from the Republicans but to the extent that you guys have thought about it, I'm curious what the impact on your tax rate is from the non-deductibility of the excess compensation, how you would think about the introduction add back? And then as I look about your tax rate sort of before the ACA, your tax rate today is running 400 to 500 basis points below where you were so, just trying to sort of level set the opportunity were there to be changes and maybe specifically on those two items that we know have the potential to change?","Stephen J. Hemsley","You know Josh we are really not going to try to get into themes that could affect 2018 outlook but we would really prefer to do that not in a peaceful way but in a more fulsome way when we can really talk about all the elements. The insurance tax is clearly if it has sustained a headwind influencing 2018 and its progress of data really effects the cost for consumers in both -- across the commercial Medicare and Medicaid markets, etc. And it's a factor in terms of market -- it is stabilizing factor in the marketplace both in its cost. So the return of the tax making would further destabilize the market which is already fragile. And make that market less affordable. ","So we are we would clearly think that either repealing or deferring that would be a positive thing but as it relates to our actual workings with our 2018 outlook or tax rate and so forth we're just going to save those so that we can actually go through them with you in a more thoughtful way, in a more complete way, maybe to some extent in the third quarter but for sure at our Investor Conference. ","Joshua Raskin","Do I get a mulligan then Steve. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","You do. Alright do you want a another.","Joshua Raskin","I will pretend that didn\u2019t happen. So my next question would just be, we're talking about OptumHealth and OptumCare specifically. We're seeing a lot of discussion among competitors around growth in urgent care in ASC's, how would you describe the competitive landscape, are you seeing more and more supply of like services in the market and is that impacting OptumCare at all. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","You know, I think we are but I think others are better qualified to respond to that. So, maybe Larry to begin and then Andrew.","Larry C. Renfro","Okay, Josh the -- as you know when we put our program together, when we started OptumCare it was probably about 2012 when we brought the Optum business plan and so I would say we got out early in terms of how we were going to approach the market and how we were going to look at it from an investing standpoint or we would partner, we would contract, buy, build. So we had a lot of different strategies in terms of how we were going to really attack and put together our OptumCare program. So urgent care, care delivery, the surgery care, house calls, behavioral we have all of those programs in place and they are actually functioning extremely well. And I'm going to let Andrew talk about it but, the one thing I would say is we are early but we have an established platform. We didn't miss any boat here. We are out and we understand the marketplace and we are in the process of a evaluating many different organizations on how we say that they fit with us and we have a very robust opportunity that we are seeing in the marketplace. So with that I will turn it over to Andrew.","Andrew Hayek","Thanks Larry and good morning Josh. So I would say the local markets remain competitive in different ways, in unique ways depending on the market structure. But as we look across our OptumCare platforms in physician groups, the SCA, MedExpress, house calls the distinctive capabilities that we have really created demand for what we have to offer in improving the quality, the cost, the experience, the care and improving the provider experience. And so I'd say is the market force has continued to push towards higher quality at more cost effective price points. The demand for a distinctive platform that can enable physicians and care providers to achieve better results, leveraging tools, and insight and other components of our platform the need for what we have to offer is growing. And we remain very bullish and optimistic around the opportunity to expand across the 75 markets to deepen our presence in the markets we currently serve. As Larry referenced we believe we\u2019re in the very early stages of this opportunity and again in many respects the increasing competition increases the demand for a distinctive platform which we have. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","So maybe we could then give it to Dan because that really kind of the voice of demand in there. ","Dan Schumacher","Sure, so Josh one thing I would just highlight is obviously when you look at our spend and the composition of it and how much of it orients to the acute setting. We've got so many surgical procedures and so forth that are happening in inpatient and outpatient hospital settings and the reality is we've seen for a long time an opportunity to really focus on the side of service, get them into places where we can drive better quality, frankly a better patient experience at a lower cost as Andrew has been talking about. And we do it in a couple of ways. Certainly we do it in terms of our approach to medical management, so looking at prior authorization and making sure that we're getting it into the right side of service on the front end before procedures are happening. We are also building it into the product designs as well so that we're putting incentives in there to make some of the transition from acute to ambulatory to really drive the kind of outcomes that we're looking for. ","And more recently with the acquisition of SCA and our partnership there we are really leaning into that and investing in quality incentives for surgeons so that we can drive greater volumes into these less intensive settings and we're able to do frankly more acute procedures and more complicated procedures in that setting as well. So we see a lot of opportunity in it. We've got it in place in select markets today and we will be looking to expand that meaningfully over the course of this year and into next. So those are some of the things that we're doing around both the plan design, the medical management, as well as the incentives to put those three things together in alignment to drive those transitions from acute settings to ambulatory settings to drive better cost, value, and experience. Larry.","Larry C. Renfro","I\u2019d just like to add one other aspect of the Optum business and that would be Optum360. Sometimes we forget that on the primary care side, the urgent care, and now what we're doing with surgery care across the board we have strategic relationships with a lot of the Optum360 clients that are actually involved with us in using those programs. And so we get caught up in terms of talking about how we're looking at our different programs in OptumCare mainly from a health plan standpoint when the Optum360 organizations are actively engaged with how we tie into them as well. So that's a whole other avenue of our business there.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. You know, there has been headlines around States potentially tying Medicaid contracts to exchange participation. So just want to get your thoughts on that and then with procurements coming up, how concerned are you that States consider exchange participation even if not explicitly and how could that influence your views around reentering the exchange? Thanks. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","Maybe, we'll have Austin begin to comment with respect to safe base to dead end.","Austin Pittman","So I guess first and foremost these are really State by State discussions and not something that we're really going to comment broadly here and not going to speculate about that. I would say with regard to your second question we are constantly in conversations with our States on how to expand coverage for more people, particularly those with complex needs. A lot of the activity that we see both in renewal activity as well as new business certainly surrounds that which as we talked about before is a real area of distinction for the combination of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. So we're very positive, we look forward to continue to serve our States and find solutions, particularly get around these populations with very complex needs.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So we'll continue to work with State and so forth but I don't see anything that establishes what might be a trend with respect to tying these kinds of programs together. States have been I think very thoughtful about this to date so I think that's the best response we can offer at the moment. Next question. ","Operator","Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffrey. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. Stephen what we know now about Medicare market [indiscernible] could the market see a continuation of the 2% and then penetration increase that we saw in 2017 and long-term given the inherent value proposition at Medicare Advantage where do you think penetration is heading, with the potential market that is 50% MA? ","Stephen J. Hemsley","Maybe I will have Steve respond to that but I think we've been pretty consistent in the past that we do expect that penetration to go forward and we do expect the MA market to mature and grow. ","Steve Nelson","Good morning Sarah, Steve Nelson. I agree with Steve's high level comments there. I have seen clearly in our experience we have seen tremendous growth in our Medicare Advantage and while that clearly we think is driven by some of the things that we uniquely bring to the market whether it's the stability or benefits, the product designs, the service, and the clinical models. But also in addition to that there's just a real strong overall value proposition with Medicare Advantage and we're seeing that not only just with the folks that we serve but as we talk to policy makers too there's really strong support for it. So you see a population that needs it, it serves them well. It drives down cost, the satisfaction is up, it's definitely growing, and so we think that's going to continue. And so we do think there's an opportunity to further advance the penetration of the Medicare Advantage, where it can go hard to tell but I don't think it's unreasonable to think about something north of -- considerably north of where we are, about 40% approaching 50%. It doesn't seem like a unreasonable idea to us, no. I would think that we would think that it could go 50% or better.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Next question please.","Operator","We go next to Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, thank you and I'm going to ask a question that sort of asked before but just as you know had started with your comment but you've added 600,000 group commercial risk lives year-over-year I just wanted to understand I mean, you're obviously doing better than almost all your competitors, most of whom are seeing attrition on the group commercial risks. And I guess the question you described your pricing, I think John did as disciplined and rational which I'm not disputing, my question is, is this really just that you are producing a better medical cost outcome and so you can price lower than the market because a lot of this business you can correct me if I am wrong, it moves unpriced, sorry for the long question?","Stephen J. Hemsley","So I think that we started to get into this a little bit before when Jeff Alter was commenting, it is I think a function of many things of which cost structure is clearly part of it but its spectrum of products, the design, etc. So Jeff do you want to respond?","Jeff Alter","Sure, hey Matt. I guess I would try in my response to kind of a discussion of what's here. So I would say the market moves on value, it doesn't necessarily move on price. And we have been very purposeful across our product, our services, the focus on NPS has I think brought a much stronger value proposition to particularly the fully insured small growth market. Long-term disciplined pricing is a good thing and I think you're seeing the discipline that we had in the early stages of the ACA now coming back to us as a value play. Couple that with a very purposeful decision a number of years ago to broaden our product portfolio and to offer a much broader spectrum of network opportunities or choice for particularly our fully insured small group clients. ","We also have undertaken a different view with our distribution community, our brokers and consultants, a more disciplined approach with them narrowing some of that distribution network to more favorite partners and giving them some added services. So one of the things that we've learned over the years that our brokers and our consultants in that marketplace seek to do business with those that make it easier for them to do business with. We've created again with the assistance of rally and our Optum partners a much easier way for our small business brokers to onboard clients with us, to make plan changes, to recommend using some of the OptumInsight analytics. The next logical moves for buy down so, you really have to look at the value we bring as opposed to the price of our product. I think it maps the answer to why our particularly our small group fully insured business has done well over the last few years. ","Matthew Borsch","Thank you. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you, next question please?","Operator","We go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. ","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks, good morning. On Optum you saw some really nice margin expansion on OptumHealth and OptumRx despite the mix shifting pressures you talked about on providers. I was just wondering if this is an area of focus for the organization or this is one off and where could the margins shake out by business line and overall?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Larry, maybe you want to respond to that, clearly an area of focus right.","Larry C. Renfro","It is an area of focus and Ana we\u2019re obviously you're looking at both from a financial perspective as well from a margin perspective and all that is in line with our expectations. I am going to ask Tim to Tim Wicks to comment on this.","Tim Wicks","Sure, thanks Ana. First, as we think about the margin growth that we're seeing since we had -- we\u2019re pleased to start a very strong start to the year 2017. The earnings are in line with our expectations June year-to-date and comprise about 40% of the full year expectations and so right in line with both our prior several years of experience in the first half of the year as well as our 2017 guidance.","I think it's also important to understand that there's seasonality in our businesses and maybe I'll just point two examples where there's some seasonality. One, is in OptumInsight, as you know the second half of the year is typically pretty strong and in terms of the relative distribution of earnings growth in the year and it's really driven by several other businesses in OptumInsight quality and the risk businesses, the Optum360 content sales as well as technology data and software sales. ","The second example I would use is in OptumHealth as well is when we look at OptumHealth SCA volume is characteristically also stronger in the second half of the year. And then typically we expect fourth quarter overall for Optum to be stronger than the third quarter as well as we go through the year.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you. We\u2019ll do two more questions and then we'll have to close it. So, we will do two more questions first. ","Operator","We'll go to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Sheryl Skolnick","Thank you very much for keeping me in. So I'll just observe that if this is early stage growth for $200 billion revenue run rate company to produce what you're producing I'd like to see what late stage looks like. So thank you for that but, the real question I have here is that I've learned overtime to pay close attention to what is said on this call and one of the things that you mentioned Steve early on in your remarks was that words to the effect of it is now time to turn our attention to cost. In the past when you've turned the organization's attention to something its resulted in significant advances for the business enterprise as a whole and I'm wondering if this is one of those things that we should be paying attention to, and if so if you can quantify it in any way or qualify it in any way to give us a sense of where the opportunities are, I know we've discussed it from the OptumCare perspective but, more broadly across the enterprise would be helpful? Thank you. ","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'm not sure I can offer you too much specifics but that was intentional. I think that in general if you take a look at our organization we have grown well over the last couple of years. We've been able to add some and introduce some strong companies into our portfolio. And I think that if you see the growth and in essence the net productivity out of that you\u2019d sit back and say there's an opportunity to strengthen the enterprise, continue to lead the enterprise focused on the things that are most important. And if you recognize the value equation as its played out in the marketplace many of today's themes were around retention of customers, value to customers, and so forth. As one of the questioners pointed out, the price point is a very important part of this. We have to challenge ourselves to deliver value all the time. We're in a very strong position, this is a great time to be taking that challenge up and that is what we're focused on. ","We think we can deliver more value, we think we can drive more innovation, fresh approaches, and I think this enterprises folks who are ready to do that. The alignment of new technologies to that effort, use of more advanced data analytics produce a lot of opportunity for us particularly just given the set up of our businesses. So those are the themes around that and we are focused on our marketplace that's going to be looking for value and think that we can anticipate that. I think NPS is a big part of that effort as well. Thank you for the question. Next, last question please ","Operator","And we'll go to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Zack Sopcak","Hey good morning, thank you. I wanted to ask about CMS\u2019s proposal to remove knee arthroplasty from the in-patient only list. Was that something that you considered happening in the near term when you are in the stages of acquiring SCA and how do you think about the impact of that business over a longer term, is it meaningful and does that have any impact on your MA strategy going forward?","Andrew Hayek","It\u2019s Andrew. I'd offer a couple comments here. From an SCA perspective the team there has been focusing on higher acuity procedures for several years in orthopedics, in spine, in cardiovascular and that includes total joint replacements which the SCA team has been performing on a commercial basis for a number of years with outstanding results. Very consistent with the AAA in terms of the quality outcomes, the patient experience, and of course material cost savings. So we've been applying that in the commercial environment and there's been discussion for a number of years at the CMS level around the potential to allow total joint replacement in the surgery center setting which we of course would embrace allowing us to extend the benefits of that platform in terms of quality experience and obviously reducing total cost and extend that to the Medicare population. So in many ways we have been anticipating this. This is something on a commercial basis we've been doing. We can obviously speculate as to how -- what the outcome will be but this is a positive and consistent with the strategy we've been pursuing.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So thank you. Thank you once again for your interest in our progress today. Kind of midway through the year our performance and momentum remain strong. We expect to continue to deliver higher quality and value in healthcare and sustainable growth throughout 2017, 2018 and the years to come. Our thanks to our people who through their commitment to our mission and culture are helping to drive our enterprise to reach its full potential. Thank you and that concludes our call today. ","Operator","This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 16, 2014, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we will review our 2014 third quarter and 9-month financial results, results which have been consistently in line with or ahead of the outlook we shared with you nearly 1 year ago. We're seeing steady progress across our businesses, and over the next 2 years, expect our overall business performance to further strengthen and accelerate in both top and bottom line growth. Our top line performance this quarter suggests an improving environment for our offerings, combined with steady consistent execution. Revenue grew 7% year-over-year, led by growth in senior and public sector benefits and across Optum's portfolio of Health Services. Consistent execution is evident in our performance in managing medical and operating costs, successful state Medicaid expansion, moderately improving Medicare star rating, and the value clients are realizing in Optum's provider, payer and government markets, and all of this is in the face of unprecedented healthcare reform across the United States.","Our third quarter revenues were $32.8 billion, and earnings per share grew 7% to $1.63 per share. UnitedHealthcare results clearly strengthened with Optum again contributing 30% of our enterprise-wide operating earnings. Operating cash flows of $3.2 billion were exceptional at twice our net income level despite remitting $1.3 billion in federal ACA taxes during this quarter. This morning, we are affirming our 2014 revenue outlook of $130 billion and raising our net earnings projection to a range of $5.60 to $5.65 per share. As always, our goal is to perform in the upper end of our range. We remain focused on executing a deliberate quality and cost agenda because improving healthcare quality and affordability is core to delivering value at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. On any given day, we average 27,000 members in the hospital and another 14,000 at skilled nursing facilities. We have nearly 2,000 clinicians across the nation working with attending physicians to help keep our members on course for optimal medical outcomes, successful discharges and to avoid unnecessary readmissions. Optum expects to perform 1 million Medicare house calls and home visits this year to engage our members, understand their health status and needs, close gaps in care, and advance clinical care paths and services.","Over the past 5 years, our commitment to affordable quality care has become ever more integrated, targeted and refined. Modern plan designs harness greater patient responsibility with online tools and consumer engagement services that help people make better choices and decisions to get the right care at the right facility for the right cost. We serve nearly 6 million people in consumer-directed health plans, up from 2.9 million people just 5 years ago, and these consumers have set aside $2.7 billion in healthcare funding through health banking and investment accounts with Optum. These consumers and those in similar consumer-centric programs are motivated to engage and make the best choices about their health and healthcare. Consumer engagement includes making quality and pricing transparency tools available right at people's fingertips, right on their smartphones. These tools tap into our Premium designation quality networks, a commercial benefits program we began in 2004 that now helps link people to nearly 120,000 network doctors, recognized for consistent superior quality and efficiency. These doctors practice in clinical areas that generate more than 80% of our consumers' medical cost experience, and the results are consistently outstanding.","Our premium cardiac physicians have 28% fewer repeat procedures and a 29% lower complication rate for implantable cardiac device surgeries. Our premium orthopedic surgeon have 41% fewer repeat procedures and a 17% lower complication rate for knee surgeries. There are more examples like these, demonstrating that getting an engaged consumer to the right doctor makes a meaningful difference. Our commitment to affordability extends to the care delivery side. Value-based contracting has become foundational to UnitedHealthcare today, contracts that align care provider incentives around healthcare quality outcomes, appropriate use of services and total cost of care. Our contracts with value-based medical spend now total nearly $35 billion per year, up from less than $13 billion just 3 years ago and on the path to $65 billion by 2018, if not sooner.","The modern health system is being shaped around aligned incentives, supported by transparent information and consistently high-quality clinical services. These changes are helping our nation in turn to achieve optimal evidence-based utilization and cost. We are among the leaders shaping this next-generation healthcare system with Optum working hand-in-glove with care providers in local markets, helping them improve consistency, quality and cost structures so they can preserve and grow their patient basis as their market shifts to performance-based revenues. Our progress is apparent in UnitedHealthcare's year-by-year decrease in hospitalizations per member in every major product category, including in 2014. Over the past 6 years, UnitedHealthcare has realized accumulative 26% reduction in inpatient use per Medicare member and a 16% reduction in inpatient use per commercial member while continuing to improve overall quality of care.","To begin a brief but more detailed discussion of third quarter results, we'll start today with UnitedHealthcare. Third quarter revenues grew 6% year-over-year exceeding $30 billion. UnitedHealthcare earned more than $2 billion in the quarter driven by overall revenue growth and an efficient operating margin of 6.8%, even considering the growing mix toward lower margin public and senior sector customers. Third quarter was again led by Community & State, where we grew to serve 250,000 more people. We are now on course to grow by just under 1 million new Medicaid members this year. This record level of organic growth is well balanced with about 60% from health reform market expansions and 40% from established states under new programs that complement established approaches as well as natural growth within the traditional programs. And Medicare continues to be a growth contributor as we approach organic growth of 500,000 people across all products in 2014, a strong and consistent outcome in a year where we took necessary steps that caused some membership losses to position our Medicare Advantage products for future growth and to benefit seniors in the years ahead.","Today, we have a more focused and aligned network, supporting Medicare Advantage, a Part D program qualified to serve low-income seniors in 97% of the markets nationally for 2015 and a rising star quality that will continue to advance. For the 2015 payment year, we expect more than 37% of our MA members to be in plans rated 4 stars or higher. We expect a similar percentage in 2016 and sharply improved performance in 2017 and '18 based on efforts launched earlier this year and establishing themselves across our markets. The open-enrollment season began yesterday. We believe our products are well positioned locally. Our sales and marketing resources are properly staged and supported, and we expect solid growth in our Medicare Advantage, our Part D and Medicare supplemental offerings in 2015.","In the commercial markets, we remain focused on pricing discipline relative to cost trends, balancing margin and market positioning, all with an eye towards consistency and sustainability for both customers and consumers. The multi-quarter decline in risk-based enrollment has slowed, and the modest decrease in self-funded products were due to employment attrition. In the individual market, we remain on course to participate in nearly 2 dozen state exchanges in 2015 consistent with our original public exchange strategy. In Brazil, pricing increases reflect new baseline costs in delivering expanded mandated healthcare benefit leading to a conscious reduction in membership this year. Despite this decline, Amil's revenues were strong in the third quarter with international revenues increasing 19% year-over-year.","Turning back to medical costs, our third quarter commercial care ratio was 79.1%. The consolidated care ratio was 79.7%, a decrease of 90 basis points over last year's third quarter. Earnings were strengthened by continued favorable reserve development across the business as our affordability initiatives continue to perform well.","Moving to our Healthcare Services platform. Optum's third quarter included a healthy balance of growth, earnings performance and focused strategic market activity. Through the first 9 months, Optum revenues have grown 26% and earnings from operations by 24%. We believe the fourth quarter will be strong for this platform, and Optum remains on pace to contribute roughly 1\/3 of UnitedHealth Group's 2014 cash flows from operations, all while investing significantly in future growth. In the third quarter, Optum's revenues grew 21% year-over-year to $12 billion. Earnings from operations grew 27% year-over-year to $865 million. Operating margins rose 1 full percentage point from second quarter and 30 basis points year-over-year to 7.2%. OptumRx led this quarter's results. Revenues grew 27%. Earnings from operations grew 65% to $326 million, and operating margins were above 4%, improving 0.5 points since the June quarter and 1 percentage point year-over-year. The market is responding to the value of synchronized pharmacy and medical benefits where OptumRx uses data, technology and an integrated service model to address the total medical experience in related costs rather than solely the pharmacy silo. We have seen a number of new opportunities with employers for 2015, and we believe we have been awarded more than our fair share of that new business. This growth is additive to the growth that flows naturally from the businesses of UnitedHealthcare each year.","OptumInsight's growth was led by Optum360 revenue management and government exchange services. We continue to deliver services in the development and operation of federal and state healthcare exchanges and look forward to continuing to leverage Optum's expertise to serve our government partners in this important work. With the passing of this quarter, we have fully cycled through last October's regulatory pullback in hospital clinical compliance services. To put the magnitude of this pullback in perspective, OptumInsight's underlying operating earnings growth would have been more than 15 percentage points higher than the 6 percentage point growth we reported this quarter, which only highlights the strength and momentum of the diversified product offerings we offer in this segment, including the commercial version of our hospital clinical compliance capabilities that is gaining traction with hospitals in the market and is becoming a future growth driver.","And our position as a valued service provider to hospitals further advanced with the recent acquisition of the MedSynergies organization. MedSynergies has deep expertise in revenue management for hospital-employed physicians and medical groups. Connecting MedSynergies with our Optum360 inpatient focus creates an end-to-end revenue management offering for large sophisticated integrated care delivery systems. Coupling these with Optum's clinical software, analytics and workflow tools gives us a comprehensive and market-leading solution to serve delivery systems covering both administrative and clinical domains across the full continuum of care settings.","Within our Optum's analytics businesses, we expect to end the year with more than 50 million lives of longitudinal clinical data, up 50% in a year, and easily one of the largest such resources in the country, if not the largest, and it supplements our 155 million person administrative claims data repository. Increasingly, we are harnessing this sophisticated data resource for advanced analytics across multiple platforms to meet growing market needs around managing the health of populations.","OptumHealth reported an 11% operating margin in the third quarter with earnings from operations up 16% year-over-year. These results were led by our Collaborative Care businesses. Today, Optum touches 2 million consumers through our Collaborative Care physicians and clinical professionals who are prominent leaders in their local markets, recognized for clinical quality. As our medical groups transition to Optum technology, we further improve their execution on behalf of the patients and payers they serve, help grow their business and generate superior financial returns. More broadly within OptumHealth, we look to meaningfully improve clinical outcomes and patient well-being across multiple settings: outpatient, within institutions and in the home. We expect Optum overall revenues to be at the upper end or perhaps above our target of $45 billion to $46 billion with earnings from operations near the upper end of our previous outlook of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. Optum's future growth should continue to be strong, supported by our $7.7 billion contract revenue backlog and exceptional levels of customer pipeline activity.","To summarize, 2014 performance remains consistently strong through the first 9 months, particularly considering the ACA headwinds this year. Revenues have grown year-over-year by 6%. We have increased our full year net earnings outlook to a range of $5.60 to $5.65 per share, and this earnings outlook accommodates expected fourth quarter seasonality, strong Optum performance to close the year and fourth quarter investments in growth, including strong Medicare Advantage marketing and the launch of our individual products on health exchanges in 19 new states. We expect 2014 cash flows from operations will be around $8 billion, possibly more. Our growing earnings capacity this year positions us well for 2015. At this distance, I would offer that the consensus earnings estimates for next year do a pretty good job of calibrating our 2015 outlook reflecting the combination of opportunities we expect to pursue and the challenges we expect to manage. We remain fully committed to consistent fundamental execution with the objective of realizing as much of our true potential as possible in every endeavor. We will provide details of our 2015 outlook at our Investor Conference on December 2 in the context of our long-term strategy and our opportunity to serve people and to build value.","So now I'll turn this call back to our moderator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] So thank you very much. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is on the commercial business. First, can you talk about your early view on exchange positioning in terms of products and price relative to peers, and how we should think about profit targets here given the losses in '14 that we see across the industry? And then just a quick comment on New York's small group and how we should think about over 2015 given the pushback on pricing seen from regulators.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Okay, Justin, we'll respond to your 2-part question. I will offer some perspective that we are trying to participate thoughtfully in exchanges and have not -- don't have -- have not built excessive expectations on that. I think Jeff will talk to exchanges and then maybe to New York.","Jeff Alter","Sure. Good morning, Justin. It's Jeff Alter. So on your first question or your first part of your single question on public exchanges, I would say it's keeping with our strategy that we waited to see what was going on in '14 and then are using that knowledge. It built a different platform for exchanges. So when you think about where our products are positioned, many of those products come with a network construct that's probably nontraditional to what you might expect from UnitedHealthcare. We feel good about where we're positioned. We are targeting profitability in '15, probably a little bit lower than that 3% to 5% long-term range that we've talked about but still profitable. And from what we know today, we feel pretty good about where we're positioned in many of the exchanges, particularly the largest states where we expect to grow the most. New York, I would say, nothing's changed too much in New York from the competitive environment that we -- we're in the middle of this year. The rate actions -- the rate approval actions by the regulator pretty much give us, for the most part, the same competitive marketplace in New York for 2015 that we have today. We're fortunate to have a broad portfolio of fully insured business across the country, and we're managing through some of those regulator responses right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe I could ask about Medicare Advantage. If you could just -- I realize you'll go into detail at the December 2 Investor Day, but maybe you can just talk to the scope of the benefit changes that you made and if you can characterize how they look to you at your initial look versus what the competition has put out and maybe directionally, if you think that you'll be able to grow membership and earnings next year.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think we feel pretty good about it. Steve, you want to comment?","Steve Nelson","Sure. Hi, Matt, Steve Nelson. Yes, we really like our position going into 2015. Benefits shaped up about as we expected. We have -- we think we're positioned very well to grow in 2015 meaningfully at sustainable margins. Other software, we did add premiums, which was a important step to the long-term viability of this product, and -- but we are very thoughtful about that. We added premiums in markets where premiums already existed, and we added about -- to about 1\/3 of our members. In 1\/3 of those cases, we added 0 premium alternatives. In places where we didn't do that, we enhanced our benefits in meaningful ways that we knew based on our research would be important to seniors. So we feel very positive 1 day into open enrollment, and we expect to grow meaningfully at sustainable margins.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the earnings growth? Sorry.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, we expect to grow earnings across the board for 2015. Actually, we think all of our businesses are really better positioned than they were as we entered into '14. And really, the underpinnings of our '15 outlook, obviously, they -- different contributions, but we're expecting growth completely across all our businesses.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about your expectations for cost trends going into the end of the year and then to next year and how you expect to be pricing for that cost trend for next year in the commercial side of the business?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure, I think Dan Schumacher will respond to this.","Daniel Schumacher","Good morning, Peter. Thank you for the question. On the medical cost side, I'd tell you, in the quarter, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter both in aggregate as well as across each of our businesses. And frankly, it was a little bit better than we expected, and you can see that in the care ratio. You can see it in a little stronger prior-period development relative to the last couple of quarters. Each year, we set a trend expectation, respectful, mindful of underlying medical costs, and then we endeavor to outperform it, and we have strong medical cost management disciplines that we apply, and you're seeing us outperform that this year. As you look at our full year commercial cost trend for 2014, we expect to perform at the low end of our range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, possibly a little bit better. As you look into next year on the cost side, we expect similar themes, and we'll go through the specifics of that with you at the Investor Conference, but certainly, a major component of that will be unit cost, as it is every year. It represents anywhere from 2\/3 to 3\/4 of the underlying cost trend, and that's something that is founded on negotiations that are happening each day every day. So we've got very good line of sight on that. With respect to pricing, I'd ask Jeff Alter to comment on that.","Jeff Alter","Morning, Peter. We've had a very successful long-term pricing discipline, so nothing's changed in our philosophy. We continue, as Dan mentioned, to be very mindful of cost trend. It's the #1 driver of our premium, and we've got a lot of programs in place to outperform those medical forecasts. That's a big underlier, and there's a lot of other things that make up the price: provider network, product attributes, business mix. But we're not changing our discipline. It's been very successful for us, and we expect it to continue to be very successful for us into the future.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to clarify, are you guys saying that you expect cost trend to be the same next year as it was this year? Or are you just saying that -- similar to this year?","Jeff Alter","Similar themes.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, Peter, similar in approach. We tend to view our costs as we enter the year. We tend to endeavor to outperform them. We continue to be -- to see medical cost trends and inflation going forward, and we position ourselves to price accordingly. All of that is completely consistent with the way we have approached the business for the last several years, no different, and we don't plan on changing that in '15.","John S. Penshorn","Peter, it's John Penshorn. We'll be fully detailed on this on December 2. We're really not trying to walk through 2015 today. So I think we'll be able to fully answer that question here in just a few weeks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You've had great growth in Medicaid, and David suggests that the expansion population's pretty young and healthy. Could you speak to where your Medicaid book of business is coming in this year and your expectations for next year with respect to that book?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, Austin, do you want to comment?","Austin Pittman","Yes, thanks for the question. Well, first of all, we're very pleased with the growth. We are honored to have the opportunity to work with this new population, help them guide through the healthcare system. We expected higher utilization in the expansion population. In almost every case, we got paid for that higher expectation of cost, and that's what we've seen. So we expect long term for the population to perform in that 3% to 5% margin and are very confident about the continued growth.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And what do the rates look like for that population next year and the profitability for that book directionally?","John S. Penshorn","Sure. Again, we expect the rates will be appropriate for the population and support long-term sustainability. We work hand-in-hand with our states across all the markets to ensure that on an ongoing basis that that's the case, and everything seems to be showing up as we expected.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And we have long said that the margin ranges for those businesses are in a 3% to 5% zone, and that's kind of how they're playing out.","Operator","Our next question is from David Windley of Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So slightly nearer-term question. If I look at the ranges and point estimates that you've given on factors like your medical cost ratio for '14, operating costs at kind of 16, 7 and even to a lesser import, your tax rate, it would seem that one or more of those would need to trend below what you've most recently said to get to your guidance range. I'm wondering which of those I should focus on as performing better, if you could elaborate, please.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, my reaction to that question is I would stand back and look at the totality of the business. If you take a look at the spectrum of UnitedHealth Group, and that's who we are speaking to, you have the continued performance of the Optum business. We have a very strong Medicaid business in terms of its growth. We have an international business that we think will make a meaningful contribution going into next year. We have been historically very strong in our operating cost disciplines and have structured those programs for across the expanse of our businesses. I think we have nice momentum coming in our Medicare business and our commercial business. So I wouldn't lay it out to one factor or try to basically triangulate on a ratio that, really, when you have a business as diversified and as expansive as this one. So that's why I think that that's perhaps the perspective you should look at as into '15.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Optum's always been a source of growth. But this quarter, it really seem to stand out particularly in growth in the external revenue for OptumInsight as well as improvements in the OptumRx margins. Maybe you touched on it briefly in the prepared, but I was hoping you could dig in a little bit further and talk about some of the programs you have in place driving that and how we should think about the potential of continued improvements there.","Stephen J. Hemsley","We'd be pleased to. Larry, can you start that off?","Larry C. Renfro","Sure. Sarah, it's Larry Renfro. Let me break it into 3 areas, and I think it'll -- we'll get -- as John has said many times, we'll get more into detail about this at the Investor Conference, but this might help you get ready for the Investor Conference. Obviously, last year, at the previous Investor Conference and into this year, we've been talking about investing in the future, especially in OptumHealth and in OptumInsight. We had that all planned, and we've absorbed, obviously, the impact, and all of our financials are in line as we continue to finish off the investment or the development in these new programs. I think in the third quarter, you saw that OptumHealth went to a 14% top line growth and 16% bottom line growth year-over-year. You also saw that the OptumInsight went 4% up on the top line and 6% up on the bottom line. So what you're starting to see is what we said would happen during the year that our investments are starting to tail off, and as a result, really, our outcomes are starting to kick in. So we believe that, that will create a strong fourth quarter as Steve referenced in his remarks. The second part of this answer is that we are obviously going after 10 large accounts that we have identified that we would do by 2016. We have probably as many sales metrics as we do financial metrics in Optum, so we are in line with all those sales metrics as we go forward. I'd say, too, that you might want to look at that would really tell you something would be our backlog. That backlog is at $7.7 billion, up 20 -- 21% year-over-year, and our sales pipeline, that's up 166% year-over-year. So that's the second part of the answer. The third part on the growth would be the 5 areas of focus that we're really concentrating on now, and this would be in the future as well. That's medical groups, Optum360, the PBM, international and the government business. So I think that if you kind of go back to the question you asked, I think we're pretty well positioned for growth, and we're pretty much hitting on all these programs.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just a follow-up, the margin improvement in OptumRx, should we think about this as being the new bar for that segment? Or is there further upside from this?","Larry C. Renfro","So OptumRx had a great quarter. And I think if you go back to this, what we were talking about a few minutes ago in terms of investing in the future, that's what we did a couple of years ago when we built a platform and started the process of moving the business in health. That's been a great move on our part. What I would say is what the margin really does is validate the guidance that we've been giving, that 3% to 4%, and I think we'll expand upon that more at Investor Day.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dirk, you want to add anything?","Dirk C. McMahon","Yes. Sarah, it's Dirk. What I would say is if you look at the third quarter, the major driver of the better margin was things that we did in executing a direct purchasing acquisition strategy. Really, at the gross margin line is where we have favorable uptick in the quarter...","Stephen J. Hemsley","And those should be sustainable.","Dirk C. McMahon","Correct. And as Larry said, we'll stick with 3% to 4% in the long term op margin perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In the release in your prepared, you suggested and talked about sort of retrained utilization, and obviously, the MLR performance would suggest that as well. Just hoping you can maybe provide a little bit more on specific inpatient and maybe outpatient metrics, if you're seeing any change on sort of QE [ph] levels. Any measurements there would be helpful. And then just last quarter, you said MLR would track at the higher end of guidance. Is that still the case?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, we don't actually ever get into those kinds -- that level of granular statistics, but I think we can give you some commentary to give you some sense.","Daniel Schumacher","Sure. Good morning, Ralph, this is Dan Schumacher. On utilization, specifically, as we've mentioned, we continue to see very stable trends across our businesses, which is to say that we see the same comparable increases in 2014 as compared to 2013. As you look at the componentry underneath it, obviously, pharmacy is higher in the hep C category, and that's being offset -- more than offset by better performance in inpatient, in particular, followed by physician and outpatient. Our medical cost management plays a very significant role in this. As I've said earlier, we do set expectations and then endeavor to outperform them, and we're doing that this year. I think some of the other things that are probably contributing to the performance in utilization is certainly some greater consumer responsibility and higher concentrations of value-based reimbursement, and again, those are things that are a significant focus of our enterprise. So overall, very stable utilization pattern. I think, perhaps, people ask how do we know, and looking at external data and so forth, and I'll tell you, as Steve said in the prepared remarks, you look at -- we have 41,000 people in any given day in a facility, and we have 2,000 people, they wake up every morning, and they look at who's going to be admitted, who has been admitted, how long they've been there, what they're being treated for, and most importantly, working with them, their family and their caregivers on appropriate discharge plan so that they can be successful when they leave. And all of that is enabled by near realtime technology, and we're going to have an opportunity to show that to you at the Investor Conference. So that's what we're seeing on the utilization front.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, thanks, and then just MLR guidance?","Larry C. Renfro","MLR guidance, again, I think we'd reiterate comments from last quarter, which is to say we'd expect to be near the higher end of the range on both the consolidated and the commercial ratios, albeit a little bit better than what we were thinking leaving the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just to ask you about the international business. It looks like there's acceleration in top line performance at Amil this quarter. I know there were some issues around government changes down there and utilization and so forth. Are you pretty much back to where you want it to be at a normalized operating trend? And then more broadly, I guess you guys have been mentioned in several international sales situations. Can you comment on your appetite for international deals at this point and whether your thinking's evolved in what you might or might not do?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, we are basically coming around the bend on a full year in terms of the changes in Brazil, and I think that they are -- we see some pretty positive sense in terms of that marketplace. And I'll have Dave comment on that and the others.","David S. Wichmann","Thanks, A.J. Thanks for the question. I think what you're noticing in Amil is what we notice as well, is it's beginning to show tangible results from the various initiatives that we put in place largely in response to this ANS regulatory change, which happened just over 1 year ago. As you know, there was a lag on the market's ability to respond to that change. So one of the things we had to do was ensure that all of our plans were in good standing, get our renewals up, and so even in the face of declining membership, which is largely around dealing with high costs of block of business, if you will, we are showing strong revenue growth, which is largely a reflection of the activities we have underway with respect to getting renewals in place in response to that regulatory change. We're also pursuing managing our costs, and they're coming out, and we're making, I think, all the right changes to the business, and notably, our hospitals continue to perform very well as well. So it will take some time, A.J., to work our way through this. It will be maybe all the way to the end of '15 till we get to what I would characterize as a more normalized level of profitability in the business, but we clearly see line of sight towards that. As it relates to the international markets and our appetite there, yes, we are active predominately in Brazil, predominantly in the healthcare delivery space, predominantly in the long lines that I described before, which is to move beyond the centers of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro into the contiguous cities, if you will, and then also to pursue growth in the Northeast part of that country. Our efforts there have gone very well. And then, of course, we have other interests internationally, but I'd say most of those are aimed towards the South America and Latin American markets. And then as we think about more broadly across the globe as well as in those 2 markets, we see great opportunity for Optum, which we are just beginning to pursue.","Operator","Next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to take a step back just on the benefits business and the M&A landscape, and it's been, I think, 2 years now since there's been any major M&A on the benefit side, and it's been even longer for United. So I'm just curious, is there a reason for this pause? Is there something in the market that changed with reform? Is it just an unsure landscape as to who the winners and the losers are in some of the benefits business? Just maybe your perspectives on M&A, maybe even broadly beyond UNH, just in the benefit segment specifically.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I'll just comment that, perhaps, the highest levels certainly with the healthcare reform efforts that have been going forward, I could easily see this marketplace being fairly occupied in making sure that this is -- everybody in this space that they are prepared to and responding to the changing regulatory landscape and to make sure that they're pursuing the opportunities and managing the challenges that those regulatory changes brought forward. And I think that it continues to go forward. I think it's been a very successful first year across the industry in terms of how that has been responded to.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And when are you left occupied with those responses?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, I think my view is that this year was, by far, the most amount of changes, but they're going to have to be digested in the marketplace over the next 2 to 3 years. But I would not necessarily suggest then that there'll be a time when there will be market activities around M&A -- begin to pick up and so forth. I'm not sure I would necessarily -- when we take a look at the expanse of our business, we are well diversified across our benefits business, continue to be interested in growing that and making sure it continues to innovate and drive value from an organic point of view and to be in a position that where we see opportunities to expand that business that makes sense, that lie into our strategic path, that bring capabilities, that bring market positions or scale. That we will -- we would have an interest, and I would imagine others will as well. We have opportunities to also allocate capital to services and to international markets, and we will have to assess those as well. So I don't think it's -- my sense is that it requires a little bit more thoughtful reflection than just when will the reform run its course or not. And I think that I'm impressed that across the space, the businesses have been mature in terms of how they responded, and I think everybody is focused at the opportunities at hand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to add 2 quick ones, just first, how much of the $200 million and the targeted Optum investment spend has now been completed through the 3Q? And how much remains for the fourth quarter? And then just secondly, just I know it's very small for you guys in the overall context of things, but just interested on Texas Medicaid. That's been one of the states that has still been reticent to cover the industry fee. And we've heard some mixed feedback from different plans on whether they expect to get paid on that or not. So definitely very interested in whether you've heard something from Texas on whether you're going to get recouped for the industry fee this year.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So that will go from one side to the other. So John, you want to respond to the first?","John Rex","Yes. Scott, John Rex here. So yes, correct. We've talked in the first half about the investments that we've been making, particularly within the OptumInsight and OptumHealth businesses, and we sized that up in the first half at $140 million, talked about $200 million or more for the full year in terms of anticipating in investing those businesses. So in the 3Q, we would have invested an additional $60 million, so we hit our $200 million. I do anticipate that we will continue to spend in the fourth quarter, albeit, at a diminished rate. However, that is within the scope of our guidance where we've talked about our comfort with the high end of our $3.2 billion earnings range.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Austin?","Austin Pittman","Sure, thanks for the question. I guess, first of all, I'd comment that we had great progress, as you know, in getting arrangements and agreements in place with our states on the recovery of this fee. There is one instance, as you mentioned, that we don't have written agreement yet. We do expect to be paid. We expect all of these to come in before the end of the year. We haven't recorded revenue in that one instance, but we feel very good overall.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple quick questions on the individual exchange business. I want to clarify something first. You said that you expect it to be slightly below kind of the longer-term margin in that business of 3% to 5%. But I think in the past, you've talked about pricing that business to profitability kind of excluding the 3 Rs, not relying on them to make a profit. And I would think that if you are pricing that way, then with the 3 Rs, you would be at least at the -- that average number. So I just want to clarify that before a follow-up on the exchanges.","Jeff Alter","Kevin, it's Jeff Alter. Yes, so we're not exclusive of all of these Rs, so we would not rely on corridors. We will, obviously, rely on the reinsurance and the risk adjustment. Risk adjustment is a big part of it. So while we will get into that 3%, probably closer to the 5% as the market matures, we also recognize that it's still a market in development, and our competitors that are already in the marketplace, we need to be able to come in at a price point that attracts a little bit of growth but still profitability, and then build into that marketplace. So this is a long-term build for us but -- so just clarifying, we will not rely on corridors, but the other Rs are important parts of that business, and risk adjustment will always be an important part of that.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So is this a clarification then or is this something that now that you've seen the pricing and everything else that it's a little bit different? Or -- I just wasn't sure.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Kevin, this is Gail Boudreaux. I just want to sort of add on to Jeff's comment about what he said. I mean, it's not so much a clarification. It's always been our long-term strategy. We see this market as a really good growth -- long-term growth opportunity. As we said in the last several calls, we don't expect to rely on subsidies as part of that, and we are pricing to profitability. But in any new market, as you enter a market, we don't necessarily think that we'll see our 3% to 5% earnings range in the first year. And again, remember, 75% of this market has yet to develop, and we are seeing it firm and stabilize a little bit, but it's still only the second year in the market. But overall, we went into this market with an expectation of earning a profit in it.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, because that was going to be my real question, was just how do you think the [indiscernible] market is going to evolve in 2015? I mean, do you think the CBO target of $13 million makes sense? And then how do you think about your positioning as, I guess, a strong second mover versus the incumbents? I mean, in retrospect, if you had known that membership would be 7.3 million, would you have been more aggressive in year 1? Or I guess just any thoughts there.","Stephen J. Hemsley","No, no. We like where we are, or we would have played this just exactly as we have. We think the second vintage will be better. The third vintage will be better after that. This market will form. It will be different market by market. It will take time for it to evolve. It will eventually evolve into about the profit margin range that we have been discussing. We're not going to comment on CBO. We have no idea from that point of view whose projections are correct. So far, all we can say is everybody's projections have been wrong. And so we will just play this and participate as we see this market evolve, which has been completely consistent with our perspective on this, and we do anticipate too that we will participate in this a way that is sustainable from a growth and profitability point of view, but we don't have that kind of mature margin assumption in your first couple years of participation, and we really don't have a lot of this into our 15-year outlook, but this is really just our introduction. We expect to participate. We expect to grow, but we're not expecting tremendous profit out of that first year participation. So I think that's ought to be the way you think about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So one of your peers just pulled out of the Delaware Medicaid program over a rate disagreement. I believe you're the only other MCO in the program. So first of all, do you expect to enroll the 130 members next year? And then more broadly, how are your rate discussions going for Medicaid next year in the areas of pushback on rates?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Austin?","Austin Pittman","This is Austin. Thanks for the question. We do have an agreement in place with Delaware. We look forward to continuing to serve the people of Delaware and stay focused on being ready to do that. I won't speculate on -- at this early date on where that membership will play out, but overall, we continue to feel confident in our relationships with our states, our ability and proven track record in working with states to really serve those populations and deliver that long-term sustainability in that 3% to 5% margin.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And the states see value in that. These are complex programs. They're invested in them, and Medicaid programs are continuing to establish themselves very well.","Austin Pittman","Yes, I think the great growth that we've seen this year and our ability to work year-over-year with states is a reflection of the trust they've put in us to serve their populations.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And I think Medicaid has been one of the strong successes of the ACA effort.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","The question's on the employer market and mix shift potentially in 2015 given the data points of Walmart, which dumped, I think, 30,000 workers. Some of your competitors are talking about small group under 10 dumping into exchanges. But on the flip side, the private exchange market and adoption's been slower from the recent [indiscernible] data points, and there's an employer mandate 1\/1\/2015. So are you looking at '15 as a big year of mix shift? And is there potential for disproportionate share gains for you because the band stickiness is not that great? And what are you assuming in your soft 2015 EPS guide of kind of in line with consensus?","Stephen J. Hemsley","That's quite a question. Gail, do you want to start?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. That is quite a question. There's a number of things embedded. Let me first talk about the mix shift question you had, and take it in a couple of parts. The first, let me deal with your question on small employer dumping. We don't -- we have not seen a lot of that. We don't really expect an acceleration in that given how reform has laid out in some of the offerings that are still in the marketplace. So I don't expect any significant increase in dumping, although we do expect some decline in the mark, which has been happening over time but not a significant dumping. In terms of the overall market, you mentioned employers getting rid of or taking down their part-time employees. Let me start with our expectations around the large marketplace. Overall, the national account marketplace has been -- we feel positive about that marketplace. We're pleased with our competitive position in it, and we do expect better results in '14 than in '13. We had a stronger close ratio. But with that, getting to your second question, we do have a very focused strategy when there's an opportunity in exchanges to help convert some of our self-funded business to fully insure the exchanges, and we are seeing some of that, which comes out of our commercial enrollment. And the other sector of the market that's happening is the retiree population is moving from the self-funded book of business, particularly in our national accounts, to our Medicare advantage, our Medicare supplement and our Part D products. And again, we've been very successful in that in '14, and we expect to be successful in '15. That's been a very specific strategy. So those are the kind of changes going on in the market, and we feel good about our positioning in that.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'd say just the expanse, the diversification of our benefits offerings suggest that even if there are shifts in the marketplace, we're really well positioned to accommodate those shifts and I think pretty agile in that context.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the cost trend, so sub 5% last year, a little bit under 5.5% this year. Can you walk through what's accounting for that, call it, 50 basis point increase this year versus 2013?","Daniel Schumacher","Sure, Carl, this is Dan Schumacher. One of the primary elements of the increase year-over-year is reform related. We talked about that at the investor conference last December, that as people moved into richer plans complied with community rating and so forth that was one of the elements that -- principal elements that drove the increase.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you. So I think we will close, and as we close today, I'd like to remind you that 2014 performance across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare remains strong through the first 9 months of the year, and we expect to continue that consistent performance through the rest of 2014 and to remain in line with or ahead of our outlook that we shared with you today. And in 2015 and beyond, we expect our overall business performance will further strengthen and accelerate both top line and bottom line. And we look forward to sharing more detail with you around 2015 performance at the Investor Conference on December 2 in New York. So thank you for your attention today.

","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. ","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This quarter, we are privileged to report continued broad-based revenue and earnings growth, consistent execution and continuing forward momentum for our enterprise. We serve people's health and healthcare, a sensitive, social and personal domain that we know requires a mission and values-driven culture and a commitment to a quality experience, getting that experience right the first time for each individual we serve. We are advancing consciously and steadily in this direction. More to do to achieve the full potential and positive impact we can have on people's lives, on an access, cost and quality of care.","We work to improve overall healthcare system performance through clinical insight, enabling technologies and distinctive data analytics, applying those capabilities across our businesses. This long-standing approach, consistently executed, continues to produce distinctive quality outcomes, balanced growth and steady financial performance. Third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew nearly $5 billion over last year or 12%. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $2.17 per share. Third quarter adjusted cash flows of $3.4 billion increased 22% over last year. And third quarter return on equity exceeded 21%. ","Looking forward, we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter and into 2017. That performance will be built on strong customer retention and broad-based growth across our businesses, driven by deeper and more strategic relationships and new business awards already received. To take you deeper, Larry Renfro will discuss Optum's third quarter performance and then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry? ","Larry Renfro","Thank you, Steve. At Optum, we are pleased, once again, to report solid results for the third quarter and the year so far, with positive business momentum as we head into 2017. The market continues to affirm Optum's distinctive position as a scaled and broadly capable health services and innovation Company. We have aligned our resources to address enduring market trends around helping make this health system work better. We have strengthened fundamental capabilities, deepened relationships across the industry, including unique collaborations like OptumLabs and built a reputation for reliable service, even in challenging situations. And we balance investments in our core capabilities with the expectation that we consistently deliver operating earnings and returns on capital. ","This quarter, we again closed several large, long term business awards. Quest Diagnostics has asked Optum360 to be their partner for revenue management, covering everything following the receipt of doctors' lab orders through billing and cash collections from health plans, payers and consumers. In collaboration with Quest, our analytics, processing approaches and technology can further modernize their business processes, improve service, lower cost, improve access to clinical and financial information and heighten transparency for consumers. Hospitals and acute-care facilities continue to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology.","The number of facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion within them. A recent BlackRock market research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and\/or replacing their approach to revenue management over the next few years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at BlackRock have ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle management outsourcing and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions. During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion in annual customer billings.","This quarter, consulting leader Frost & Sullivan named Optum the top population health management company in the nation, based on their assessment of the Optum One technology. Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of people. Proprietary analytics are applied to healthcare providers, identify and take action with patients who are at highest risk of adverse health developments. Today, nearly 700 facilities and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One, growth of 28% year over year. We see a broad range of opportunities in helping enable ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value.","OptumHealth revenues continue to grow strongly, led by OptumCare Local Care Delivery. OptumCare leverages modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients, payers and physicians. Aligning care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level; in fact, perhaps nowhere else can the potential benefits of individuals be as profound. And while OptumCare already comprises more than half of OptumHealth's revenues, we are still early in developing this business. You should expect to see us continue to build out OptumCare market by market to emerge as a national platform for primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside.","This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion-dollar award from the Veterans Administration to conduct medical disability exams for servicemen and women for a period of up to five years. This award highlights some of the unique services we can offer governments as customers and shows how the diversity of our capabilities and customer segments drives overall growth. OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible.","OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets in care management, clinical insights and population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this approach is particularly evident in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market. And we are still only in the early stages in the evolution of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well and expects to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January 2017 will be in the high 90%s.","OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year over year to $12.6 billion and script growth at OptumRx and the number of people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations. Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year over year to approach $1.5 billion. Year-to-date earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.9% expanded both sequentially and year-over-year, led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued investments in the OptumHealthcare Delivery businesses. We recognize Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects and requiring continued investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better and in turn, help %s make the health system work better for more people. ","Now, let me turn it over to Dave. ","Dave Wichmann","Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again, with solid growth across all three domestic medical markets. This continues the remarkable organic growth trend at UnitedHealthcare. Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive product and service capabilities, data-driven consumer engagement and decision resources and modern value-based relationships with care providers, supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers while containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors.","Our full-year commercial medical cost trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. The market continues to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual plans offer. Excluding individual plans, our Commercial Group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year over year continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In six of the past seven calendar years, our Employer & Individual business has grown the number of consumers served, with cumulative growth across all products, totaling in the millions of people, all of it organic. In the seniors' market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirements performance continues to strengthen each year.","In the past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer Net Promoter Scores. The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks and a distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction or NPS and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, Stars performance and the use of healthcare resources, all leading to better value for seniors.","Our Medicare Advantage Plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated four stars or higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%. This quarter, our Group retiree call centers achieved JD Power's certification, placing them among the highest-performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality healthcare and flawless service. We expect 2017 to be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA. We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017, with the introduction of a new nationwide product set, targeted to a broader senior demographic.","Our community and state plans have grown steadily in response to state governments' needs, to improve quality for beneficiaries, while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of more Americans and using public funds in the most effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years, including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months. Our commitment to quality care, outcomes and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving programs for dual eligible beneficiaries and those who need long term services and support. ","Today, we serve more than 0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers and our growth in these categories continues. This past quarter, we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia, in what will be another new state partner for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our community and state business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever. ","Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues of $37.2 billion, grew 13.3% year-over-year, with organic growth, again, across the three businesses. The same organic growth has been experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter 2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year over year on steady operating margins of 5.7%. ","Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first nine months of the year, our medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year. The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year to date, to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular, seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as well as increased level of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth. ","As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year over year and were supported by distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion or 1.4 times net income and adjusted cash flow was 1.7 times net income in the third quarter. We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that momentum into 2017. ","At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year. And we look forward to discussing our 2017 outlook with you in depth at our Investor conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion for another six weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted earnings per share are currently positioned on the Street. ","We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now, we will maintain an appropriately prudent posture. Steve? ","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you, Dave. I think at this point, it's important to acknowledge something we don't do enough and that's the tremendous effort of our employees and the efforts they make to bring our mission into the day-to-day reality of helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. They exhibit the values we share across this Company as they do that work, values of integrity, compassion, innovation, relationships and performance. Our thanks to their commitment and hard work. ","As we move toward 2017, our enterprise is well-positioned. You can hear the optimism in Larry and Dave's commentary today and see it in the consistency of our performance. Our businesses are aligned to important market trends and delivering value to the increasing number of customers and people we serve. There is still a long way to go to serve at the peak of our potential. It is up to us to execute and we are privileged to have that opportunity. ","Thank you for your interest this morning. Operator, we can now take questions. Again, one per analyst, please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch","I just wanted to ask on the outlook for the rest of the year for Optum, is it still your expectation that you will have about 60% of the earnings growth weighted to the back half? I'm asking because it's -- looks like that's going to be a pretty big sequential jump implied in the Optum earnings or margins, at least from how we're modeling it. If you could comment on that and maybe if there's anything you can tell us about the organic change that you've seen year to date in the Optum non-intersegment revenues. It's just challenging to track that. ","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. I think those patterns are pretty consistent with prior periods, but Larry, do you want to take that and then maybe John Rex or whatever, we'll finish off. But Larry, do you want to start? ","Larry Renfro","A couple things, I think past history in terms of how our business is lined up this way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going to pretty much play out this way and I will talk about that in a minute. The third quarter, strong quarter for us. It met expectations and we are exactly where we expect it to be right now in terms of our in-line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality and when we get into the seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentives and our shared savings. What we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and impacts us during the fourth quarter.","The number of new accounts that we have, as well as AEP kicks in; some of our coding kicks in. So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter, but what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large, what I will call, complex relationships and when we get into that and this is all part of how we build this during the year, we expected to have around 10 of these major relationships. We are probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has been building over the last few years.","We have three measurements that kick into this as well and that is our backlog. And I think I mentioned this a few minutes ago on inside of about $12.6 billion; that's up about 24% year over year. We had our qualified sales pipeline that will also kick in, possibly during the fourth quarter. That's up about 2 times over last year. And the third area is our sales for this year. What I call our TCV, our total contract value; that's up about 3 times. So we're confident where we're at right now for the fourth quarter.","We believe the fourth quarter will give us momentum into 2017 so we're right where we expect it to be. I will tell you that this time next year, if we're sitting here, we will be having the same conversation because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the fourth quarter. ","John Rex","Yes, absolutely expect those seasonal patterns to continue, as we've seen over the years. If anything, when you think about where the bias of sales to and growth is within the Optum businesses, that should be an actual outcome in terms of that seasonality persisting. So what you want to think about there in terms of businesses that have that type of pattern, think about some of the quality solutions businesses, data sales and analytics, the timing and delivery of the large deals and certainly, seeing plenty of large deals across the spectrum this year, some of the networks solutions businesses. All of those businesses are typically second-half weighted in terms of their performance and that's a pattern that we would expect to persist. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Appreciate the early view on 2017 and you talked about being comfortable with consensus EPS which implies of about 14% year-over-year growth with potential for upside given the business momentum. When we adjust for the benefit of exiting the ACA individual market for next year, that growth looks closer to about 9% to 10%, if I'm doing the math right. Just curious in terms of how you think about the main headwinds and tailwinds year over year we should consider when thinking that growth rate relative to your long term growth expectations. ","Dave Wichmann","So as you said, we will discuss 2017 at our Investor Conference in November. I think the largest tailwind for the business, as you're probably picking up, is growth, both at Optum which you've seen pretty systemically throughout the year, with the PDM wins and obviously, here with the Quest win which is Optum360 win as well as and I'll call a lot of the smaller business size wins that occur in that business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All of those things speak to Optum's growth and I think UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well understood with the pattern of growth and its membership across all three lines of business.","The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA. That clearly will aid earnings in 2017 as well. On the headwinds front, obviously with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur and then as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range and serve in more market segments as well. So there's a lot of de novo start-up costs, if you will, in that business as well as a lot of implementation costs for the substantive business that we've won over time. ","The last thing I guess I would point out in 2017, particularly, at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we're -- we may be more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage, this organization has a deep respect for medical costs and trend. And while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're deeply respectful of medical costs as well as the rating environment. As those things become clearer, that's when I think you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017 and that could be as early in the 2017 Investor Conference in November. ","Stephen Hemsley","Our commentary today was an attempt to be pretty positive about 2017 and I think the commentary about if momentum continues and we have every reason to believe that it will, l that we can be even stronger, but I really think that whole conversation really should -- is better had more face-to-face at the Investor Conference. So our purpose today is to give you some positive body language on 2017, but really the further conversation is at the Investor Conference. So if you kind of take it from that spirit, that's the right way. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","I wanted to ask a question around OptumRx and drug costs trend. If you could comment on your views, generally about drug costs trend and then within your OptumRx business, are you seeing or are you deploying particular strategies that you think are delivering a competitively better drug cost trend? Or should I think about the competitive differentiation being through the synchronization function and seeing savings elsewhere in medical benefits as you are interacting with pharmacy members? Thanks. ","Larry Renfro","I think the answer to that is really both and I think the distinctive dimensions of the OptumRx business is that they are really kind of redefining pharmacy care services to be much more integrated into the clinical continuum, to have impact on medical costs and to engage earlier. At the same time, be able to bring leading-edge perspectives to the procurements of a drug and supply chain. So Mark, do you want to comment? ","Mark Thierer","I appreciate the question and I would say that the one thing our clients are focused on and hiring us to do is to manage their pharmacy costs. One of the reasons I'm excited about this business is there is no one in the industry who has the data, analytic and delivery assets, really, that Optum possesses and so you mentioned synchronization. And as you know, this is a data-driven approach. It's been central to the wins that we posted this year from some very large and sophisticated buyers. So this is a new approach and we do think we're redefining pharmacy care services, taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking it to the care delivery process and including lab, behavioral data in a comprehensive data set.","We call it, [indiscernible] and the whole business is focused on now a whole-person approach. How can we take everything we know about a member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cross trend management strategies, that you mentioned, but much more than that, delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by pharmacist, housecalls by nurses.","This could include adherence programs; it's a full suite of programs, all aimed at driving down total medical costs. And so I would say that's one thing that is setting us apart in the market. We're feeling very good about where we stand in our position and we can see it in our pipeline and the growth opportunities that we're chasing. So thank you for the question. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel","Can you maybe give us some more detail on why you directed the increased level of investments that you mentioned as raising the operating cost ratio? How much spending was not previously planned and incremental to the third quarter and also, is there anything incremental planned in Q4 that you even had planned earlier in the year? ","John Rex","Just a little bit on OCR. First of all, I would say that in line with our view here in terms of how we trended in the 3Q, so the first perspective being from 2Q to 3Q, there was a sequential increase of about 60 basis points in the OCR and that is typical of what we see as we move into the open enrollment period and the investments and spend to prepare for that as the season began. So that is a typical move. And I think you're referring particularly to the year-over-year move of a 30 basis point increase. That's, as you stated, primarily driven by increased investments. I cite a few places where we were making investments in the quarter. ","Things you may have heard us referred to in the past and maybe you've been familiar with, the ongoing Stars investments, medical affordability and clinical investments, specific businesses that we've been very vocal on in terms of where we expect to grow and invest such as the OptumCare businesses. And then I would put up costs related to preparing for the growth we expect in 2017 across a number of the businesses, within our senior businesses, in M&R, some of the Optum businesses where you've seen there have been very -- some significant new business awards for next year as we prepare for that. Just a general upward pressure also that we see fee comparisons growth.","All of this, as you would expect from us normally on offset partially by the productivity gains that we've logged. So within our expectations, if I sum it up and those are the types of investments that we're making. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ralph Jacoby from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Jacoby","I was hoping you could maybe just walk through the favorable development in the quarter. They came off last quarter that had an unfavorable development from both current and prior year and this quarter obviously had favorable, particularly in the first half. So our estimates last quarter is essentially overly conservative on the exchange specifically. But also sort of the unfavorable development from last year; just hoping you could flush out all those moving parts and maybe which end markets are impacted? Thanks. ","Dan Schumacher","So maybe I will start broadly on medical costs overall. From our view, certainly in the quarter, costs were well controlled and as you look at the consolidated medical care ratio, it was 80.3% in the third quarter this year and that's actually down 60 basis points year over year, so down a little bit more than we had expected. So we continue to do well managing costs across the portfolio within UnitedHealthcare. To the components of development specifically, so underneath that, we did have prior period reserve development in the quarter. That was about $120 million and that was favorable. That's pretty consistent with the development we recorded in the same quarter last year. As you look of the pieces inside of it, to your question, the current year component was favorable $230 million and that was partially offset by $110 million of prior-year unfavorable developments.","With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the Exchanges, frankly and it's more about our core businesses across Medicare\/Medicaid and our Commercial business, both the current year favorable as well as the prior-year favorable. And on the prior-year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that resolve in any given quarter. There was nothing in this quarter that was individually material and that prior-year element does not influence our current or our future outlook on trends. So as we look to the full-year and look at our medical costs, we expect the medical care ratio of 81.5% on the full year, plus or minus 50 basis points and I would probably tell you it would likely orient below that midpoint. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","My question is on the margins in the Medicare business. Last year, you had higher spending for Medicare Star scores that impacted your Medicare performance. This year, did that spending continue at the same level or does it come down a little bit? And then going into next year, how do you plan to utilize the HIF holiday given that the health insurance fee comes back in 2018 so what should I think about for a trended margins last year to this year to next year to 2018? ","Steve Nelson","I will start by just giving a broad perspective on how we think about 2017 as we enter -- I think we're three days into our annual enrollment period for 2017. I really think we are well-positioned overall. As you mentioned, we've seen improvement in our Stars and when we contemplated our benefit planning, back in the Spring, we obviously considered that, had insight into that and also the insurers' fee moratorium as well. That allowed us to make some meaningful investments and bring to market some stable benefits that we're really excited to offer to our seniors. ","It's meaningful to them, the stability and premiums and co-pays and choice. We think we're really well-positioned. Then you add to that the capabilities that we've been investing in as well in terms of our quality which benefits our members but also, something that we're going to stay diligent about.","We also have, I think, Dave mentioned in his opening comments, some of the distinguished capabilities that we have in our member experience and service, so all of these positions leave room for growth but in terms of the margin specifically, we wanted the positions business for growth and we think we have done that. The margins we target between 3% and 5%, we're operating toward the upper end of that range at this point and expect to continue to do that in 2017. ","Stephen Hemsley","We think we spent more on Stars, but we also get benefits from Stars, the performance in Stars has really been highlighted and-- ","Steve Nelson","Yes. On the Stars-specific investment question I would say that we -- this time last year, actually, we were talking about investments, strategic investments we were making in Stars and we continue at about the same level looking for more effectiveness, more efficiency and some productivity gains. But generally, at the same level, don't expect that to initially increase, but we are getting really strong returns and we're very excited about the performance and the results that we're seeing in Stars. ","Stephen Hemsley","Very stable, so stability is the order of the day in terms of approach. This is a business that was challenging a few years back and has been brought back into line. So very positive. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Scott Fidel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Scott Fidel","Interested if you can give us an update on how the net new business pipeline has developed for OptumRx for 2017? And then, also separately, maybe an update on the commercial side in terms of how the national accounts' selling season ended up shaping up for you guys? ","Stephen Hemsley","So that is a two-part question. Mark, do you want to take the first part? ","Mark Thierer","Well, we feel pretty good about the scorecard from 2016. As you know, we posted some very large wins, what I would categorize as some of the smartest and most sophisticated buyers signing on with OptumRx. I think these large wins validated our model. I mean, we've put this business together. We're a year and a few months into and I do think the strategic rationale for the combination is proving out. I think at the end of the day, the reason that we are posting these wins is, first of all, we are driving better economics in the market. That's important when you're trying to save money on drugs, but it is this differentiated model that we're selling.","The pharmacy care services model is resonating with very sophisticated buyers. I think what you're seeing, Scott, is the convergence of the traditional PBM model which we're trying to rebuild and combining it with the Optum Clinical platform. Here we're talk about OptumHealth and all of the care management, data management and care delivery services. So I think if you start to look at it, we've emerged as a sort of destination platform in this industry and feel very good about the selling season and the wins that we'll post and bring live in 2017. ","Jeff Alter","Just comment on the national accounts season. We're wrapping up that 2017 selling season now and as we've talked about in the past, this was a fairly light season for active employees and it is played out this way. We continue to be able to manage our client retention well up in the high 90%s which is a testament to the value and the relationships that the value that we bring to those clients and the relationships that we have. ","We'll probably wind up with a relatively flat membership result, when you take into account the success of our Group's MA efforts. So on that front, as I said, it was a fairly light active season but we saw a very, very robust season for Group MA and as Mark mentioned, some of the PBM offerings. ","And I think what we really showed to the marketplace is that we can take the value of this enterprise to bear on those opportunities and we are combining the unique expertise of the Commercial business, our Medicare business and our OptumRx business and bringing really seamless solutions to the marketplace for our clients. And we've produced a very successful result for the 2017 selling season for both our Group MA business and our OptumRx business. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","I just want to talk about capital deployment and specifically, share buybacks. I know you guys have been intent on reducing your leverage this year, but looks like it was relatively slow in the first half and really fell off again in the third quarter so I guess I'm curious one, was there something in the market that give you pause around share buybacks? And then how do we think about 2017? Is that a more normal return to a more normal pattern for UnitedHealth Group? ","Larry Renfro","I think we're completely in line with our plan and pattern so we don't view this as anything of that nature and we have reduced debt, so I think it's all line with plan. John? ","John Rex","Josh, particularly on share repurchase, but for the year, we had anticipated $1 billion to $1.5 billion in total share repurchase. In the first half, we did about $1 billion so we anticipated that we would be slowing meaningfully in the second half of the year. We repurchased about $140 million in the third quarter, so consistent in terms of our full-year expectations in that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. Nearer term, you're right. We've been focused on delevering our balance sheet and applying more than free cash flow to debt reduction but the pattern that you've seen this year, consistent with kind of how we've approached the year in terms of our share repurchase activities. ","Stephen Hemsley","So I don't think there's anything that's -- and nor do we plan to stray from that, so our capital allocation approaches are perfectly consistent. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","I was hoping to get a few more details on your ACA-compliant individual business and I guess, happy that it's not a big topic of conversation for the first time in a few quarters but one, wondering if you could give us both your on and off-Exchange compliant enrollment. Two, I think in the third quarter a year ago, almost 20% of the individual compliant enrollment was coming through special enrollment period. I wonder where that stood this year versus the 20% last year?","And then just finally, presumably the MLR in the first half of the year has been pressured as you booked additional full-year losses for your ACA-compliant businesses and I suppose we flip to the point where the PDR is probably now helping the medical loss ratio. So any color you could give on either how much the PDR came down or maybe even just what your MLR looks like in your ACA-compliant business this quarter versus a year ago? Just some help on what how that's shaping up versus the projected losses? ","Dan Schumacher","First, to the enrollment. So on the enrollment front, we ended the quarter with 770,000 Exchange lives and another 210,000 Off the Exchange rate, so on a combined basis, our individual ACA block was just under a shade under 1 million lives at the end of the quarter. When you look at the performance inside the quarter, I would tell you that, as you pointed out, nothing has really changed on the ACA front and that's a good thing.","Our third quarter was very much in line with our revised expectations that we set coming out of the second quarter and we continue to maintain our full-year view. To be more specific about it, so we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million and of that, $120 million was offset against the premium deficiency reserve and the remaining $80 million flowed trough the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year over year. From our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year.","I think you also asked about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that we have a little less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little shade above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year and now we're more in the mid-teens as you look at our ACA-compliant membership base. Hopefully, that covers the list. ","Operator","We will take our next question from AJ Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","AJ Rice","Probably just go back to the discussion around Optum. If I think about the announcements you've had this quarter the Quest announcement takes you into a new area for revenue cycle management, the VA contract, certainly dramatically expands the business with the government in that area. I know you've talked about DoD contracts as well and I think there's been ongoing commentary about discussions with international governments and NHS, for example. Can you just talk about the expanding opportunities that Optum has? And what are some of the pie-in-the-sky opportunities looking out two or three years for Optum? ","Stephen Hemsley","I don't think we think of them as pie-in-the-sky, but I think Larry can respond to that. ","Larry Renfro","Let me start with international and I'm going to ask a couple of people to help me out. I'll ask Bill to join into this and I might ask Amir to join in from an OptumCare standpoint and I think Mark's already covered it, but on the international front, I would say we've spent the last year-and-a-half building our foundation. We've been planting seeds and I would say that we're strong with the NHS. We're strong with NHS improvement. We are getting stronger with Minister of Health as well as the Secretary of Health. As we sit here today, we actually have the Minister of Health with us for the next two or three days on tour, with quite a few of the Commissioners of the Trust which would be hospitals, the way we would know it. ","I would say that as we've gone through this with the relationship building and where we stand, the pipeline is getting stronger and I believe that 2017 will be a year that we will validate, as we've been validating some things here in the States. So that's where I would say that the international sits in the UK. We are also working with our sister organization, Amil, in Brazil and that's more of a health plan, as you know, the way that we would approach that from our standpoint. So we're working day in, day out to line up with them. We are also looking at other emerging markets. We are looking, probably the way we would go about is look at Australia, maybe Mexico, maybe Asia, but we're going to finish out what we're doing with the UK and have a very solid start as well as in Brazil before we start to pursue other things.","Again, we've talked about that market potentially being a $500 billion market and we remain focused and confident that, that 's the size of that market. We move over into what we're doing on the, what I'll call, our large, deeper relationships and I spoke about that both in the script as well as on the other answer. Instead of me speaking on this, I'm going to ask Bill to talk about it from an OptumInsight360 standpoint and some of the large relationships we're working with and then I'm going to ask Amir to do the same on the, what I'll call, the OptumCare side. I will make one comment myself of what we're doing in the military. We were able to get this nice award with the Veterans Administration on disability exams.","So we won about 8 out of 12 regions, exactly 8 out of 12 regions. Four at LHI; that's in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. Four in California with MSLA that we own, it will service about 4.2 million servicemen and women and we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year. So, Bill? ","Bill Miller","With respect to our revenue management offerings, we've used this word, validation, a fair number of times this morning. And I think in the case of the win that we had with Quest, it just validates once again that our boundaries of where we can offer these technology-enabled services is expanding. And I think Quest represents that as one of the largest, if not the largest web diagnostic companies in the world. I think whether it's a health plan, whether it's an employer, whether it's a health system, they all go through a rigorous evaluation process and whether it's Quest or Dignity which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for modern technology, modern systems.","They are looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could reengineer workflows, that can leverage a worldwide workforce and peppering in all of that is someone who can drive analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of their own operations. And anyone that evaluates us likes to see that, one, we're comprehensive in that approach; two, we pretty much line up culturally with them and they really enjoy the fact that we drive a performance-based contract with them.","So we're very much focused on aligning ourselves with them so that they are successful. That formula is working. It's highly enabled by a very modern set of portfolios that, as Dave said, people buy every day but more and more, we're seeing a trend in the marketplace where any of those constituencies are looking for more of an end-to-end comprehensive approach to handling some of these most pronounced challenges they have in their environments and Optum becomes a pretty formidable and desirable option in those contexts. So with that said, maybe I will turn it over to Amir. ","Amir Dan Rubin","So we are continuing to see great growth on the OptumCare side. As you know, we have laid out 75 strategic markets that we see as important for ourselves to be in. We are well in over half of those markets and we continue to see growth into new markets as well as growth within those markets. And within those markets, we are seeing growth across different payer categories and were also seeing growth across the continuum of care access. ","We also continue to grow our MedExpress centers. We see great success in our consumerism approach there with MedExpress and we'll continue to expand those assets. And we also see ourselves addressing more and more complex populations, dual eligibles, of course, Medicare Advantage, special needs population as well. ","So we will continue to see that and then to find these capabilities leveraging the capabilities from OptumInsight and our analytics, risk stratification into our Care Delivery Groups and now as Larry mentioned, applying those capabilities from OptumCare and OptumInsight abroad globally. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","The quarter looks pretty good overall so I'm going to go back and harp on the one thing that I feel just doesn't look right to me which was the negative prior-year development. We're not used to seeing that from you guys at all. Now we've seen it two quarters in a row so I just wanted to understand how comfortable you are with the reserves. ","Just to get a little more color, I understand that you mentioned there's a lot of things going on and it was more the core business than Exchanges this quarter. But any color you can provide there about what was really driving that, because we're just not used to seeing it? It looks like at this rate, you may be showing some of the lowest growth development you've seen in the last decades I just wanted to understand your visibility into reserves and what's been driving that recently? ","Stephen Hemsley","I will just commentary before Dan gets to it, is that we don't really strive for the -- a formula development numbers. We try to get as accurate as possible, so if we have absolutely no development, it would absolutely actually be perfect. I think you shouldn't read anything too much into this beyond the fact that we continue to be very vigilant and making sure that our trends are appropriate, our reserves are appropriate and true things up in an appropriate timeframe. Dan, do you want to come back and comment one more time? ","Dan Schumacher","Well, Kevin, I would just add that when you put it in the context of our total medical spend, what you're seeing and, as Steve mentioned, is greater accuracy. So last year, we had worth of $100 billion of medical spend across the platform. This year, we'll be north of $115 billion and what you're seeing is, as we bring more rigor, better analytics, through a better system connectivity, we tie-in, more real-time, to delivery partners, you're seeing improvements in the accuracy of those estimates. ","And as you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we're sitting on $190 million of prior-year favorable development. That compares to $230 million for the three quarters last year. So from our perspective, there's some vagaries that happen quarter to quarter but on balance, we continue to get more accurate and for us, that's our aim. And as I mentioned at the outset, our medical costs continue to be well-controlled and they are coming in a little bit better than we expect in an aggregate, so that's great. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Baker from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Michael Baker","With the Section 1332 Waivers going into effect, January 2017, do you expect any states to meaningfully alter their approach to either addressing the broken public exchange and managing healthcare costs? ","Stephen Hemsley","I would say we should be a little bit retrospect with respect to our view of how states will approach Exchanges and how Exchanges will play out in the new administration, so we're really not interested in commenting on that. What I would say is that our agenda here has been very focused on solid opportunities for access around simplifying the environment in total, about going into managing the costs and keeping the affordability of these programs more relevant to the marketplace and to really kind of lean to the programs that have really worked extremely well.","Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA and wherever that has played out, those markets have actually been more stable and better performing. And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country and that funding for both Medicare and Medicaid is something that we have been advocating consistency and stability of it.","Kind of those themes are what we have stayed with. I think commenting beyond that, particularly as new administrations take hold and so forth, our posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively and serving the most number of individuals and making that system simpler and more usable for everybody. So I think beyond commenting on that level, I don't think we are going to get into what's going to happen going forward on either a state basis or federal. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold","A couple has been asked. On Medicaid, what are you seeing in terms of the rate outlook and the margin outlook there? I know some of the expansion states are coming through with some pretty hefty rate cuts. You continue to gain business so even though you've improved margins on the businesses new to you, so how do we think about that? And then with respect to OptumRx, you won -- you're going to doing Medicare Advantage. You're going to be growing PDP; you've got these new contracts offset by minor losses of membership relative to all of that and individual so top line looks like it is going to be up a lot. But if you have to give up margin with this new business, how should we think about the Optum margin next year -- Rx, OptumRx? ","Stephen Hemsley","I thought you were going to Medicaid, so we'll start that way with Austin and then we'll finish with respect to the OptumRx. Austin? ","Austin Pittman","So there's really not a lot different in the Medicaid rating environment today than there has been over the past several years. As you know, states continue to be challenged to balance their budgets while continuing to develop new, high-quality programs to care for, as been mentioned already today, larger and larger populations and many of those populations with much more complex needs.","We are honored to play a role in helping them do that and give consistency to both the quality, delivery and the consistency in cost for their programs. We continue to see race in the low single digits, keeping pace with medical and really, you've got to look at this, pluses and minuses in line with the specific economic situation of a particular state. So again, nothing particularly different. We continue to see things come out in line with our expectations. ","Mark Thierer","So it is true that we've seen good membership growth in MA and PDP and obviously, the performance in UnitedHealthcare has been strong, as has a number of other health plan clients that we service so we're not going to get into the 2017 outlook, as we've said that will be covered in the 2017 Investor Conference coming up. I will comment though on the margin profile. I think that we're very comfortable with the current margin profile. We've talked about performing in the 3% to 5% range. We've not had to underwrite business at a deficit and we're comfortable that the business will perform at that level for the foreseeable future. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Most of the big questions have been asked, but just to clarify on some questions on Optum. When you talk about the growth in Healthcare Delivery business and the behavioral services, one on the Healthcare Delivery side, is that primarily MedExpress and can you give us a sense for how the units have trended since you've acquired it in the Spring of 2015? And then on the behavioral side, when you say expansion into new Medicaid markets, are you -- does that mean you're layering a specialty service into existing Medicaid managed care contracts or it's completely new business line out at the Medicaid level? Thanks a lot. ","Amir Dan Rubin","Chris, this is Amir Rubin. I could take both of those. So we're continuing to see a lot of growth on the OptumCare side, both on the Local Care Delivery, our Medical Practices as well as on MedExpress. MedExpress, I think you -- specifically, we now have over 180 centers in 16 states and we're planning to grow to over 200 by year-end and we're continuing to see investments into the future there on that platform which has been very successful.","In OptumCare, we're now managing approximately 20,000 physicians, serving over 8 million consumers, as I said, in almost now 51 geographic markets and so we'll continue to see growth there. We also serve through our special needs program in OptumHealth and our conference care management over 2000 specialty nursing facilities so we will continue to see growth there. On the behavioral side, we are seeing growth both at the Medicaid level and having success with wins in states as well as on the commercial side, selling more business to employers and through to health plans as well. ","Chris Rigg","But nothing that's actually structurally integrated into these new proposals and things like that. ","Amir Dan Rubin","Correct. ","Stephen Hemsley","It's basically operated on an open-market integrated basis. ","Amir Dan Rubin","Correct. ","Stephen Hemsley","So we'll take about two more questions, I think. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","It sounds like with that 80.3% on the loss ratio, your Commercial Group underwriting spread seems like it's pretty stable. You sound confident on the cost trend. Any thoughts on the trends you're seeing in the selling season on pricing as the Blue Cross Blue Shield seem to have to expand on Exchanges and maybe sustaining more losses. Is that influencing their pricing posture? And then secondly, on the self-insured side, what are the mix shifts doing and is that, in any way, impacting the price competition in fully insured? ","Stephen Hemsley","I'm not sure I can piece that question together fully. I think it's really around pricing. We're not going to comment really about others or what others might be experiencing but we can kind of give you some commentary with respect to what our pricing philosophies are. And I think we're in pretty good shape as it relates to the coming years. So, Jeff? ","Jeff Alter","I will comment on what we see in the marketplace in general and I'll just say what we see in the marketplace in general is affirming of pricing particularly in the fully insured which has helped us to grow because of our remaining -- our historical discipline in pricing continues. We always price our businesses to our view of our forward-cost trends and as you look back into our 2014 year, that -- we took some losses because of that discipline and now as those markets begin to firm again, we're growing in those marketplaces.","So I think the general tone in the marketplace right now is it remains a competitive environment and we believe that will continue through the 2017 season in small business in key accounts but most importantly, what we focus on is making sure our products add value to our clients and are priced appropriately for our forward view of cost. ","Stephen Hemsley","We're not seeing anything unusual in terms of the pricing environment. ","Jeff Alter","No. If anything, it's a pretty benign environment right now. ","Stephen Hemsley","Both on the insured and self-insured one below. ","Jeff Alter","Yes. ","Operator","We will take our final question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Sheryl Skolnick","There have been a couple of criticisms of late which I think your quarter results -- congratulations to everyone. It kind of puts it that, but I'm going to ask this question anyway, because it comes up from time to time. So obviously, it's not possible for UnitedHealthcare to win all of this business on its merits but rather, it must be under pricing and therefore, must be crushing its margin.","So in view of the fact that you didn't do that this quarter and it seems from your -- seemingly well-based enthusiasm for your momentum and the strength of your business and customer relationships that you're unlikely to crush your margins off the new business in the several coming quarters. How much of this new business win is actually related to the -- and also, the ability to preserve margins, especially within UHC is ability to the -- is attributable to the integration of all of the business units, not just in OptumCare, within OptumHealth or not just the UHC, with OptumInsight but all of it together.","So I'm asking the same question I asked basically in the third quarter of 2011 and 2012 and beyond which is how much of your results is as a result of the transformation of United itself to a better, smarter integrated business with Optum and UnitedHealthcare, nevermind the transformation of the marketplace? ","Stephen Hemsley","Well, as usual, Sheryl, your questions almost don't need answers. We are a profoundly different value proposition. We are -- we try to bring value to the marketplace through a much more diversified proposition and that each year, gets more effective, more integrated, more mature. And I think that, as Dave said in his commentary, six or seven years of steady growth in the UnitedHealthcare business, the growth across all of the platforms. It is a different proposition and I think that's -- really just sums it up. I won't go further than that. And again, we just have to prove that every quarter, in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of our growth and the consistency of our financial performance, as we continue to grow and expand the business and they are still a lot of opportunity. ","We are far from our full potential and generally, when we conclude these sessions with you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing if we performed to full potential. So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter. Expect to do it into the finish of the year. Have a positive attitude on 2017 and we're just going to keep working on that level so that, I think, it's a good way to close out the call. So we thank you for the conversation today. I think we've delivered a strong third quarter. We reported solid growth in virtually every business across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare.","We are going to leverage this forward momentum and expect to close 2016 with a real energy and drive strong and sustained performance into 2017. We will continue to elevate the quality of our service. I think that's really important for us. We are very focused on NPS and quality performance to bring that to customers and to bring it to providers, improve the healthcare experience for consumers and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Our Investor Conference in November is just a few weeks away and we have held back a number of things this morning so that we can have a robust conversation with you in November. And we look forward to that. So thank you for your participation this morning. ","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.

I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.","A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports & SEC Filings section of the company\u2019s investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 17, 2018, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company\u2019s website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.","David Wichmann","Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter report. We are encouraged by how our businesses are advancing in service to customers, consumers, physicians and across the health care system at large. Encouraged, but far from satisfied. Continuous innovation and improvement in the health care experience are critical to fulfilling our mission, helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone.","Consistency in high-quality care, consumer experience and value build trust and loyalty. These drive retention and growth and position us to deliver strong and reliable financial results in 2019, 2020, and beyond. First half 2018 performance illustrates strong execution on this path. Compared to last year\u2019s first half, revenues of $111.3 billion, increased 12.7% or $12.5 billion.","Adjusted cash flows from operations grew to $7.2 billion and adjusted net earnings grew 28.2% to $6.19 per share. For the full-year, our outlook for adjusted net earnings per share is increasing to a new range of $12.50 to $12.75 per share. And we expect cash flows from operations for 2018 to approach $15.5 billion, which is the upper end of our previous guidance.","Importantly, our enterprise-wide Net Promoter Score is tracking to advance meaningfully again in 2018, after increasing 6 points in 2017. Our NPS is particularly strong or strongly improving across our government program customers and consumers, within our care delivery businesses, with network physicians and their practice managers, and with customers and consumers at UnitedHealthcare Global and the pharmacy business at OptumRx.","NPS across the employer health benefits base remains solid, with upside opportunities to distinguish our performance among commercial market consumers. We believe emerging innovations around a next generation of digitally enabled, highly personalized services combined with more evolved consumer-centric benefit offerings will further advance our NPS performance.","Quality continues to be strong and rising. Approximately 80% of our Medicare Advantage seniors will be served by 4-star rated plans in 2019, and we are looking to improve on that strong base in 2020. For commercial benefits, we expect more than 40 local market health plans will be rated in the top HEDIS categories in 2018, up from just 10 two years ago. And we continue to help create a better future for health care through Venture investments; building new businesses organically; ongoing investments in innovation throughout our enterprise; and, open source innovation through partnerships and strategic acquisitions of businesses and capabilities.","We look forward to sharing some of these and other innovations and developments with you at our annual investor conference. As you know, we apply core competencies in clinical expertise, technology and data analytics to serve people in differentiated ways across our operating platforms, focusing on our five, long-term growth pillars. Transforming pharmacy care services is just one of those pillars. Applying our core competencies in the pharmacy arena yields a better service experience, transparency, simplicity, lower costs, higher value and growth, and we do so engaging proactively with customers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers across the industry.","UnitedHealth Group now has more than five years\u2019 experience synchronizing medical care and pharmacy care for patients. Over those five years, we have continually applied learnings to refine our approach, while hardening, scaling and expanding our services. Results in market share and NPS gains suggest we are the clear market leader in capability, experience and value. We deliver integrated pharmacy care services to employers and health plans on both a carve-in and a carve-out basis.","Health plans and employers continue to award OptumRx new business, while existing customers are retained at a high 90s percentage rate, year-after-year. Here\u2019s how this integration of pharmacy and medical care actually works. Optum\u2019s analytics engine processes administrative, demographic, clinical, lab, pharmacy and behavioral data to produce specific next best action information at the individual consumer level and identify the highest value actions an individual is most likely to take. That likelihood is a critical element because an action not taken produces no value.","We then deliver the insight to patients, consumers, and physicians on a multi-channel basis. Perhaps they need help adhering to a medication regimen, or digital coaching to better manage a chronic condition, or they would benefit from our digital weight loss and diabetes prevention program. This year our customer advocates will help people, in real time, schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors\u2019 appointments to close specific gaps in care. Together, these services are helping client\u2019s advance quality, lower costs and improve consumer satisfaction. This integrated approach improves pharmacy adherence by 12%, while helping reduce hospital admissions and ER use by 6%.","Our digital PreCheck MyScript service offers clarity, transparency and simplicity to the prescribing physician through their electronic medical record, while helping patients at the point of care. Already today, PreCheck MyScript is integrated into the practice flow of physicians who treat as many as 5 million OptumRx consumers over the next year, and we will grow that figure aggressively over the course of the next 18 months. These people will have a simpler experience at the pharmacy counter, as a direct result of the real-time pre-authorization capacities and the formulary cost and coverage information delivered to their physician by PreCheck MyScript.","OptumRx continues to emphasize timely, convenient prescription delivery for consumers. Our specialty pharmacies have long used local hubs to provide same day and next day delivery, with clinical support and counseling provided by pharmacists via modern telemedicine. We provide infusion services, delivering specialty pharmaceuticals to patients in their homes over 350,000 times annually, and we have begun to apply these services more broadly through our OptumCare sites. Patients using maintenance medicines receive refills in advance of their refill dates through our home delivery services, providing value and convenience for these prescription needs.","Finally, we are improving real consumer value, as a leader in offering transparent, point of sale discounts to consumers at the pharmacy counter. These meaningful discounts will be embedded in the basic benefit design for more than 7 million UnitedHealthcare insured consumers. We are the only party incented to reduce both the net cost of drugs for people and the total medical cost for customers, giving us a unique value role in the pharmacy supply chain.","All of these capabilities appropriately manage pharmacy and medical cost trends, ensure the highest levels of patient safety, simplify the consumer\u2019s experience and improve value. Innovation, quality, service and performance across all five growth pillars will be critical to helping us fulfill our mission and doing our part to help the markets we serve advance care access while reining in growth in health care spending.","Now, let me now turn it to Andrew Witty for an update on our Optum business. Andrew, welcome to UnitedHealth Group.","Andrew Witty","Thank you, Dave. I\u2019ll start today by expressing my admiration and appreciation toward all those whose work has created the extraordinary Optum platform, which is frankly unlike any other health care business in the world. As a member of the UnitedHealth Group Board of Directors, I had the opportunity to get to know the company and its people.","And now, as Optum\u2019s CEO, I am further impressed with the capabilities and talent we have at every level of this company and the breadth of opportunity for Optum to serve and grow in pursuit of its mission.","Optum is vibrant and performing well. This young company will continue the nimble, market-responsive approach it has embraced since its inception, enabling Optum to serve more people, in more ways, and producing consistent, strong growth in revenues and earnings.","In the second quarter 2018, OptumHealth increased the number of people it serves by 7% to 92 million, and revenue per person grew 12% over last year, as OptumCare grows and diversifies its businesses. OptumInsight\u2019s backlog grew nearly 15% year-over-year, on the strength of its technology, data analytics, business process and advisory services. And OptumRx again filled over 3% more adjusted prescriptions, as it continued to expand its market share.","Overall, Optum second quarter revenues grew by more than $2 billion over last year, growth of about 9% to nearly $25 billion. Optum\u2019s earnings from operations rose 21.5%, driven by strong revenue growth and 80 basis points of margin expansion, due to both operating advances and solid, fundamental expense disciplines. Importantly, all three Optum segments expanded margins and grew operating earnings strongly.","Now, looking ahead, the differentiated value we deliver to customers positions us to sustain growth into 2019 and beyond. Digital health is a UnitedHealth Group growth pillar, like pharmacy care services. Rally, part of Optum, has emerged as a market-leading comprehensive consumer digital health platform, fully implemented and operating at scale, with multi-payer capabilities. Rally is our digital front door for the consumer.","Rally helps people easily select the best health benefits plans for their families, assess their health, pursue wellness and, when care is needed, engage effectively with the health care system. Rally has now surpassed $1 billion in cumulative incentives paid to consumers, standing apart in an early stage digital health marketplace. Consumers earned these incentives for taking real actions to improve their health, like receiving biometric screenings, working to stop smoking, or selecting a primary care physician, to just name three of many.","By moving to digital coaching from legacy telephonic models, Rally triples the number of individuals engaging in our programs, while creating much higher consumer engagement intensity and loyalty. As a result, our customers are avoiding millions of dollars in downstream medical costs. Already one-third of our wellness coaching customers have moved to this new approach and more than 90% of their coaching engagements are digital, compared to an entirely analog experience only one year ago.","OptumInsight continues to grow steadily, working actively with payer customers, large and small, supporting their efforts to maintain and improve clinical quality, administrative accuracy and payment integrity. Our artificial intelligence capabilities in areas like natural language processing for clinical information are embedded in our product sets and have proven valuable to both payers and care providers. Today, care providers who deliver care to nearly one-third of all Americans use Optum Performance Analytics, deepening and enriching the clinical data sets we use to improve performance of health care systems and the","health of people.","At OptumCare, we are creating the structure to advance more modern and locally effective clinical and administrative models, for the benefit of physicians, patients and customers. OptumCare actively advances the practice of evidence-based medicine and meaningfully improves consistency in care quality, while sustaining NPS scores in the range of 80 and offering more convenient sites of service for applicable procedures and examinations at more than 500 community locations nationally.","Savings are more than 50% compared to less effective sites of care. This business is early in its growth curve, and, like digital health, we see it is another important long-term growth pillar for the enterprise.","Finally, as you heard Dave say, the value being delivered in pharmacy care services is translating into higher NPS and continued client retention rates in the high 90s at OptumRx, and new wins, including three new health plans for 2019. We are already hard at work with prospects for 2020, even as we further strengthen capabilities for 2019.","In sum, our businesses are growing and performing well today and preparing for next year, and we believe our investments in people, technologies and processes position us to grow for years to come. I am energized by the potential Optum has to make a meaningful difference in health care.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO.","Steve Nelson","Thank you, Andrew, and welcome. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 2.2 million more people over the past 12 months. All-in, our revenues advanced more than $5 billion over last year to nearly $46 billion in the quarter, growing at a 12% pace, with Medicare & Retirement revenues growing nearly 13% and Community & State by more than 17%. Our commercial business continues to serve nearly 27 million people, with steady growth of 50,000 people in risk-based offerings this quarter, while the public and senior sector grew to serve 60,000 more people.","We also experienced minor attrition in our fee-based products in the second quarter, similar to the second quarter of last year. The pricing we are receiving for risk-based products remains consistent with our expectations, and commercial medical cost trends remain steady, also in-line with expectations. And, we\u2019re performing well on managing administrative costs across UnitedHealthcare. In total, our second quarter earnings from operations of $2.4 billion","grew 7% over second quarter last year.","Looking forward, we are progressing well on two more enterprise growth pillars; consumer-centric benefits, and global. As we improve our total cost of care position and simplify the consumer experience. In consumer-centric benefits, we continue to align our approaches with value-based care delivery, supported by modern digital resources and data-empowered human and digital advocates, who help people navigate the system and achieve their health and care objectives. This modern, integrated approach increasingly enables greater personalization, better information flow and improved consumer experience and value, as measured by NPS.","For example, in our Medicare products, value-based care is driving 5% increases in key screenings, a 13% lower rate of emergency room use and a 3% increase in the number of seniors with regular doctor visits. All of which ultimately impact cost, satisfaction, consumer retention and growth for our business. It\u2019s all about helping people at the moment they need it, and then making it as simple as possible for them to make the best decisions to improve the effectiveness and quality of their care, affordability and overall satisfaction. These themes hold true, whether the person making that decision is a patient with a medical issue, a healthy consumer focused on prevention, a physician treating a patient, or a business executive understanding value drivers in their health benefit offerings.","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to see strong growth in serving those with higher acuity needs, like seniors, dual special needs, long-term support services and the chronically ill. UnitedHealthcare Global just completed the first full-quarter with Banmedica, which is growing and performing well, serving the people of Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Strong year-over-year improvements in business performance were made in Brazil, as focused efforts over the past half-decade have strengthened Brazilian clinical integration and business alignment.","These efforts have been instrumental in improving earnings in that region and will continue to gain momentum going forward. Amil\u2019s recent recognition as the most innovative health insurance company in Brazil was informed by advances in technology, consumer experience and product design, and investments in primary care delivery and new models for paying for care. Our young South American business is well positioned, with strong assets, a stabilizing business environment and a long runway for growth.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","John Rex","Thank you, Steve. The well-balanced quarter we reported this morning includes consolidated revenues growing 12% over last year to more than $56 billion. Our earnings from operations exceeded $4.2 billion, growing nearly 13%, on steady operating margins. Adjusted earnings increased 28% to $3.14 per share, and our cash flow from operations grew to $4 billion. ","Turning to details, we continue to expect our 2018 medical care ratio to run in the range of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points, with commercial trend well within our range of expectations of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. In the quarter, our consolidated care ratio of 81.9% reflects the impact of the health insurance tax, offset by changes in business mix and reserve development, both compared to last year. This quarter\u2019s favorable development was principally due to favorable cost true-ups from the first quarter 2018 business.","Our second quarter operating cost ratio of 15% increased only 40 basis points over last year, despite including about 1 percentage point cost increase from the return of the health insurance tax and higher investments in innovation and business development. We offset that pressure with strong revenue growth in lower operating cost ratio businesses like Medicare and Medicaid and operating expense discipline across the board.","Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to maintain distinctive strength and flexibility. Return on equity for the second quarter exceeded 24%, and our debt to total capital ratio was 40.8% at June 30. In June, the board of directors raised our shareholder dividend by 20% to an annual rate of $3.60 per share, and we continue to deploy capital to further diversify our company through focused merger and acquisition activities and for our longstanding share repurchase program.","We are optimistic as we look ahead to the second half of 2018 and into 2019, and strive for continued performance improvement, while taking a realistic and prudent view of the future. As Dave mentioned, we now expect 2018 cash flows from operations to approach $15.5 billion, and adjusted earnings in the range of $12.50 to $12.75 per share, growth of 24% to nearly 27%.","David Wichmann ","Thank you, John. We think about the numbers shared with you today as the result of serving millions of people, one person at a time, one health system at a time. We continue to advance value, simplicity, affordability and quality. Doing so in differentiated ways increases our value and sustains our growth. Growth provides even more opportunities to fulfill our mission and deliver long-term performance for the people we serve and our shareholders.","As we pass the midpoint of this year, we begin to shift focus to the year ahead when we expect our enterprise to continue to innovate, grow and perform strongly for society and for our investors. We expect to grow revenues, earnings and cash flows broadly across the expanse of our uniquely diversified and increasingly global health care portfolio. We won\u2019t get into specifics now, but at this distance we see more tailwinds than headwinds.","As was the case heading into 2018, the tailwinds in our businesses are largely generated internally, coming from strong and diversified growth across our five distinct pillars, all aimed at achieving our longstanding mission. To achieve this growth, our businesses will continue to make deeper investments in quality improvements, technology deployment, delivery system optimization, consumer-centric financing mechanisms and other innovations to improve the value individuals receive from the health system. These investments will also serve to lower our cost structures, improve NPS and enable sustained growth and differentiated value for years to come.","As to headwinds, we expect the policy debates surrounding coverage expansions and health care costs to continue into next year. Additionally, the return of the health insurance tax in 2020 will cause higher premiums and lower coverage levels for people, and we will be advocating on behalf of our customers and consumers for a delay or outright repeal of this tax.","As solid as our performance may seem, we are not satisfied, given our organization\u2019s capabilities and capacities to serve. Despite strong top-line growth and results, we are not performing at, nor consistently growing to, our full potential. This has, and will continue to be, an area of intense focus for our business leaders. ","Perhaps even more critical from my perspective, we must work enterprise-wide to improve our speed and agility, so the pace of innovation and change better reflect our restless drive to deliver even more value to those we serve and unleash the full transformative impact of this enterprise.","We will provide some initial direction on 2019 in our third quarter earnings call, followed by a full review at our annual Investor Conference on Tuesday, November 27. We hope you can join us there. Now we will open the call for your questions. One question per caller please so we can get to as many as people as possible.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. My questions are on reserve development. Given the relative lack of prior and intra-year development in the quarter, I was hoping you could give us some increased color on cost trend and reserve development across the commercial Medicaid and Medicare segments. And then just to make sure we understand prior year development trends overall can you tell us what percentage of claims if any you have you set each quarter for adverse deviation to your reserves, I think most companies talk about mid-single digits, but just wanted to confirm yours. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Okay, there is Jeff Putnam.","Jeff Putnam","Good morning. Thanks for your question Justin. Starting with development, we maintain our reserving process as you know that\u2019s tightly controlled and consistent over time, and we're very comfortable with our reserve position at the end of the quarter and really pleased with the overall accuracy of our reserve-in over time. When you look at our year-to-date development because second quarter was fairly modest, but when you look year-to-date as a percentage of our medical, prior year medical experience it is right in-line where we are historically.","As that works into trends, we are always very respectful of trends, but as we stand right now we\u2019ve not seen anything to date that would inform or change our view on commercial medical trends for the year by cost category or in total, and we don't get into details on trends in Medicare and Medicaid businesses, but I could offer a couple of comments.","Medicare trends generally stable with the last year and we are seeing some elevated consumption over time, similar to last year related to the market leading growth that we\u2019ve had and Medicaid trends also really need to be looked at state-by-state as always there are some areas with increased trend and then we are working to manage those down, but nothing really notable to call out on those.","Justin Lake","The Medicare trend you mentioned, can you just expand on that like what would drive that in terms of your market leading growth? I apologize.","Jeff Putnam","Maybe, I could ask Brian Thompson to speak to that.","Brian Thompson","Sure. Hi, Justin. Brian Thompson here. Again, we're really not seeing any trend of the emergence in 2018, I want to make that clear. What we're seeing is very consistent with what we saw in 2017. I think the point is, given our market leading growth, we do prepare for and have seen a utilization uptick as we grow meaningfully compared to the rest of the market. We see that both in the form of new enrollees, as well as our improved retention and are holding onto folks later in life. So again, what we're seeing in 2018 looks a lot like what we saw in 2017 and 2016 that\u2019s been the 4Q and now for strong market share gains and provides a very credible good baseline for us as we look forward to 2019.","Justin Lake","Thank you.","David Wichmann","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sarah James","Thank you. My question is on the 2019 commercial environment. On the last call, you had mentioned the national account RFP pipeline is larger than normal. Is that \u2026","David Wichmann","Sarah, we are having a hard time hearing you, so can you \u2013 you may be on a headset or something, can you\u2026","Sarah James","Sorry, is that better?","David Wichmann","Yes, it is, thank you.","Sarah James","So, my question is on the 2019 commercial pricing, on the last call you mentioned that the national account RFP pipeline was larger than normal, there have been some concerns as I believe which I think pricing, so, could you walk us through how you are seeing national account small and middle market develop?","David Wichmann","Sure. I think the question relates to national accounts pipeline and development team.","Dan Schumacher","Sure, thanks Sarah good morning. So, on the national accounts front, as we continue to progress through the selling season, I think I shared last quarter and would likewise amplify this quarter is that it is really a theme around incumbency that continues to be as we progress to the selling season. At this point, I would tell you that we\u2019ve had some nice new client wins, as well as expansions in existing clients, but we\u2019ve also had some client leave us as well, and obviously there is still more to be resolved in the selling season.","We are doing well again to convert retirees to group Medicare offerings and likewise we continue to do very well in the middle market segment as we work through the year. So, that is sort of the self-funded national account profile. I think you also were asking a bit about the pricing environment and as it relates to commercial risk-based offerings. And from our perspective, we are happy to see as we had told you last quarter, we would expect to return to growth in the commercial risk-based group offerings as we progress through the year. We did that in the second quarter and had nice contributions across all market segments from individuals, small groups through to middle market as well.","So, as we look at that environment it is competitive, it has been competitive. We always have pockets of competition that we\u2019re responding to, but we find ourselves well positioned and well served by our broad footprint both geographically, as well as by market segment and funding status. As we talked about in this form for some time, we\u2019ve done well to expand our product portfolio really along that value and price continuum and increasingly aligned that to get providers that are high performing. So, hopefully that gave you some color on what is happening both in the self-funded and the fully insured segments in the commercial markets.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Sarah. Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dave Windley","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to flip over to Optum, the kind of two-part are here, so the first part, OptumInsight margin has performed very well year-to-date, wondered if you could talk about either pricing or mix of business drivers of that? And then secondly and more broadly as Andrew talked about Rally and the uptake of different technologies, how do you think about broadening the uptake or the adoption rate of your technologies in an environment where we might see competition directly from a technology company?","David Wichmann","Okay. We will take both those questions. Tim you want to take the first one?","Tim Wicks","Sure. Happy to do that. Dave thank you very much for the question. So, on OptumInsight, as we think about the quarter and we think about the margin growth it really is two items. One, you referenced pricing and mix and there is a significant amount of mix opportunity that is occurring in terms of growth of business around the risk and quality businesses, as well as payment integrity, and then the second area that is also important and continues to be important, you heard us talk a significant amount in 2017 about the discipline that we drove financial discipline and overall cost management, and that\u2019s really coming through the business. Frankly, all across Optum, but specifically an OptumInsight in the quarter as well.","David Wichmann","Great. And then if I can I will just make a few remarks on Rally as well. Thank you for the question. Rally as you can tell in the script is something that we're very proud of having developed over the course of last four years. Obviously, there was a lot of work that went into in advance of our alignment with them, but they\u2019ve done a very nice job of taking a single product company and making it multidimensional along the lines that Andrew has described. So, we are seeing probably the very fast uptake and in fact accelerating uptake of that business as we expand our offerings to respond to greater levels of consumer need.","So as an example, when we gave Rally the responsibility for our premium designation program, which is effectively the way in which consumers search for and find a physician and\/or other care services we gave that responsibility we also started to appeal to a broader group of consumers, which dramatically increase the registration rate across that platform now sitting at I believe somewhere around 18 million people are registered with Rally today. ","So, we believe that the expansion of the value that is offered on the Rally chassis is the single best way to get there and that really requires that we continue to provide a significant value to consumers both in terms of cost containment, but also in terms of the improved health that they each received. So, we\u2019re continuing to expand and diversify that offering keeping it simple for people and we look forward to the developments that we will see with the individual health record and how that drives next best action and to the consumers that we serve and expect to see increased utilization as a result as well.","Dave Windley","Thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you, David. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Good morning. Thank you. My first question is regarding Optum. Andrew welcome aboard in your first quarter in the hot seat, and I kind of want to understand what you expect to be different about growing Optum going forward under you relative to how it\u2019s grown in the past? And then if you could in the quarter itself the growth in revenues at Optum slowed down from the first quarter, can you spike out how much of that was related to M&A?","Andrew Witty","Sure. Peter thanks very much for the question. I\u2019ll ask Tim in a second to address your second part of the question, but in terms of the first, obviously very early days for me here at Optum, I them terrific foundations have been laid over the last seven or eight years in terms of the asset base of this company has is rarely, I think unparallel in terms of the portfolio of assets that we have. As we look forward, I think the opportunity is going to be very much centered around how we start to drive the gearing between all of these assets to really bring to life the full potential of this portfolio.","And I think what we see, a very high level is significant at direct local interface as care provider and touch points with patients and consumers. So, a business with a real face backed up with an extraordinary evolving digital capability, which then allows us to drive high frequency contact really all underpinned by tremendous commitment to care and delivering quality of care, commitment to bringing down total cost of care and ensuring all of that is done in an extraordinary high-quality way.","So, I think all of those tenants of the business, which have got us thus far are going to be absolutely the characteristics going forward. What I\u2019m focusing on now of course is really making sure I understand all of the various parts of this business, working with the team to figure out the next steps, but it is going to, I think be characterized very much in the way I just described. Maybe, I could pass to Tim to answer the more specific question on the quarter.","Tim Wicks","Sure. Peter, thank you for the question. First, what I would say is, as we look at the growth rate of revenue at Optum both year-over-year and sequentially it is in-line with our plans in both of those ways of looking at it. The revenues of 24.7 billion were up 9% or up 2.1 billion, compared to a year ago with both OptumHealth and OptumInsight posting double-digit growth rates and with OptumRx posting a 7% growth rate year-over-year. ","In each of those businesses, organic growth was very strong, both in OptumHealth, in terms of care delivery with market expansion, as well as OptumServe volume growth and then behavioral health and then in OptumInsight, strong growth with the addition of the advisory board, but also pretty significant volume growth in terms of our risk and quality business and then also volume growth and payment integrity.","Also, when I mentioned OptumRx earlier in the overall revenue growth there, I think it is important to understand that that\u2019s driven by new sales growth in terms of new clients that have come on, as well as very strong expansion in terms of specialty as well. So, really solid growth across the businesses and in-line with our expectations.","Peter Costa","I was hoping you would spike out quantitatively exactly what the growth was from M&A this quarter versus the growth last quarter.","Tim Wicks","We don't spike that out specifically Peter, but I would tell you it\u2019s not an appreciable difference.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","David Wichmann","Okay, thank you Peter. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow up on sort of the decline in ASO, coupled with another strong quarter of growth in the group risk business. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing out there, has that sort of decades long shift ASO stalled or slowed or are you seeing greater demand for group risk products now and if so, why do you think that is? And just in this context, if you could comment on Nexus ACO, I'd be really curious to hear what\u2019s happening there? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Sure, thanks Steve. This is Dan Schumacher. You had a few things tucked in there, but first just on the quarter and the decline with regard to self-funded enrolment. In reality, there is, it is just sort of the normal seasonal pattern, particularly in our international accounts and quarter-based attrition. So, if you look at that outcome it compares into the average of the last 5 or 10 years it is very much in keeping with that. ","So, really just the normal seasonal pattern we see on the ASO front. I think you had asked about is there an acceleration or a change in the trend in the migration from fully integrated to self-funded. That continues to be a recurring theme I would say, it's sort of add a comparable pace to what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. ","So, I wouldn't spike out any acceleration or deceleration in that. We don't believe on the fully insured side to see greater take-up rights, what we\u2019re doing there is we are actually taking market share, and I think that large contributor to that is really the work that we\u2019ve done as I had mentioned before around expanding our product portfolio around that value of continuum and then making sure importantly we pair it with really high performing care delivery partners both OptumCare, as well as externally, and then improving as we have talked about the consumer experience and making it simple and personal for them.","You had asked I think also about Nexus ACO. We continue to build that product and are excited for the prospects and just as a reminder for those on the phone that Nexus ACO offering is really a national accountable care offering. So, we string together our best solutions locally onto a national solution. Today we've got about 75,000 enrollees on that. We\u2019ll double that as we turn into the year and we look to double that again by the time we get to the end of 2019. Thanks Steve.","David Wichmann","So, really Steve what you\u2019ve hit on is this category of growth for us, pillar of growth around consumer centric benefits, and Nexus ACO would be one example, but if you look to the distinguished group insured growth over the course of the last three years or so, and why we are bullish on growth going forward it\u2019s really because of these new designs that were progressively putting in the marketplace and may be tied to the question to before that. Our ability than to use digital assets and other ways to engage consumer around lifestyle behavior modifications creates a great attraction to these products as well. Thank you for your question. Next question please.","Operator","Thanks. We will go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Baker","Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could outline some of your promising venture investments in-light of your drive to reshape the future health care.","David Wichmann","We\u2019ll start with David Wichmann.","David Wichmann","Yes sure. So, Optum Ventures they generally invest in visual health companies that use data and analytics to improve consumers access to help the healthcare services and health care across the board. Also, Ventures really invest in things that make the health care system more reliable and easier to navigate. The Ventures investments are focused on I would say four main areas, health analytics, digital on-demand, consumer focused health, and healthcare system management. I would also say and conclude that there is lot of synergies between Optum and Optum Ventures, Optum providing a good scalable platform to test Optum Ventures and Optum Ventures is being able to sort of give us some shots in the arm with respect toward Digital agenda.","Michael Baker","Thanks [indiscernible].","David Wichmann","I would just add a little bit to that if I can. We also build businesses organically as well inside our company and maybe just comment on a couple. One would be a business [indiscernible] we are advancing new platforms for dialysis really trying to promote home-based dialysis and use, as well as trying to drive greater value to consumers in that whole category if you will. And then at this time, I would also mention when we announced this in the last couple of weeks where we created a company called, along with our venture partner alumni, created a company called [indiscernible], which is an on-demand healthcare insurance platform, which I would characterize as being pretty revolutionary in terms of the potential that holds to fit a particular market segment in the group insured marketplace, as well as self-funded market as well. So, those are a couple of additional examples. These are the things that we hope to profile for you to a greater extent when we get together in November. Next question please.","Operator","Next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I want to ask you about the guidance because I struggled a little bit with the guidance that\u2019s happened so far year-to-date because Q1 you raised guidance by less than a beat in Q2, you basically raised guidance with the beat, even though announcing a few pretty big deals during the year, Banmedica, Sound, a few other things that are probably at least a third of what the full guidance range has been. So, I wanted to see if you could kind of rectify why, you know the guidance hasn't been raised by more given the tailwinds from M&A and then given a fairly pretty solid trend so far in the first half of the year? Is there anything you would highlight as you know one-time in the first half or a headwind coming in the second half?","David Wichmann","Thanks Kevin. I think we\u2019ve actually raised expectations pretty strongly over the course of this year. So, twice by total of about $0.175 [ph] at the midpoint and that\u2019s despite some pretty substantive flu pressure and a new HIPAA effect that we\u2019ve identified in the first quarter of around $0.22 or so. So, the way we look at it at least from my vantage point we\u2019ve raised it by about $0.40 or so, so far this year.","So, but I think importantly as we look to the balance of 2018 we\u2019re focused on growth, we\u2019re continuing to focus on cost containment and achieving the full potential this enterprise capacity is, and you could see that we are deeply investing in innovation to drive constructive measured change and improve healthcare economics in both North and South America.","So, we are also focused on these five areas of growth advancing quality, driving MPS or measured by MPS I should say, and again continuing to invest and diversify our businesses so that we can achieve a long-term sustainable growth rate that we have outlined for you in the past of which we remain deeply committed to as well. We did buy Medicare in the first quarter that Medicare is interesting for us, right now it is in winter. So, not particularly accretive in the second and third quarter of the year, it happens to bare the same characteristics as the UnitedHealthcare Brazil businesses as well.","So, we don't see a lot of material improvements in our results as it relates to that and they will start to see that closer to the fourth quarter or so. But part of what I laid out as well is that and maybe this is what you\u2019re suspecting is that the company has so much potential given its assets and just performing to its full potential is our ambition and that is what this team is aiming to achieve. So, we will continue to get after cost, we are going to continue to get after growth, and diversifying and growing our business and importantly investing in it for the long term. So, we can serve more people and so more health systems better. Thanks, good for your question. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes, good morning. I had a couple of questions or question on the PVM in particular, I was invested in understanding for margin in OptumRx, looks like margin was up for the quarter although cost of product was also up, so I was just interested in some of the drivers of that and then I guess related to the long-term view there, how are you looking at the online pharmacy strategy of United overall and with an entrant like Pillpack and Amazon, what's your view as far as adding them in network, partnering with them et cetera? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Great question Lance. Appreciate it. John Prince, do you want to take that?","John Prince","Sure. Lance, John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. Thanks for the question. Maybe just talk about the margin in general. We are comfortable with our long-term outlook of 3% to 5%. I think when we see in different quarters, you see a variation with mix over time. The product is really driver of our specialty home-infusion and those really drive our business in terms of the product mix and so I think it will fluctuate over time, but ultimately, we're comfortable with our long-term outlook and also comfortable with how we\u2019re executing on the market from an overall perspective.","In terms of online pharmacy, we work with various partners across the healthcare system. We have been very focused on our consumer experience in our home delivery, our specialty and our infusion business, that has been the key driver of our growth over the last year and a half. We have done exceptionally the job of improving our MPS in those areas. We have become hyper-local. ","Those businesses where we are in the market and so if you look at our strategy, we retain home delivery specialty in fusion, wherein a 35 mark has been hyper-local we\u2019ve added six this year, we are going to add six more this year. We see the market relates pivoting to be in both same day and next day service. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in that, and I think we\u2019re flexible based on how consumer wants to work with us in terms of whether they want to be online digital in the market etcetera. And I think we\u2019ve got a good strategy to execute against that. Thanks for the question.","David Wichmann","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. So, I thought at this point maybe just to ask about the comment you made towards the end Dave in your prepared remarks where you talked about restless drive, I think the comment was not satisfied with the performance of few areas where we could better and then I think also maximizing performance consistently. I mean, you\u2019ve done 28% EPS growth in the first half, pretty good by most standards for this industry, what are the areas where you think you are still underperforming and what are you sort of referring to with those comments?","David Wichmann","Thanks for the question A.J. Appreciate it. I think we have highlighted some of those today. We didn't really talk about in terms of levels of disappointment, but I think it is fair to say that we are not particularly pleased with how we have done the large case ASO marketplace overall. If you look at our performance over the course of the past years and it is not reflective of the winning capabilities of this company, and so that is a good example of a place that I think we need to improve. Very satisfied with our MPS performance, but extremely anxious to get that moved up and at the same time manage the interchange of that with the evolutions that are required in order to respond to consumer demands.","So, figuring that out is one of our challenges and I\u2019d say maybe another one is just the pace at which we are driving adoption of the use of technology and digital broadly and by most measures there is nothing wrong here. I don't want to leave you with that point-of-view, but by most measures with the company of that capacity that this one has, I just believe we should be able to move faster with greater speed and agility to respond to emerging market demand for these kinds of services.","We are well up front with all of them, but my view is we need to get these into the hands of the consumers faster and make a bigger difference on how the effectiveness of health systems and the health of people. And so maybe just call, chuck it up a little bit to having maybe higher expectations than what we\u2019re currently achieving, largely because we have a good inside view of what the internal capacities are of this enterprise overall. So, expect this to step it up.","A.J. Rice","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","David Wichmann","Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask on two specific growth opportunities in 2019, the first around Medicare Advantage. And now that you guys have submitted your bids, I'm just curious there's a thought around relatively generous reimbursement, especially relative to what we've seen over the last decade or so and how you think about the Medicare Advantage market overall and then United within that. And then the second area, just public exchanges, individual public exchanges, curious if you guys are getting more interested or I guess that would be any interested in potential expansions there and how you're thinking about that market over the next couple of years?","David Wichmann","Thank you, Josh. Brian Thompson will take your first question.","A - Brian Thompson","Thanks, Josh. Brian Thompson here. As I mentioned last quarter, certainly encouraged by the direction of the 2019 rate, it's up nearly three points versus last year and then you complement that with some policy changes around the framework that provides greater flexibility around how we can define benefits all good for seniors. As you mentioned, I do think that ushers in an opportunity in 2019 for an environment that will provide stronger coverages and innovations and benefit enhancements for the senior serve [ph]. So, should be great for MA. As I think about our position in it, we will approach 2019 with an expectation of continuing the momentum that we've demonstrated over the last four years with share gains in 2019 as well. ","David Wichmann","And as it relates to exchanges, maybe I'll just take that one. I think Josh as we've said in the past, first of all our decisions are made state by state and as you know we have a very modest presence overall. I want to kind of reaffirm that nothing has fundamentally changed since we made our decision several years back now, which has absolutely turned out to be the right one for us.","And as always, we'll evaluate for future participation on a market-by-market basis. One thing you may read is, that there was some noise out there about us joining the Massachusetts Exchange. I just want you to know that that was largely due to our small group penetration having grown to a point where we were required to participate in that exchange. So, it wasn't necessarily a voluntary decision on our part. Thanks for the question. Next questions please.","Operator","We will go next to Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Jacoby","Thanks, good morning. Just want to go back to MLR, moved higher than we expected, obviously lots of moving parts. Can you maybe just talk about whether you've seen a bit of an uptick in maybe cost per claim or acuity? And it would be helpful to break out the 6% trend between what you're seeing in terms of utilization versus unit cost and then the last piece, just if you can give us a sense of how much then Medicare and seasonality there may be impacted MLR in the quarter? Thanks.","Tim Wicks","Thank you, Ralph. Quite a few questions inside that Ralph, but thanks for the questions. First on MLR, just to say that, that was right in-line with our expectations and as we noted earlier, there is - we're not changing our outlook for the full-year at all and the year-over-year change is an element that we described, the insurers' tax impact is favorable and then business mix and the less favorable development go on the other direction. As far as acuity, we would - overall acuity in aggregate is in-line with our expectations out there as well.","What you'll see over time though as we work hard to keep moving lower acuity in each category to its appropriate place of service that what remains in each category will naturally have a little bit upward pressure on acuity inside those categories. No change in our view on unit cost versus utilization, still it's 4% primary driver being the unit cost and 2% of utilization. And then I think the last piece was Banmedica, I think Dave touched a little bit on that earlier from given the size of Banmedica against our total medical expense base, it's really not a material factor at this point.","David Wichmann","So, you should conclude from this that the trends are very much in-line with our expectations for the year. Our teams are performing very well containing health care costs and they are pricing to a forward view of trends, very consistent with the actions that we've taken in the past. You should also take it as it relates to our last comment around international, that our international businesses in South America are performing very well, very nice growth year-over-year, offer strong baselines, good start for Banmedica as well. Next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. Just a quick two-parter. Any specific comment on days claims payable being down just to touch and then the second point is, we've kind of tiptoed around to talking about trends and I've heard and appreciate all your comments, but I just wanted to specifically ask on hospital trend given the flow of profit hospitals saw such a marked acceleration of same-store revenue in the first quarter, it's with a little more visibility at this point is, if you have seen in fact just on the hospital piece, any pickup in that trend?","Tim Wicks","Gary, I think I'll take that last one first and that we really have it when things are really aligned and consistent with what our expectations were coming into the year, and as we move throughout the year as well. The first part of your question with respect to the days, Jeff, do you want to take that?","Jeff Alter","Sure. Just to start by, as we mentioned, we're comfortable with our level of reserves here as of June 30, and it's 48.3 days, that's well within our expected range that you've seen us historically, which is typically been 47 days to 49 days other than the period where we had the individual ACA effects that elevated it up to closer to 50. And it's down year-over-year about a day when you bring it out to the decimal point there and there's a couple of things contributing to that. One is, we continue to see \u2013 we've talked about this earlier, a little modest reduction in provider claim submission timing, and also there was a timing impact from when we released capitated payments that are directly linked to risk and value revenue receipts that just changed from third quarter to second quarter relative to last year.","David Wichmann","Great. Thank you, Gary. Next question please. ","Operator","And we will go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question and good morning everybody. This is a little bit granular, but we are getting a few calls around the new expansion in 2018 of total knee replacement from just the in-patient to now the outpatient setting. So, I think at a high level, I mean there should be some cost savings around this, but there also could be an increase in utilization just because of the availability now in the lower cost setting. I'm just curious at high level what you're seeing around this phenomenon so far this year? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Maybe Andrew Hayek, who came to us from SCA can respond. ","Andrew Hayek","Thanks Steve for the question. I'll offer some general commentary. I do think the CMS policy announcement is consistent with our overall view that more surgery, including higher acuity surgery will shift to the outpatient setting and alter the surgery center setting, and that's based on improvements in technology and surgical technique and aesthetic technique and all of that improves the quality experience of cost to care. So, from an SCA standpoint, we have been seeing a continued growth in total joint replacement procedures in commercial space. We are beginning to see that happen with needs from a Medicare standpoint, in terms of physicians preparing to shift those cases.","We know it\u2019s really good for the patient in terms of quality and experience, very high NPS, fantastic quality outcomes, and then substantial cost savings. We've been seeing that on a commercial basis for a number of years and working very collaboratively with even health plans and we think that will be a great benefit to Medicare over the coming years. And we expect them to continue to widen the range of procedures that are eligible for our patient. So, all the right thing to the patient and for the health care system.","David Wichmann","Which is one of the reasons why we invested in SCA, which we viewed as the right ambulatory surgical platform properly positioned in the higher acuity surgeries that were offered in those settings, and to have great ambition for its ability to expand and need to meet some more people with higher quality and greater levels of consumer satisfaction. Just as a reminder, SCA operates in 91 NPS zone. So, very progressive and doing so while saving consumers about 50%. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Good. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. The question is on drug pricing reform and if you have any change in your plans or actions to aid the administration's agenda on overall spending specialty RX, transparency and out of pocket for seniors. You have the largest set of capabilities at scale with Medicare Advantage, bundled with Part D, the largest \u2013 big three integrated PBM and BFRX [ph], I was just curious? ","John Prince","Thanks Ana, it is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. In terms of overall drug pricing, we are very focused on lowering drug cost for consumers. And as you know Ana, our strategy is focused on where in that cost of drugs, decrease in total cost to healthcare and really creating a transformative consumer experience. And that is very aligned with what is happening in the broader market. So, in terms of what we're focused on, we're very focused on initiatives that bring down the list price of drugs, but more importantly, the net cost of drugs. So, a lot of things that we even focused on are providing out ideas around what we're doing exactly.","So, as you know, in the second quarter beginning \u2013 in the late first quarter, we started drug-to-consumer pharmacy discounts at healthcare that impacts 7 million people, I think David talked about it in his script. That impacts people from all effective cost. We've been very focused on investments and please check my script. That now is being used by almost 100,000 physicians in the market that directly links into the electronic medical record that is helping in transparency, it gives the doctor an idea of what is on formulary, how does that cost, is there lower cost alternatives. We are very focused on value payments, we are heavily focused on \u2013 we got 15 of those in the market right now and continue to expand that.","And lastly, we're very focused on our drug negotiations and encouraging our pharmaceutical partners to lower the list price. And so, we've been working with people as they come to market with products to have a lower list price and when people have done that, we've put them preferred on the formulary. So, it gives you a series of examples that we're very focused on reducing our cost, improving total cost to care and we've been doing very practical things in the market to make that a reality.","Ana Gupte","Thanks, John.","David Wichmann","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to next to David MacDonald with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","David MacDonald","Good morning. Thank you. Just one quick question on Global. I was wondering if you guys could spend a minute on what you're trying to do at the local level to increase the penetration of private insurance and also what you're doing more at the national level to try and drive increased public private collaboration with these governments? Thanks. ","David Wichmann","Great. We'll have Molly Joseph, our Chief Executive of UnitedHealthcare Global respond. ","Molly Joseph ","Sure. So, our focus is around our Latin America platform and there we really see a very strong demand for access to private healthcare and a limited supply of affordable private health care. And our core capabilities create tremendous value across affordability, access and outcomes for those that we serve. Our businesses in these markets are broad, they are diversified and they are scaled. And that is both from the health benefit perspective and from a medical delivery perspective. And we work to use these platforms in combination with our enterprise core capabilities, to advance healthcare modernization, make care more affordable and make it more effective for those that we serve. In doing that, we open up access to serve broader segments of the private healthcare market and over time, we earn trust to serve these markets more holistically by partnering with government. ","David Wichmann","I think one of the strongest examples of that is our public private partnership in our hospital in Portugal as an example, where we're leading on quality and provide a very cost-effective solution working with government to serve the needs of the people of Portugal. And Molly and her team has really done a nice job and particularly you saw on the script around innovation and bringing new innovations to the market.","What you're starting to feel is the introduction of information analytics, use of digital capacities, increased product modernization and designs in countries that have historically not had a great deal of diversity of offering. So that helps to create demand for all folks and you have access to private health systems and serves the needs of multiple different price point expectations that those consumers have. So, we're very pleased with the work that they've done. Next question please. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Thank you. If I could just \u2013 sorry this is on a very technical near-term data point, but maybe in response to the first question that you had in the Q&A session here on the reserving, I guess what I'm just trying to understand is, clearly there's a positive bias that was again this quarter to your reserve development. But is there a specific margin for adverse deviation, if that's the correct term I'm using that, that you target or is there some \u2013 or should we expect that zero is in your view the best result as we move ahead?","David Wichmann","Jeff? ","Jeff Alter","Thanks for question Matt. That's not something we disclose publicly, that said it is not zero. We do have a target and it's been very stable over the years built up by business for adverse deviation.","David Wichmann","Yes, and where that really shows itself is when you carry over from over a year. It doesn't really show up quarter-to-quarter, it shows up going from Q4 to Q1 and less dramatic when you get into Q2. Our development as indicated in the script, it really relates to Q1 this year and it's not all that different from the development that we experienced in Q2 2017, related to the first quarter of 2017 as well. Thank you, Matt. Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Mike Newshel","Thanks. I wanted to ask how much headwind from the health insurer fee moratorium you're expecting in the back half of the year from bigger commercial renewals. Dave, I think you mentioned a $0.22 impact earlier, is that right? And was any of that absorbed in the first half of the year?","David Wichmann","The $0.22, I'm sorry to confuse you, it really related to the impact of flu combined with that. I think this specifically, the hit component was what $0.06, $0.07 something in that zone, if I recall correctly, Mike. ","Mike Newshel","Got it. And then, most of that falling in the second half of the year, but small? ","David Wichmann","That's right. Yes. ","Mike Newshel","Thanks.","David Wichmann","Thank you. I believe that concludes the questions for the day. We accomplished one of our performance metrics and that was to make sure that we were able to answer all of your calls \u2013 all of your questions, excuse me. And so, I appreciate them, they were all very good. So, \u2013 but to sum up our report for the second quarter, the people of UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare executed well on our strategic path, improving quality, affordability and consumer satisfaction for the people we serve resulting in growth and reliable return for our shareholders.","Revenue, cash flow, earnings and importantly, NPS scores continue to advance. While we recognize there is much more to be done to reach the full transformative potential of our enterprise, we are committed to help positively reshape healthcare, to be higher quality, more affordable simpler and of higher value to people. We are confident that we will continue the strong performance in the second half of this year in 2019, 2020 and for many years to come. Thank you again for joining us today.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports and SEC Filings section of the company\u2019s Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 16, 2019, which may be accessed from the Investors page on the company\u2019s website.","I'll now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann. ","David Wichmann","Good morning, and thank you for joining us.","Today, we reported a strong start to 2019 with revenues up 9%, adjusted earnings per share growing 23% and return on equity of nearly 27%. Optum and UnitedHealthcare each contributed fully to this performance.","With confidence and continued momentum, we are raising our earnings expectations for 2019. The continued growth and earnings performance of our business is a byproduct of our focus on providing exceptional returns to society by improving healthcare affordability, outcomes and the patient experience, what some refer to as the triple aim.","This orientation frames our growth strategy, informs capital allocation decisions and shapes the operating plans for UnitedHealth Group's businesses, all directed towards attaining the promise of our mission. It's that same mission strategy and approach we have pursued since 1998, when UnitedHealth Group was well less than a tenth its current size and when our strength and our line capabilities and capacities did not nearly match our ambitions for the health system as they do today.","Over that 20-year time period, UnitedHealth Group has applied competencies in data, technology, clinical insights and well-formed innovation and adaptive traits to drive change and grow strong market positions in the large and fast growing healthcare end market. Our outlook for growth continues today as the pace of innovation and our capacities for change advance in a market restless for achieving improved value, access and coverage in a sensible and durable way.","The first quarter saw several developments illustrating some of the strongest progress yet on this journey, which we expect will build considerable shareholder value. In pharmacy care services OptumRx announced that point-of-sale consumer discounts on branded pharmaceuticals will be its fundamental approach to business. And UnitedHealthcare is well underway implementing point-of-sale discounts at scale for the more than eight million consumers covered through its commercial risk business.","At the counter, people are already saving about $130 per eligible script and we are prepared to participate in the CMS demo project for Part D effective January 1, 2020 to drive great \u2013 even greater pharmacy value for more people.","In digital health, our initiatives are accelerating. We completed beta testing of the individual health record physician platform and have built over five million active consumer health records. Simultaneously, our enhanced Rally consumer digital health platform now integrates digital engagement, coaching, telemedicine, and incentives with quality and advanced cost transparency and estimating capabilities.","We provide access to both proprietary and third-party services in areas such as exercise, weight, sleep, employee assistance, nutrition, and other value-based programs. In its initial 1 million member deployment this year, the enhanced Rally experienced a 13% increase in consumer engagement. We expect those numbers to further advance as the IHR and other functionality are added.","As part of our strategy to reinvent health care delivery, we apply Rally and the IHR together with OptumCare's practice capacities to advance efficacy and value. We are progressing toward the close of the DaVita Medical Group transaction and we look forward to adding more markets, more doctors, and clinical staff serving more patients.","And we continue to modernize the financing of delivery systems, whether they are owned by Optum or accessed through more modern UnitedHealthcare benefit designs across all market segments. These benefit designs will be more consumer responsive and address social determinative care, especially for those who are most affected and who have the greatest and most complex needs.","Nearly 80% of what influences the person's health relates to non-traditional medical and behavioral issues such as food, housing, transportation, and health care finances. Improving care for society is behind our partnership initiative with the American Medical Association to standardize how data regarding critical social and environmental factors is collected, processed, and integrated.","Nearly two dozen new ICD-10 codes will be used to trigger referrals to social and government services to better address people's unique needs connecting them directly to local and national resources in their communities.","Finally, our Net Promoter Scores continued to advance meaningfully in the first quarter 2019 as we march towards an aggressive target of 70 by 2025. The people we serve will benefit as we advance quality and value and in turn, provide growth and returns for shareholders.","Before I ask Andrew Witty to update you on Optum, I know there has been public discussion about Medicare for all proposals. We view the discussion first through the prism of our mission and how individuals can be better served and the health system can work better for all. From their perspective, we welcome the contrast between these proposals and the kind of real progress we are talking about on this call and discuss with you at our November conference founded on durable and modern information, technology, and clinical capabilities.","The wholesale disruption of American health care being discussed in some of these proposals would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation's health system, and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best. And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs, all without fundamentally increasing access to care.","The path forward is to achieve universal coverage and it could be substantially reached through existing public and private platforms. Meaningful progress in health care lives and national and state leaders continuing to work collaboratively with the innovative and proven private sector solutions to achieve the goals we all want, a modern, reliable, informed, and aligned health care system that offers the access, choice, and coverage protections people seek at a fair cost to the individuals and society as a whole.","Together, we need to operationalize real changes that promote an interoperable secured digital infrastructure allowing information to be shared securely and widely so proper clinical decisions can be made and acted upon by qualified physicians with aligned incentives for achieving better outcomes.","Changes that eliminate unnecessary and costly regulatory frameworks and taxes that address underinvestment in social determinants of health, and changes that encourage people to take accountability to modify lifestyle behaviors that drive a significant percentage of their lifetime health care needs.","The best system is one, which is informed, engaged and aligned where people, their doctors in the private and public sectors work together to improve or sustain individual health while improving the performance of the health system for everyone.","We are encouraged to see the United States is on an improving path. For 16 straight months, the healthcare's relative economic burden on society has lessened. While recent year-over-year spending growth at just over 4% is still too high, it is less than considerably due to the better management of price inflation and the earlier and more effective management of care and lower cost settings.","The progress and ideas we have and we'll discuss further today will take healthcare to an entirely new level of quality, cost, choice and coverage in a proven and lasting way, ensuring the U.S. health system better serves and supports all Americans.","Now, let me turn it to Andrew Witty, CEO of Optum to discuss Optum's focus, strong operating and financial results, and growing forward momentum. Andrew?","Andrew Witty","Thank you, Dave.","Our next chapter involves accelerating digital, transforming pharmacy care through OptumRx and reinventing healthcare services through OptumCare. While, allowing all of Optum's resources to better serve patients directly and supporting the work of physicians, hospitals and health plans who also serve them.","Primary care represents well under 10% of medical cost that has a profound influence on the other 90% of the cost and quality of care. Within OptumHealth we offer densely rate, local care options built on a foundation of owned and operated primary care alongside aligned networks, together improving how the health system is accessed and used downstream.","Today, we serve millions of patients across the approximately 80 health plans and payers, in this year virtually every local OptumCare practice will participate in advanced value-based care arrangement.","Our clinical team continues to advance performance with our physicians delivering, better quality outcomes with 99% to seniors served through advance value-based arrangements receiving a star rating of four stars or higher.","Delivering lower costs with practices serving Medicare Advantage participants at as much as 30% lower cost than original Medicare, and 10% to 15% lower than typical Medicare Advantage, and with higher satisfaction with an NPS of just under 80.","In addition to primary care and local communities, we own and operate surgical care centers, neighborhood urgent care center, community pharmacy dispensaries, and in some markets, hospitalist and specialty and ancillary care capabilities, such as office space consist of specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology services.","For example, our new OptumCare Cancer Center in Nevada takes an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to providing patient centric care in a professional and compassionate setting. This outpatient program delivers integrated medical, surgical and radiation oncology, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, imaging, palliative care, and 24-hour oncology urgent care.","This is one of the ways we are exploring value-based specialty model that uniquely aligns while our primary care and ambulatory capabilities, grounding in a physician led culture of evidence-based medicine and enhanced by academic and community partnerships. All of these services produce better outcomes than outdated and costly facility-based alternative and generate high NPS, because the patient experience is distinctively better.","We're accelerating the process of connecting these elements to create informed comprehensive open-market care systems seamlessly supporting the patients we serve, all on a fiercely multi-payer basis, while supporting physicians seeking to operate practices at their fullest clinical capabilities.","Our journey of adding and enabling new locations to extend the reach, while deepening our clinical offerings will continue to improve our impact for years to come. We are architecting a more broadly informed, engaged and aligned healthcare system, one that responds better to consumer preferences while easing the burden of healthcare on society.","This quarter's growth in revenue per consumer served 14% of last year indicates we\u2019re taking responsibility from a more of a consumer's health and serving them more deeply and compressively.","On March 12, OptumRx extended our leadership on negotiated drug discounts by announcing that we will only serve new employees onto pharmacy benefit business after January 1, 2020 that provides consumer discounts to the point of sale. This replaces the current system, which employer's typically elect to flow rebate back to all plan participants to lower their premiums.","Benefits of this new approach are clear. Our data shows patient's prescription adherence improves up to 16% depending on plan design and we know patients health ultimately improved, when they follow physician orders for drug regimens. This approach is been proven to achieve medical cost savings of up to $300 per member per year and we have received strongly positive feedback from employers, employer coalitions, industry observers, regulators and policy leaders.","We're also seeing strong response to PreCheck MyScript which offers care providers instant information on efficacy cost and alternative drug choices directly within the physician's workflow. Nearly 150,000 physicians are using this technology now, up 77% since December.","Our near-term plans for pharmacy care services remain focused on achieving the highest quality outcomes, the lowest net cost of drug for patients, and the best patient experience. Market response continues to be outstanding. 2019 was a good sales year for us. And with robust RFP activity and a couple of significant wins already, 2020 should be even better.","OptumInsight the technology and analytics engine of our enterprise continues to provide our customers strategic insights to improve health system performance. We're in the process of launching a newly develop services and technology offerings with our state customers.","These end-to-end approaches used advanced technologies to modernize traditional Medicaid administrative offerings, including the comprehensive integration of cutting-edge Optum Analytics services and capabilities deeply enhancing the breadth depth and effectiveness of these state administered offerings.","As Dave mentioned in consumer digital health, we've started beta testing the consumer version of the IHR and envision a stage deployment starting around mid-year. We also studied the impact of deploying the IHR for people in the Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial markets and found better outcomes, lower cost and improve patient experience. When placed in the hands of a qualified high-performing doctor in a value-based system, the IHR meaningfully reduces healthcare costs.","In a similar way, on March 28, we launched a consumer version of the PreCheck MyScript technology called MyScript finder. Rally now has over 24 million registered users, having grown adoption by over two million people in this quarter alone.","Consumers earned a record $200 million in rewards in the first quarter, demonstrating their high engagements. And forward thinking employers have made more than $1 billion in annual rewards available to people who've taken actions to improve their own health.","Our software engineering are now building digital payment and physician office visits scheduling capabilities and deploying artificial intelligence and biometric data to improve post-acute patient recovery and reduce hospital readmissions.","Rally and platforms like the IHR are just two critical elements of the more modern information and digitally enabled health system. Particularly when coupled with rewards and support tool they enable physicians to more effectively manage their patients at scale.","Turning to Optum's financial results. First quarter revenues of $26.4 billion grew 12%, led by OptumHealth growth of 17%. We added $7 million adjusted scripts achieved 14% growth in backlog and now serve two million more people at OptumHealth.","Optum's operated margin of 7.1% expanded 10 basis point over last year's first quarter, contributing to 14% growth in operating earnings to nearly $1.9 billion in the quarter. These results illustrate our steady momentum as customers respond to the innovation insight and the value that Optum provides.","Now I'll turn the call over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealth's CEO.","Steve Nelson","Thank you, Andrew.","The market is responding to UnitedHealthcare's practical innovations, personalization and service performance on behalf of those we serve. Within just the past quarter, we've been awarded contracts to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in North Carolina and Arizona. And again drove strong growth in serving people in Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans.","Our innovative Navigate4Me service addresses the personalized holistic care needs of our senior population. Medicare Advantage seniors with complex health issues like diabetes, congestive heart failure or multiple chronic conditions received concierge service from nearly 1,000 dedicated experts. Each serves as a single point of contact for the seniors.","Our navigators provide support for clinical and administrative needs, help patients follow their personalized care plans, coordinate care and address social determinants of health. Key to delivering this flexible personal service is the proprietary technology platform that supports navigators with integrated data, analytics and information specific to each patient and the results have been impressive.","We've seen a 14% reduction in hospitalization for people with congestive heart failure. And overall 19 point increase in NPS from patients who received our direct support. We're also better coordinating medical services through locally organized systems of care, highly capable of physical digital and virtual care delivery.","Our data shows that seniors in our Medicare Advantage Plan C on average about one-half the number of doctors have similar seniors using original Medicare. This means a simpler, less confusing experience and better outcomes for patients and better use of scarce health system resources overall.","It is not a coincidence that seniors are enrolling in private Medicare plans at a record pace with one-third of the nation's seniors served today by the private market. Collectively, Medicare Advantage plans provide significant savings and invest those savings in superior benefits not available under original Medicare.","Medicare Advantage fills in the significant gaps left by original Medicare, including coverage for pharmacy, dental, vision, hearing and personal wellness and fitness needs. Again, none of them are covered by original Medicare.","This strong trend toward greater use of private services includes the state Medicaid programs, for states are increasingly asking the private sector to take responsibility for the care of their most complex and chronically ill beneficiaries.","Managed care has a track record of reducing cost by better coordinating care for these people, while helping them become healthier. Looking at our first quarter financial performance, UnitedHealthcare's revenues grew 8% to $48.9 billion, serving three-quarters-of-a-million more people domestically with medical benefits in the quarter, led by growth in Medicare Advantage and in serving self-funded employers. UnitedHealthcare's operating earnings grew 23% over last year to nearly $3 billion in the quarter, with operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 6%.","We are hard at work on enabling our business for future growth. In Medicare Advantage, we believe we are well positioned to advance our market share. Further implementation work for recent Medicaid awards is in progress, coupled with our strong activity in the commercial group Medicare and global markets we expect to continue to drive sustained and diversified growth.","Now I'll turn the call over to UnitedHealth Group's Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. ","John Rex","Thank you, Steve.","Our initial quarter for 2019 positions us well to deliver on our full year financial commitments. To recap, revenues grew 9.3% to $60.3 billion, even after considering the negative 1.4% impact related to the health insurance tax deferral for 2019.","In the first quarter alone, this deferral helped improve affordability for the people we serve by more than $700 million. This tax adds billions in cost to system and constrains access and benefits for Americans. We continue to advocate and are hopeful for its permanent repeal.","In the quarter, the more than $5 billion revenue increase was led by same-store growth, well balanced across our benefits and services platforms. Medical cost trends continue to be well managed and consistent. Our view of forward trends and our first quarter medical care ratio of 82% continue to support our full year outlook for an MCR of 82.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","Favorable reserve development, up $300 million was consistent with the year ago level. And medical payables at 49 days were also stable with the year ago level. Earnings growth in the quarter was also driven by improvements in our operating cost position.","While the health insurance tax deferral lowers the operating cost ratio, beyond this factor, strong improvements in productivity more than offsets our ongoing investments to drive growth for the future. We will continue to pursue such investments as our focus remains firmly on the decade ahead. Overall, operating margins expanded 70 basis points over last year to 8%. And first quarter adjusted earnings per share up $3.73, grew 23% over last year.","First quarter cash flows of $3.2 billion were consistent with our expectations, recognizing that comparison with last year was affected by the health insurance tax deferral. Recall that reported cash flows were limited in the first three quarters of 2018 by collecting the health insurance tax from customers over the course of the year and then impacted in the fourth quarter by the $2.6 billion payment to the U.S. Treasury.","Additionally, we would note that certain government payments received in the second quarter of 2018 are not scheduled to be received until the third quarter of this year, simply due to calendar time.","All-in, we expect second half 2019 cash flows will be meaningfully above last year's, most notably in the third quarter, with second quarter commence slightly lower. We continue to expect double-digit percentage growth in cash flows from operations in 2019 to a range of $17.3 billion to $17.8 billion.","We continue to put capital to work to build the business for the benefit of both society and our shareholders with a robust organic and inorganic growth agenda. We are currently active in each of the five growth pillars previously detailed as we look ahead 10 years and expect to grow and diversify our earnings streams inside this focused, dedicated health care company.","We also returned $3.9 million to shareholders this quarter through the present and share repurchase activity. And return on equity was strong at 26.8%, rising 300 basis points from one year ago.","Looking forward, we entered the second quarter with strength, flexibility, and rising confidence in the positive impact we can have this year and far into the future. We continue to expect strong growth in adjusted net earnings in 2019, and have increased our outlook to a range of $14.50 to $14.75 per share. That would bring for one-year earnings growth rate to 13% to 15%, and our five and 20-year compound earnings growth rates to approximately 20% per year.","Dave?","David Wichmann","Thank you, John.","Over the past 45 years, UnitedHealthcare Group has grown consistently through the full range of macroeconomic, health care, legislative, and policy conditions, adapting and adjusting to deliver value for all those we serve in ever-changing environment. That value is rising at an accelerated pace.","As we execute against our multidimensional growth agenda and health care delivery, pharmacy, digital, consumer response to benefits and global. These efforts for suited scale position us uniquely as a technology-enabled healthcare company, delivering distinctive results to our customers and to society.","Taken together with our commitments to service, quality, and NPS, our investments in the coming wave of health care innovation, a movement we intend to lead and our multi-year, multibillion-dollar effort to improve our medical and operating cost basis for the benefit of our customers, we expect sustained growth and performance for UnitedHealth Group this year, in 2020, and for many years beyond.","Thank you. We will now take one question per caller please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Peter Costa","Good morning, and thank you for the Medicare for All discussion. Now it's your job to get your members and healthcare workers and employees to understand the same message that you gave to us. Moving on to the rebate structure, as drug rebates go away, can you tell us what that will do to margins in your PBM and to premiums in your healthcare plans?","David Wichmann","First, Peter thank you for the acknowledgment of the Medicare for All commentary. We will definitely fall-through to make sure that this is well understood because we think the options are clear between the government sponsored or government run system and the one we have to offer. So we'll make sure we keep moving in that direction.","Andrew, you do you want to take the pharmacy question?","Andrew Witty","Peter thanks for the question. I just like to make a couple of introductory questions and then I'll ask John Prince to say, comment specifically on the margin element.","I think in terms of this whole rebate conversation that's been going on, there were really two elements to this that we really need to keep a very close eye on. The first and most important of all of this is what is going to be the ongoing mechanism to ensure pricing discipline for pharmaceutical products.","As you well know the only mechanism that exists today is essentially the volume that\u2019s aggregated by companies like OptumRx to be able to then negotiate effectively with pharmaceutical companies who otherwise would have complete independence on what they do with their list prices.","That\u2019s something, which must not be lost in this set of conversations and discussions, which are going on at this time. There is a real risk that if there is a situation where rebates or a mechanism to replace rebate was not in place because the significant drug price inflation, over the next years that would set back a huge amount of the efforts that being achieved over the last 10 or 15 years to try and bring more control to this area.","The second part is -- to your question and I'll ask John to really give you a little bit more detail is, obviously, the migration for a company like OptumRx. And John has led a very successful strategy in first of all diversifying the pharmacy servicing offering from OptumRx, and secondly moving into a modern physician of passing forward at this point-of-sale to consumers.","You've seen a lot of progress there this quarter, and also developing the way in which we work with our customers to ensure there are mechanism of compensation for the service we delivered is less and less dependent on rebates, the vast majority of which we passed through to our customers.","John, if you like to add any specific detail?","John Prince","Peter thanks for question leading on OptumRx. We've been working for years on transforming our pharmacy care services in two ways; one, is expanding how we deliver value to our clients who are integrated medical behavioral pharmacy experience, lets focus on total cost of care and health outcomes.","We've also been very focused on driving the transparent business model where more and more of our revenues coming from administrative fees value sharing mechanisms that align us with the consumer the client's needs. So with that context, we see over time minimal impact from our margins, because if you look at the rebates and discounts that we managed.","Overall, rebates only exist on 7% of prescription, 90% of what we manage is generic with no rebates, 10% is brand and subset to that is rebatable drug, when you look at in the Medicare market today none of that value we\u2019ve managed from a discount rebate is held by us, it's 100% is passed on to our clients. And fully disclosed with CMS the 100% is passed on the Medicaid market, within our total client base. 98% of our discounts are passed on to our clients.","So when you look at an overall standpoint, we're driving that value and passing on to our client. Over time that remaining 2% is a client choice and how they want to pay for our services. And so our believe is that overtime that remaining 2% we would work with our clients to look for other alternatives for them to pay for our services, which we are actively encouraging to manage, how we get our paid for our services.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dave Windley","On Medicaid, wondered if you could comment on the progress in fixing or improving the performance of the handful of markets that you've called out in prior calls and in that context maybe comment on your decision to exit Iowa? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Sure. We'll do Dave. We're seeing nice progress in Medicaid. Year-over-year we saw nice progress in the quarter. But I think I'll have Heather Cianfrocco our CEO of that business. Over to you - those for you.","Heather Cianfrocco","Heather Cianfrocco leading Community & State. So as you mentioned, yes we highlighted that we had pressure in a handful of markets. Last year, we continue to make progress as David Wichmann noted. We saw this quarter some nice growth in our operating earnings year-over-year and we also saw a couple of good wins. So you heard us talk about North Carolina as well as our Arizona Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities contracts. We also saw strong decent growth.","I'll tell you that, with respect to that handful of markets, we've made progress in most of them and we're working to improve our performance. Our performance still is not exactly where we expected to be, and we'll continue to work on that through the year and you can expect to see improvement there. But Iowa was some of those markets.","And unfortunately, even though we have put the same work into Iowa, there was a funding increase last year by the administration, due to systemic underfunding of that program over the years, inability to catch-up with what continue to be medical cost pressure and some really unique system design elements of that program recognized across the industry we were unable to make that a sustainable market for us and continue to deliver the high-quality services that we believe Iowa deserves from UnitedHealthcare.","So we did make the decision to exit that market. You'll see us exit Iowa, unfortunately by June 30th. We're proud of the services that are employers predominantly have delivered in that market and the impact we think we've made on the hundreds of thousands of Medicaid members. But with respect to the rest of the markets, we're continuing to make progress. We think we'll see improvement in some funding cycles that are \u2013 they are upcoming over the next few months and we're on track with our performance optimizations.","Dave Windley","Great. Thank you.","David Wichmann","Dave in summary nice improvement quarter-over-quarter, first quarter, a solid operating earnings growth despite negative impact of the HIF. But I think it's -- also should be said that we're still underperforming in this business and it'll probably take us until 2020 to get to our full performance expectation which we're performing at a margin somewhere in the 3% to 5% zone.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Justin Lake","Can you give us an update on progress with the government around the DMG acquisition? And would also appreciate any commentary around management decision to do about two-thirds of the full year share repo in the first quarter? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Sure. I'll take DMG and then John Rex can take share repo. So we remain very excited about this opportunity to expand geographic reach with DMG and to serve more people. It is a critical part of the strategy that we have around reinventing health care delivery to access more markets and at the same time then go much deeper into those markets to make them work much more effectively.","At this stage, we have a clear path to approval in closing of the transaction, but unfortunately, we cannot comment on further details or timing at this stage. We are working through a couple of matters that remain. John, you want to touch on repo?","John Prince","Sure. The $3 billion of share repo that we did in the quarter is against our $4 billion to $5 billion full year outlook. It is about the same percentage that we did in the year ago quarter. Also we did $2.65 billion in the year ago 1Q. So we also did a significant portion of our full year in that 1Q.","Certainly, I would say that market conditions warranted that if we look at this year particularly warranted that we accelerate our timing on share repurchase. We try to maintain good flexibility in terms of how we approach that program and also maintained good flexibility in our balance sheet overall. So that was kind of -- that was really decision was premised on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette","So I have a high-level question on Medicare Part D related to the rebate proposal. I think when we spoke at our conference last month and the view was that UNH and other Part D players could prepare multiple bids to cover all the different scenarios for 2020. Even now with the CMS guidance stating that plan sponsorship data on the current status quo, but then we'll provide protection with that demo program. Now the question is I'm curious if you think this demo program is a fair compromise for Part D plan sponsors? Or does this make you have to perhaps rethink your Part D bidding strategy for next year? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Yes, it certainly can be. But Brian, you want to touch on that Brian Thompson?","Brian Thompson","Steven, Brian Thompson here. We certainly support the administration's effort to lower drug cost for seniors. I do think that over the long-term, this could provide lower pricing, we have better transparency, but we want to balance that as he suggested against premium increases here in the short term.","For context, if we exclude members today without any cost sharing, we suggest that perhaps the one-third will benefit in the near term leading two-thirds perhaps. We're soft as you mentioned timing right now remains uncertain, but CMS clarified the bids should assume the current rules as they apply. And as you mentioned, CMS is providing some protections in form of a risk corridor, that plans it had lowered premiums with rebates, we'll be able to apply and we're certainly appreciative of that guidance.","I will suggest that it won't fully mute an increase in member premiums, but will be helpful. We certainly intend to participate in the demonstration to the extent the new rule does impact our plans. I will say that I don't think the corridor protections are going to meaningful change bid strategies, or competitive behaviors.","It's important to remember, these are partial protections and they only apply if the rule passes, so plans need to be disciplined in their pricing regardless. I will just leave with the comment around this context. Important to remember, we're only talking about rebates and where they apply, as they've ever been retained by plans, whether that's point-of-sale or in premium and when. So while there's certainly some uncertainty, we appreciate the addition clarity that we've received from CMS and we'll be ready to bid here in early June like we always are.","David Wichmann","So it is a constructive step forward. One that is born in the collaboration between CMS and the Part D carriers and we look forward to participating in the Part D program.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Frank Morgan","We'll stay on rebates. I'm just curious with regard to the recent announcement you made, any interest so far or any color around what your current self-insured customer base? How that's being received? And do you think that will any way affect new business when you going into 2020? Thanks.","David Wichmann","I think there's growing interest, broadly. But, John Prince, you want to start with OptumRx?","John Prince","It's John Prince with OptumRx. I'd say, first of all, one; we are pleased with why we did it, because there's significant bias from a consumer affordability standpoint. And so, I think, when you have conversations with customers and with other stakeholders, they're very interested in what is the impact of the discounts that we have negotiated on behalf of our clients and its material. So its $130 of value per script -- per eligible scripts which is material.","The value in terms of driving higher adherence is also important from a health outcome. So, when we have conversations with our clients, they're very interested in our data and understand how it's impacted consumers. We've had very positive interactions and feedback on it.","So I'd say, when you look at the health plan market in addition to UnitedHealthcare, we've had strong interest with our other 45 health plans, where a lot of them are actually looking at how they would incorporate that. And so, I think, there is strong interest in other clients that are on health plan basis to adopt it.","When you look at the employer market, there's strong interest in new clients as well as existing clients interested in how to phase that in overtime. And remember, in terms of what we announced, this does not affect our 1\/1\/20 selling season. This just requires everybody after 1\/1\/20, so starting January 2, 2020.","David Wichmann","So a bottom line of that, Frank, was there's growing interest in the market. It's a little bit slower to adopt. We'd like to see faster adoption. And we are clearly taking a position to, at least, for a certain plan designs to make sure that consumers are getting those discounts to apply it at the point-of-sale, which we know improves adherence and hopefully will improve their long-term health. Thank you for the question, Frank. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kevin Fischbeck","The market seems to be concerned to some degree about -- I guess both maybe on the managed-care side and PBM side after these are good point-of-sale rebates or move away from rebates entirely. So, I just want to get may be a little bit more color from you about your experience so far in 2019 on the commercial risk side, on the business that you moved over? I assume that the margin profile there is similar to what it was previously, but may be just comment on that.","And then as far as the PBM side with these new contracts that you're talking about post-2020, I assume that the economics in that business is also similar to your core business, so may be just confirm those two points.","David Wichmann","Yes, Kevin I think the most compelling part of point-of-sale rebate application and the commercial markets for UnitedHealthcare and I'll have Dan comment on this in a moment as well, but is the fact that per eligible script, we're serving consumers a $130 per script. And we're seeing adherence rates as high as -- improvements as much as 16%.","So, the impact on society and the people we serve is probably the most compelling part that I want to remain unnoticed. I think as it relates to the financial effects of it is fairly much -- pretty much in line with what are expectations were overall, but Dan do you have any additional comments?","Dan Schumacher","That's right Dave. Our expectations on the outcomes for very much in keeping with what we thought going on. And the reality is, it's very meaningful impact for the individuals that are taking high-cost specialty medications that Dave mentioned and they are very compelling savings for them. But when you look at it the overall medical and pharmacy offering, it's a more modest impact.","David Wichmann","And overall it was a modest impact in part because there is that perception that the people are deeply exposed to price inflation and pharmacy and the reality is that most the plan designed that exist in the market today still have significant price protections in place like a pharmacy co-pay as an example. John you want to broaden that up for OptumRx?","John Prince","Yes sure. Maybe to set the overall point was just the driving the plan for rebates does not impact our bottom-line or our economics. This is around driving solutions that drive affordability to the consumers we serve and that's why we're doing it. This is making sure that the value that we extract from the market actually goes to the consumers and so I think that's the core element on it.","We do believe that it's important to have mechanisms like a discount that we negotiated with pharma manufacturers in order to control cost in outer years. So, I think that's also left in the discussion is that there needs to be mechanisms that check against the price increases in the future years.","Operator","Next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sarah James","I was hoping that you could update us on some of the growth initiatives for OptumCare. Thinking about recent comments that you've made about may be that business growing to multiples of the size that it is, then growing from 30 markets to 75. How should we think about the mix of products that you want to target during that growth and the pacing if it would be ratable growth over time or if it's going to come in larger chunk due to our focus on M&A. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Andrew Witty?","Andrew Witty","Yes, Sarah thanks very much. Andrew Witty. In a second I'm just going to hand over to Dr. Wyatt Decker. It's good opportunity for me to introduce to you. He's just joined us from the senior leadership at Mayo Clinic Network in Arizona. And he's taken over as the leader of our OptumHealth business. Andrew Hayek is also here today, who is now working alongside me directly in identifying and building some of the new growth platforms we anticipate within the OptumHealth portfolio.","And that really speaks to - and let me just make it very specific comments to your questions there. We see a wide range of growth opportunities within the OptumHealth portfolio and with the OptumCare's portfolio specifically that really ranges from building out the debt in the major cities and conventions where we already have presence. And you'll see continued efforts to fill in those networks and to develop, essentially a coordinated network of care delivery in those cities.","That's something, which you should expect to see on relentless ongoing basis. But, of course, we will also be looking at further extension of that network across the country through acquisition and elsewhere. And, obviously, when the DMG deal closes that will be a significant expansion of that in that very, very direct way.","As literally quarter-by-quarter, I think we see more and more potential for the ambulatory network that we're building across the OptumCare portfolio. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the opening of our first cancer care center in Las Vegas this quarter, I think is just signaling all the direction I\u2019ll probably want to follow.","Let me ask Dr. Wyatt Decker, just to may be add some specific thoughts from his position. Wyatt?","Wyatt Decker","Thank you, Andrew, and Sarah thank you for the question. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here with you this morning, and I can't tell you how please I am to have joined UnitedHealth Group. I have confident that there is no organization that is better positioned to create the future healthcare than this one.","I would just add that OptumCare's vision for care is to create leading value-based patient centric physician health care system in the United States and we will do this through local markets where we can weave together the assets that Andrew has already touched on and we will do this through organic growth of our -- we're already in 36 markets.","And if you include our MedExpress and ambulatory surgical centers, it would be 60 markets. We have 38,000 employed in affiliate physicians, and this will continue to grow organically as well as inorganically.","But most exciting is what happens when you bring together, a value-based reimbursement system with a culture of commitment to patients and providers and layer on technology. And that's what we're committed to doing at - in OptumCare. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Josh Raskin","Question really around just the broad risk membership segment. So commercial, Medicare, Medicaid and I know you don't typically update revenues of membership stayed with the quarters, but I guess other than the obvious Iowa exit. It is the broadly the risk membership numbers came in a little lower than we were expecting. Any changes to the outlook there by any of the segments? Or any color you can give in the individual areas?","David Wichmann","Joshua, we typically don't update those particularly this early in the year. Steve Nelson, do you want to comment on growth overall and engage your team accordingly?","Steve Nelson","May be just a few broad comments about UnitedHealthcare overall and how we think about growth? As you know we start with really strong market positions across all the businesses that you mentioned and have a history of the growth in those positions. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments that, that we're going to add over a million medical members this year and so great growth track record.","Such as we look forward, our intention and our ambition is to continue to grow, grow those positions particularly as we think about some of the really strategic segments such as Medicare Advantage and build Special Needs Plans, where we have invested in capabilities and really strengthen our product offerings and some really innovative collaborations with Optum as well to really position ourselves to grow there not only this year, but continue to grow share as we look forward.","Having said that, as you look across all the risks of different businesses, we are looking for long-term sustainable growth and so we do remain disciplined in our pricing and we're very intentional about where we grow and how we grow. And then that really just - I'll just end by saying that the path for growth for us is continued is a continued to focus on value and the products that we offer need to be innovative, they need to be directed towards, where the consumer needs our help. We are very adamant about driving a better experience, while we lower the cost and improve the outcomes.","So we continue to be really bullish and optimistic about our growth opportunities, but we're going to be really thoughtful about it, and maybe I'd ask Dan to talk a little bit more about how that commercial for insured and some of the progress we\u2019re seeing there.","Dan Schumacher","As it relates to the commercial risk based enrollment, we had expected declines in the first quarter and that was largely driven by two public sector clients, and so similar to the enrollment pattern we experienced last year. We do expect to grow over the remaining quarters of the year. And inside the results, I'll tell you, we are growing in some markets and segments that are very important to us.","And as Steve mentioned, we are very focused on increasing the value of our offerings. And we do that through a combination of some of the innovations you heard of earlier, deeper collaborations with high performing care providers, OptumCare as well as others, and also contributions from our multi-year multibillion dollar cost effort.","So we feel well positioned. And then I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that, we're pleased with the results that we've driven on the self-funded side. We've had a very focused effort to return to growth and we did that nicely in the first quarter. We grew strongly on an organic basis, and we also supplemented that with some nice M&A as well. So overall, well positioned and feel good about it.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","I want to delve into the MLR just a little bit and see if I could maybe roughly just tie out some numbers. So, MLR up about 60 basis points year-over-year, I think given the comments you made last \u2013 a year ago quarter about flu contributing about 50 basis points, it looks like MLR is maybe up 110 very in line with your guidance for the full year. But it still looks better than what we would estimate health insurance fee might push that number up roughly 140, and then government growing faster than commercial might be another 25 bps or so. So it still looks like, if I'm right, kind of an adjusted up 110 is still improving the real underlying trend primarily excluding the HIF. And I just wanted to see if those numbers sort of ballpark? And if so, where are you seeing sort of the true underlying improvement?","David Wichmann","Thanks, Gary. John Rex.","John Prince","Yes. Thanks, Gary. Good morning. So I'd start with the medical care ratio in the quarter it was in line with our expectations for the 1Q. I think you're correct in terms of the things you're seeing across that in terms of some of your observations that would create movement and such. I would point out in the 1Q one of the comments we made last quarter was around the workday content of 1Q 2019 versus 1Q 2018 having some impact which is one of the reasons we wanted to create some awareness around that.","And that's just being calendar's fairly stable over the course of the year, but there are differences in quarters. And so when you have that content sometimes we would point that out. So we had one fewer weak day in the 1Q 2019 than 1Q 2018. The opposite affect occur is in 3Q this year. Actually, we have one more day in the 3Q 2019 than 3Q 2018.","So no annual impact, it's just the quarterly timing how it flows across the year. So 1Q benefit 3Q gets that offsetting the weak day content that's where you expected this fall. That's really a\u2026","Gary Taylor","One clarification if I could. Since there's not much Medicaid growth this year which is usually much higher MLR is the MA enrollment growth, is that really any material effect on MLR in the guidance for the year?","David Wichmann","No, I wouldn't call it material.","Operator","We will take our next question from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Fidel","Just interested in your early thoughts on the Medicare outlook now for 2020 in terms of sustaining sort of the MA growth profile, now that we have the final rates visibility and sort of assuming that the HIF comes back next year. So maybe sort of thinking about sort of how you view the right outlook at this point on a net basis for 2020 an individual MA. And then maybe an update on how the group MA pipeline is shaping up for 2020 as well?","David Wichmann","Brian Thompson.","Brian Thompson","Sure. Thanks for the question Scott. First off, we're pleased with our growth year for the first quarter in 2019 and our positioning. As we have said before, we looked at 2019 because of long term view expecting for the potential headwind that return of the tax in 2020. As we're seeing the rates now, we're encouraged by the rate improvement that we've seen since the advanced notice, up about a point, but still not enough to cover the expected return of the health insurance tax. And I think that'll be pressure point industry wide.","But what I can say to UnitedHealthcare in particular is that like I said, we went to market in 2019 with a long term view and expectant of this headwind. We're thoughtful and disciplined and intend to approach 2020 with the goal of keeping our benefits and our margins as stable as possible despite these headwinds.","While at the same time driving continued growth like we have demonstrated now over the course of the last five to six years and improving our operating earnings overall. That's been the formula that we've executed against successfully and intend to do so again here in 2020. So optimistic about the outlook and are positioning here ending the first quarter 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","You covered a lot of ground, maybe just one on the business combination announced today, if you could give us any color on that, maybe the revenue and earnings impact for the quarter and the year and whether that was contemplated in the prior 2019 guidance? That'll be helpful. Thank you.","David Wichmann","It's a very small acquisition, Steve, it's of an ASO based business or a self-funded business, about 630,000 lives, if I recall correctly. Relatively small purchase price, nice tuck-in acquisition, brings us a few new capabilities and technologies. But quite pleased to align with this company, but relatively small. And not really influencing our earnings expectations for the year.","Operator","Next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice","I just thought I'd ask about the PBM selling season for 2020. I assume we're well into that now. I think Andrew's comments about some early successes may be flush that out. I guess, there's two aspects to it I'd ask you about. You got more people that seem to be trying to pitch the synchronization strategies you guys have been doing for a while, is that changing the dynamics of the selling season in anyway? And then, I know a few years ago, the Health Transformation Alliance was a big discussion point. Those contracts sound like some of them may now be coming up for renewal. Does that present any challenges or opportunities for you?","David Wichmann","Andrew?","Andrew Witty","Just before I ask John to comment more specifically about 2020. I think what we are seeing is, some of the benefits of a very substantial amount of innovation around our offering design that John and his team have been developing, partly in anticipation of changes in the policy environment that obviously been touched on already in this call conversation, but also taking advantage of technology and other levers that have been brought alongside the traditional core PBM of OptumRx.","I think it's that combination of all of those things, really, leaning into exploring value-based propositions and really being extremely dynamic in the way in which we start to bring to bear some of these different tools that has created a very competitive set of offerings. Let me ask John just to describe you how that's landing for us this year and projected for next year.","John Prince","Jay, it's John Prince. In terms of our 2020 selling season it is still early, but we have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities. We've already had some really good wins for 2020. We've sold several large health plans. They stayed in a variety of large employers.","Two good examples that -- of large wins already was the Hubbard program announcement and of our partnership in early January. They selected us because of our partnership around total cost of care, clinical outcomes, consumer experience sort of resonating, what Andrew Witty just mentioned, around our innovation around the consumer and clinical outcomes.","Another example of a good win for 2020 is, with HealthTrust and their division for CoreTrust, they selected OptumRx as their exclusive pharmacy care services provider to improve the performance of healthcare. We'll be their key strategic channel partner for health systems in Fortune 2000 companies.","In the overall market, you asked around, our value story, I think, our value proposition is resonating their market. Others might be now using the same vocabulary as we have, but we've been working at this for five years. We continue to modernize our offering, continue to innovate around outcomes and also we continued to expand the services that we have to support unique communities and partnerships. And I think that's also a differentiation for us in the market. Thank you.","David Wichmann","It's a great question. What you're seeing there is a innovation and play, starting with synchronization, but really the development of a modern, much more modern pharmacy care services business that continues to stay out of the marketplace and is really responding to the needs of employers, health plans, and others out there and seeing the growth as a result.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ana Gupte","My question was about Telehealth, I think I saw a sort of national TV ads on Virtual Health UnitedHealthcare. I was wondering if you could comment on what your strategy is, is this mostly for urgent care or is it also belongs to panic care management. So, is that differ by pair mix and how are you preparing for the CMS inclusion of the Telehealth in the bundle and then can you talk about how this dovetails with your OptumCare strategy of MedExpress and employed physicians -- thinking any single vendor or multi-vendor contracts or anything?","David Wichmann","Thank you, Ana. Andrew?","Andrew Witty","Yes. Ana thanks so much for the question. So, I think Telehealth is an interesting potential ingredient for how we think about delivering improved outcome and value for patients and customers within our OptumCare's environment.","But I think really the central -- so, I think the really central part is to ensure that we have a really, really strong integrated physical engagement with patients as a core platform. That needs to be very much empowered by information, clinical insight, and needs to be real-time. So, that's very much with we are building.","I think then wrapped around that, we envision substantial portfolios of digital engagement and also platform such as Telehealth. But I think on their own, they have relatively limited runway, frankly. I think as a component or as an ingredient of a much more comprehensive care delivery platform, which is what we envisioned, clearly a role, but very much alongside what you're seeing has developed within the OptumCare's environment, very much patient-centric, very much focused on the best possible clinical outcome, focused on the best possible patient experience at the lowest possible cost.","We think that is a strategy, which will require modern technologies, innovative technologies like Telehealth, but it fundamentally will be built around the physician-led physical engagement of the patient.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Lance Wilkes","Yes, just had a question on medical cost trend and just general kind of medical cost performance for the first quarter. Can you just talk a little about how it's tracking to the guidance you guys have given? And in particular, are you seeing better than expected results on the pharmacy side as well as anything else offsetting that?","David Wichmann","I assume you're referring to commercial Lance?","Lance Wilkes","Yes, I was thinking about your commercial medical cost trend target of 6%.","David Wichmann","Dan?","Dan Schumacher","Sure, good morning Lance. I would tell you that our medical cost in the quarter were very much in line with our expectation and on track as we look to the full year. That's 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Frankly, I wouldn't call out anything as being different than what we had expected coming in.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Ransom","We attempted to kill some trees last week and tease out some of the organic growth numbers from the acquired growth. The number that was astounding to me at least was that we calculated the mid-teens organic growth at OptumHealth, which as you know would be 3x the organic growth of any kind of stand-alone services providers that's track publicly. So I was wondering, if you could just give us some help as to how you get to those numbers that are frankly 3x anything else we see out there in the stand-alone market? Thanks.","David Wichmann","It's compelling growth platform. And it's doing exactly what we had hoped and designed it to do. Andrew?","Andrew Witty","Yes, I mean listen, John thanks so much for the question. I think what you'll see within OptumHealth is really a whole series of self reinforcing very complementary growth drivers all beginning to kick in together. And I think the leadership team, Andrew Hayek's leadership team now led by Dr. Wyatt Decker, I think deserve a lot of credit for bringing on stream all of these various activities.","As you look across, you're seeing geographic growth; we're seeing a greater shift of physician groups to value. We're seeing those physician groups deliver great quality of clinical care, a better cost. That -- making those practices more attractive for membership clearly. And as you think through, you can layer on level after level and each of them kind of amplify the growth velocity of the business.","So we feel very good about the track record that this business is the delivering. Honestly, I think it was still in the very early days of the evolution of the OptumHealth and OptumCare's business you\u2019ll see substantial degrees of innovation over the next year or two. We've got significant ambitions for layer in on and developing the Rally platform for example alongside the OptumCare platform.","And as you heard in the prepared remarks, things like the OptumCare cancer center begins to open up yet another dimension and the work that Andrew Hayek is now leading alongside me directly to look at further expansion points for the OptumHealth, OptumCare's agenda. So early days, we feel good about where we are so far. Very clearly a function of many streams of work beginning to gear together very positively.","David Wichmann","Yes. Just expect us to continue to invest in this category and we're talking five to 10 years out to build this health system that has the capacity to make a real difference on outcomes quality and patient experience and costs frankly, delivering really strong\u2026","John Ransom","If you can permit me a follow-up. How much of it is the move where the primary care doctor goes from getting $0.05, $0.10 on $1 to getting the full dollar. Is that bigger than a mousetrap in terms of the overall growth? Or is that just a small piece of it?","Andrew Witty","John, a key part. I mean, as you know a key part of the philosophy of how we\u2019re developing OptumCare is exactly that journey and we believe that's very important. We see repeatedly that that helps facilitate and free up physicians to make great decisions on behalf of their patients, ensure the best care is delivered with the best possible cost.","So yes that's a key part of the journey, and it's certainly a part of philosophy of how we run that set of clinics, yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","I just want to get a clarification, Dave because there's some headline that came across regarding your commentary about the Medicaid business. I recall hearing earlier you saying that, you expect to get your target margins by 2020, but headlines are coming across saying probably take us 2022. Can you just clarify what you had said earlier?","David Wichmann","Our expectation is that we'll be in the zone of our target margins probably closer to the bottom end of that in 2020.","Charles Rhyee","And my question was actually, if I could ask my question around points of rebates. You guys had mentioned not just you, but all the PBM's in general that point-of-sale rebates have been available to the employer market for some time \u2013 it just wasn't really an appetite for it. You guys are now making decision to move ahead in the commercial market with this kind of strategy. Does this put you at risk here that employers aren\u2019t going to be still that attracted to this type of model as you move forward?","David Wichmann","Yes. It's possible that that would be the case. But for situations where consumers are exposed to high inflation or list prices of drugs, we think it's important that discounts are applied at the point of service. And so we believe that that's the proper plan design. Again, where there is a high-deductible health plan or there is other benefit designs that we've patients exposed.","So, again, we're seeing as much as a 16% improvement and adherence. And we believe the long-term health effects for the people we serve will be substantial as a result. So we think we're doing the right thing for people and if that means, we have to offer designs that are more restrictive we will. Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Zach Sopcak","To that last point do you think the adherence by the Fed and improvement in cost that you're seeing in your commercial book is translatable to Medicare? Or do you think you would get more leverage just given a general sicker population?","David Wichmann","Theoretically, yes, we believe so. We'd like to see it prove out over time, but we'd probably expect the benefits in the Medicare population to be more immediate than you might see in a \u2013 in a commercial population. Thanks for the question. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Just one point of clarification and then a question. The point of clarification just on 2020 selling season comments, is there any way to quantify where you're thinking your positioning might be in terms of a net basis going in for next year on the PBM business? And then my question was just on Duals and if you could just provide a little bit more color on the importance of Duals to your growth, what you're seeing so far this year and where you expect that to go over the rest of this year and next year? Thank you.","David Wichmann","Yes. Steve, we're not going to comment on 2020 at this stage. But we can answer the Duals question. Heather?","Heather Cianfrocco","Sure. The Duals, you mean, the Duals special needs program as you know UnitedHealthcare has been in this space and growing and growing strong results over 30% of the market today. But we really invest in the Duals special needs program is because we see that it's really the best for our consumers. It\u2019s the aligned benefits, care coordination that our members cannot get from Medicaid or Medicare alone, and often they get supplemental benefits on top of that.","So as we continue to see alignment with states and the federal government to make this program even better. It's a place we're going to continue to invest. We had another strong year in 2018 as you know the quarter, first quarter we saw strong growth in this again, and we think that's really our experience. Our Medicaid footprint our unique programs through Optum like our HouseCalls program and our strong brand and service surgical specialty. So this will be an area see us continue to invest and we expect a strong growth again this year in 2019.","Operator","We'll take our question from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Newshel","Also quickly on the tax rate. It was close to the full-year guidance, but in the past, the first quarter has been lower due to stock comp expense timing. So is there any change in seasonality this year or any change to expectations for the full-year tax rate?","David Wichmann","John?","John Prince","It's John Rex. No change in our full year outlook I would say in terms of the 1Q. And there was a little reduced impact from a share based exercise benefit, as you realize that has impact that typically why the 1Q trends lower than other quarters, because there's more activity there. And there was just the volume of exercise that was just a little bit lighter and that's probably likely due to share price fluctuation but that was it.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Michael. Are there any questions remaining?","Operator","We have one question remaining on the line.","David Wichmann","Okay.","Operator","From Matthew Borsch with BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matthew Borsch","I'll make this quick you've been very, very patient going through all the questions. Just curious to ask at this stage of the game, are you concerned that you'll be loading a lot on price going into 2020? And clearly the industry fee assuming that comes back is going to be something that was out of pricing that's going to come back into pricing in 2020. But you've also got maybe something to add on to pricing with the PBM change or maybe not take to your pricing, but the employers do effectively if they're not using the rebate to reduce employee side premiums. Is that going to be a factor as you're going into next year?","David Wichmann","Matt. Good question. I think as you know we're already have converted or we're in process of converting the $8 million fully-insured commercialize to move to point-of-sale rebates, so that consideration has already played out for the most part overall.","I think Brian talked earlier about how he has positioned a multi-year strategy and very important commentary from him about maintaining benefits stability and maintaining margins through the 2020 time period here recognizing that there is some friction on rising cost structures overall.","And I don't really see a meaningful impact on our self-funded market either from the modification that we've made on point-of-sale announced earlier this year. The thing I am concerned about is the return of the health insurance tax in 2020. That will increase the cost to health care by at least $20 billion for 142 million people.","And if you do the math on that that increased premiums for a senior couple by $500 dollars and for families with small business coverage by about the same amount. And that outcome from our standpoint is entirely unacceptable.","The healthcare already costs too much in these unnecessary taxes layered on top of what is already in high-cost health system is just untenable. So we continue to pursue a deferral, if not an outright repeal on behalf of those we serve. We can't comment on or speculate on the outcome at this stage where we're operating as if the law is the law. And that there is no deferral, but we certainly hope and will continue to advocate aggressively on behalf of the consumers we serve to keep these healthcare costs in check.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue.","David Wichmann","Okay, great. Well, thank you. To sum up our discussion today UnitedHealth Group began 2019 with strong operational and financial performance from both the Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We achieved this robust performance by increasing the healthcare value we deliver to people every day, providing more affordable higher quality healthcare, while improving patient and care provider satisfaction.","As an innovative technology enabled healthcare company, the value we offer society is rising at an accelerating pace. In turn, we expect to continue to grow, serving more people in more ways across the U.S. and worldwide. Thank you for joining us. This concludes our call.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"21220":["UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) Q1 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call April 18, 2017  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Stephen Hemsley - CEO","Larry Renfro - CEO and Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group and CEO, Optum","Dave Wichmann - President","Austin Pittman - CEO, UnitedHealthcare Community & State Division","Dan Schumacher - CFO, UnitedHealthcare","Steve Nelson - CEO, UnitedHealthcare, Medicare & Retirement Division","Brian Thompson - CFO UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement","Tim Wicks - CFO of Optum","Dirk McMahon - EVP of Enterprise Operations","Andrew Hayek - SCA, Chairman and CEO","Eric Murphy - CEO of OptumInsight","Analysts","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Dave Wimbley - Jefferies","Josh Raskin - Barclays","Scott Sidell - Credit Suisse","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A.

P. Morgan","Operator","Good morning. And I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some introductory information.","This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.","A description of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the Company's Investor page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 18, 2017, which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the Company's Web site.","I would like now to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2017 begins with stronger than expected revenue growth, reflecting improved customer retention and broad based growth across UnitedHealth Group. This in turn was driven by our consistent focus on customer value, fundamental execution and net promoter scores.","We remain optimistic about 2017, and accordingly, we are modestly strengthening our revenue, earnings and cash flow outlooks. Considerable national attention over the past three months is focused on U. S. healthcare and tax policies, so we\u2019ll begin with some brief commentary there this morning.","We have engaged with elected officials from both parties, and at the federal and state levels, to address improving quality, access, affordability, cost and satisfaction for all stakeholders. Affordability can be improved most in the immediate term through lower taxes, and we hope Congress acts soon to permanently repeal the health insurance tax, before it further worsens consumers' premiums, state budgets and senior benefits. We have no insight as to whether that will or will not occur, and accordingly, our plans continue to assume the tax will return in 2018, which will raise premiums and\/or reduce benefits for commercial businesses, state and our nation's senior population.","In the longer-term, policy changes that improve healthcare and the health system play to our strength. UnitedHealthcare delivers modern, innovative, high performing network based health benefits with market leading capabilities and consumer engagement, value based reimbursement, network architecture and clinical management. We tailor these capabilities to address the needs of programs of every type and the consumers they serve.","Optum\u2019s customers seek better data and analytics to improve decision making in the doctor's office, in the ER and acute care settings, at points of consumer engagement and on payer and employer desktops. As an open market integrator, Optum uniquely serves across all payers and care providers. Optum's own comprehensive clinical care delivery services have a highly compelling quality and cost profile. And Optum offers pharmacy care that integrates with Medical Care to support a whole person's clinical experience.","This UnitedHealth Group portfolio is flexible, adaptable, innovative and positioned to contribute constructably to virtually any change agenda. We will continue to serve and grow through the changes that follow evolving social policy. A core part of that adaptability is, we continue to broaden and strengthen our leadership team by developing executive talent.","We routinely give proven leaders new challenges that deepen their experiences and skill-sets. UnitedHealth Group has a tradition of developing leaders in this way and doing so when our businesses are performing well, which is the best time for change.","In this day, we will highlight for you some of our most recent actions. UnitedHealthcare's executive leadership team has performed exceptionally well over the past few years. We have made a few changes to evolve that team; Steve Nelson will step forward as UnitedHealthcare's overall CEO and Dan Schumacher will serve as President; Brian Thompson, Medicare and Retirement's CFO for the last several years becomes its CEO.","This UnitedHealthcare leadership team, anchored by Jeff Alter, Austin Pittman, Dan and Steve for the last several years will continue to operate as one team. They are committed to accelerating UnitedHealthcare efforts to drive growth and deepen the quality and consistency of its performance and its relationships in serving all stakeholders.","Optum's performance over the last five years under Larry Renfro leadership has been nothing short of exceptional. And we are laying the groundwork for even higher performance levels. Larry is evolving Optum's leadership team as well with Dirk McMahon, a 14-year UnitedHealth Group veteran serving as Optum's Operating President; John Prince is leading OptumRx; Eric Murphy, Optum's longstanding Chief Growth Officer, has assumed leadership of OptumInsight. And we\u2019re pleased to have Andrew Hayek, who have joined us by way of the SCA merger, assuming overall leadership for OptumHealth.","Phil Miller has made the decision to spend less time on airplanes and more time with his family in Kansas City. And Mark Peer, who as CEO of OptumRx played a central role in leading the integration of OptumRx, has also decided to step back, take a well earned and deserved rest and pursue his own investment interests. We deeply appreciate their exceptional leadership in advancing Optum and the many contributions they have made.","We'll now begin our first quarter performance review with UnitedHealth Group Vice Chairman and Optum CEO, Larry Renfro. Larry?","Larry Renfro","Thank you, Steve. As you said, it\u2019s the right time to evolve our leadership team. Veteran leaders with new focus, new energies and high expectations working with a mission, from a platform like none other in healthcare. Across UnitedHealth Group, our team continues to deepen the disciplines of responsive service, consistent quality, innovation and relationship trust, all in the context of our mission and our culture.","We have meaningfully advanced the net promoter system, NPS, across UnitedHealth Group and fully aligned our compensation systems with annual and long-term NPS goals. This year's first surveys of consumer NPS at UnitedHealthcare showed scores rising 4 points in each of our commercial, Medicare and retirement and community and state businesses. And Optum's results show strong satisfaction as well.","The greatest value with this disciplines lies in the insights, NPS provides, enabling our people to design focused action plans to improve the consumer, client and care provider experience. Our enterprise-wide goal is ambitious. We are targeting a world class NPS of 70 within seven years, or 70 in seven. For us, NPS is both an operating and a growth metric, because our operational responses to customer needs increase trust, loyalty retention and reputation and these ultimately translate to growth. And our businesses are experiencing consistently higher customer retention.","We are becoming adept in relationship and pipeline development and management, with a laser focus on our five high growth market for the enterprise. Those markets are technology enabled information and services, clinical care delivery, pharmacy care services, consumer centric benefits and global opportunities. Alone, each one of these areas represents a substantial opportunity to serve. And combined, they drive the next decade of growth for UnitedHealth Group.","Turning to Optum's first quarter. We grew earnings from operations by $173 million year-over-year, a 16% earnings growth rate on revenue growth of $1.6 billion, virtually all organic. Operating margins expanded to 6% overall and earnings from operations grew year-over-year by double-digit percentages for each reporting segment. Strong first quarter operating metrics provide visibility into continued revenue growth in 2017. Compared to the first quarter of last year, OptumHealth grew to serve 6 million more people with average per capita revenues growing about 10%.","OptumRx fulfilled 15 million more scripts, an above market 5% growth rate. And OptumInsight\u2019s revenue backlog grew 19% or $2.1 billion in the past 12 months with more than $1.5 billion added in the first quarter. First quarter activity included the completion of our merger with Surgical Care Affiliates, a strategic addition to our OptumCare platform.","SCA and its strong leadership team, an outstanding workforce, move us one more step toward creating the next generation of healthcare delivery. Clinical care, i. e. community focused, high quality, consumer friendly and cost efficient. Today, we serve patients as an in-network care provider on behalf of more than 80 payers.","We offer urgent care at nearly 250 neighborhood care centers, primary care through local medical practices in nearly 30 markets with 22,000 dedicated physicians; house calls 1.3 million home visits this year performed by 1,700 skilled certified nurse practitioners; complex care management services, both in home and in nursing facilities; and now, high quality consumer and clinically differentiated surgeries in 33 states and more than 200 convenient free-standing surgical centers with top flight medical partners in local health communities.","When we align and integrate enriched patient level data and applied analytics with our own care delivery capabilities, we are better positioned to serve healthcare through more effective value based contracts on a multi-payer basis, and that holds true for those we partner with as well.","This effort, when fully scaled, yields more consistent health outcomes, lower cost and greater convenience for patients and the health system as a whole. This will continue to evolve as we advance and connect these practices and patients and integrate their pharmacy and other ambulatory and acute services. We are just in the beginning phases of this multi-year effort.","OptumRx was selected last month as a pharmacy care partnered by the Health Transformation Alliance, which represents Fortune 100 national employers. Proven OptimaRx capabilities in applying data and analytics to improve both pharmacy care and health care were important to earning new opportunity. We see the potential for multi-year growth through HTA, following a notable business award implemented in 2017 from several of the largest, most sophisticated customers in the market.","Our health financial services capabilities continue to drive growth across channels, products and platforms as well. The nation's second largest retirement plan administrator, Empower Retirement, named OptumHealth its exclusive partner for health savings accounts. Empower Health\u2019s people understand the direct connection between health and wealth, and is offering customers Optum\u2019s HSA\u2019s and digital tools to help retirees and active workers plan and save their future healthcare expenses.","These examples further illustrate how we serve effectively and strategically interconnected businesses with platform level capabilities. It has been over five years since we began one Optum, an effort that built a robust and growing first generation information and technology enabled health services platform. Many of you have tracked Optum success in bringing a differentiated approach to helping customers better solve their complex problems.","This year, our revenues are on pace to triple from 2011, and we are continuing efforts to align and integrate our businesses to position leadership, to build deeper relationships, and to focus on mission, culture and growth.","Today, we are driving a second generations one Optum effort, to position Optum to truly enable a better performing healthcare system from the local community to national and global levels. Our first quarter demonstrates we are on track to achieve the strong level of results in 2017 [audio gap] we have discussed with you, and we plan to enter 2018 with considerable momentum.","Now let me turn it over to Dave.","Dave Wichmann","Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare began the year with exceptional results. Outside the ACA individual market, the business grew to serve 2.5 million more people year-over-year and 1.5 million more people in the first three months of 2017. This continues a multi-year run of seven-figure membership growth. Performance that remains distinctive in the market year-after-year, an expectation we remain committed to for years to come.","Our commitment to improving consumer value in healthcare drives us to continually improve healthcare quality and lower healthcare cost. Medical cost remained well controlled, current year cost trends are running in line with our expectations.","As you are all aware the health insurance tax was deferrred in 2017, reducing premiums for customers in 2017 and adding about 150 basis points year-over-year to our consolidated Medical Care ratio. Absent this impact, our first quarter Medical Care ratio improved, mostly due to our significantly reduced participation in ACA individual offerings. Our consistent focus and innovation around medical cost performance and consumer experience continue to drive customer loyalty, leading to higher retention and strengthen growth. Let's look at growth by business and product, starting with employer and individual.","In commercial offerings, we grew to serve 480,000 more people in the first quarter, 225,000 through risk-based products and 255,000 through fee-based offerings. And as you are well aware, last year, we made the difficult decision to reposition our ACA individual offerings, given our views on the sustainability of that market segment. At the same time, we remained committed to working with states and federal policy-makers to find ways to offer these markets and the uninsured, more viable and sustainable health benefits.","The year began strongly in the public and senior sector as well, with the number of people served increasing by more than 1 million in total, including more than 300,000 people in Medicaid and 675,000 people in Medicare Advantage, about half of which were in employer retiree programs. Consumers are responding to our strong and consistent quality, distinctive star ratings, clinical engagement, stable premiums and benefits and the service experience our employees deliver.","Across the UnitedHealthcare, we are growing both through increased penetration and long-standing markets and through geographic expansion in Maricopa County, Arizona, in the Western slopes of Colorado and in Upstate New York, as examples.","Our clinical engagement has been increasingly differentiated as we care for a greater mix of members with higher care needs. The Dual Eligible Special Needs, or D-SNP market is a good example. The dually eligible make up just 15% of the total Medicaid population, but they account for roughly 35% of the total Medicaid spending. This demand on healthcare resources reveals the need to deliver highly coordinated and integrated health and social solutions that improve consistency of access and care, decrease the use of unnecessary services and high cost settings, and ultimately reduce costs without diluting care.","While these individuals\u2019 health needs are more complex, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. Only 2 million of the dually eligible are currently enrolled in Managed Care, while nearly 9 million remain largely unmanaged in state-based fee for services systems. So far in 2017, we have entered into five new state markets and we expect to serve nearly 100,000 more dually eligible people in total of this year.","UnitedHealthcare's core capabilities, aligned with serving individuals with complex needs, and helping them maintain their quality of life, which benefits the individuals, their families and the state and federal program sponsors tests with financing their care. By the end of this year, we expect to serve more than one quarter of the 2 million dual special need planned beneficiaries enrolled in Managed Care nationwide. We see D-SNP as a new and early stage market with great potential to grow by serving those with challenging needs.","Last, on the subject of growth. More broadly, and as a reminder, while we continue to see real opportunity for growth, we are disciplined and firm about participating only in those markets that remain sustainable and we\u2019ll make the tough decisions to exists unsustainable markets, as demonstrated by recent exchange actions and selective Medicaid exists in the past.","Taken as a whole, the UnitedHealthcare businesses grew revenues this quarter by $4.2 billion or 12% year-over-year to $40.1 billion. That is despite foregoing $1.6 billion in quarterly revenues or 5 percentage points of the year-over-year growth from the ACA insurance market withdrawals and the health insurance tax moratorium. Earnings from operations exceeded $2.1 billion in the quarter, growing 15% fully in line with our top line growth in the quarter.","Bringing the quarter together on a consolidated basis, UnitedHealth Group grew revenues of nearly $49 billion, grew 9.4%. Consolidated earnings from operations were $3.4 billion and our net earnings to shareholders grew 35% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS rose 31% to $2.37 per share.","Overall, we now expect 2017 revenues of approximately $200 billion and adjusted net earnings per share to be in a range from $9.65 to $9.85 per share. This is an increase of $0.30 per share from the midpoint of our outlook in January, partly from an improved tax rate in the area of 32.05% for the full year. The tax rate improvement is driven by a number of factors, about half of which are more discrete in nature, such as share based compensation and half, which we would expect to be more sustainable into the future.","We expect our full year fully diluted share count to be approximately 980 million shares and we have increased our expectations for cash flows from operation to approximately $12 billion this year. With these considerations, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be largely consistent with the first quarter earnings we reported this morning. Steve?","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you, Dave. So we remain positive and constructive with respect to our organization\u2019s potential to better serve the health and well being of individuals and improve the health system overall; fulfilling our mission to help people live healthier lives and to make the heath system work better for everyone. In fully responding to the market needs we see every day, we\u2019ll realize the remarkable potential of this enterprise. And as we do that with consistent excellence and confidence, we will continue to experience diversified, balanced and consistent growth as we\u2019ve seen today.","So thank you for your interest today and operator, let's turn to questions and again one question at a time. We\u2019ll try to get to all of them this morning.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Peter Costa","Thanks guys, lot of management changes there. Can you talk about if there is any reason why you're doing them now? And does it have anything to do with the selling season coming into 2018, going forward?","Stephen Hemsley","Peter, I don\u2019t really have anything to offer other than what we did. We develop and think about these changes in advance. We kind of evolve them in our organization. We do these things when things are really, I think in strong order. And I think our tradition has been to do these every two, between two years and three years. And we\u2019re excited about it, and I think it provides fresh new focus, a lot of energy. And we have a tremendous leadership team, great depth. So we have a lot of talent to choose from. And in many respects, we just, we move from one spot to another to broaden experience as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything more than we feel very comfortable taking these steps at this point in time.","Peter Costa","And then so you're anticipating the 2018 selling season to be similar to the past seasons, or how you\u2019re factoring out?","Stephen Hemsley","We think pretty positively about 2018, at some challenges with respect to the health insurance tax as it sits right now. But as a total enterprise and our opportunities, I think you can see momentum growing in our business here for the last couple of years. And we expect that to carry through into 2018. So we do expect strong '18.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Wimbley with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Dave Wimbley","My question is a follow up on the last, which is on health insurer fee. By what point would you need to know whether that moratorium will be extended or if it'll be permanently eliminated in order to price appropriately for 2018 or has that date already passed? And if the health insurer fee is reinstated for 2018, what impact would you expect that to have on growth and Medicare Advantage? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. So we'll parse those questions up. I think Dan will talk about...","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Good morning Dave. Obviously, from our perspective, we have been long supporters of the permanent repeal of the health insurers\u2019 tax. At the end of the day, obviously, it just increases the cost of healthcare, makes it less affordable and compromises people's ability to gain coverage. So we are certainly advocating along those lines. As we think about the tax itself, obviously, we\u2019ve got to deal with it as it sits currently in loss, and so that's what we're doing. We're planning accordingly. We're incorporating it in pricing and also incorporating in our thinking as we plan our benefits in Medicare.","In terms of timing, there's different timings based on the businesses. So obviously small business, starts to resolve itself clearly now and into May, for next year large group takes later in the commercial process. And then as you look at the Medicare business that first Monday and in June is when we're doing our filing. So as it sits right now, we will plan accordingly and incorporate it. And as you think about, if it were repealed, obviously, we talked about the benefit of the moratorium in 2017 and size that in the $0.25 EPS range. Obviously, when it went out versus when it would come back in, the size of that, if it were to stay, is about a 30% increase in the tax itself. And then obviously, we've done well to grow market share over that time. So you can expect that, if the tax comes back in, it would come back in at a greater impact than what we talked about for '17. I think that covers it.","Dave Wimbley","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Josh Raskin","My question just on a retail presence and I'm just curious. Do you think UnitedHealth Group, overall, would benefit from a larger retail footprint beyond just urgent care centres? And where did that stack up on your list of priorities in terms of capital deployment and what you want to do?","Stephen Hemsley","Interesting question, I think we're actually gaining market presence through OptumCare and through -- and that growing portfolio. And I think you probably not talk much about this. But we've also tried to increase our community presence in our UnitedHealthcare benefits in terms of we do offer some store front, kiosks. So that is a coming trend, but I think we'll take that in a measured way. And I think the other thing Josh to think about is your digital presence, if you think about it, whether retail is or physical presence is as strategic today as digital presence might be.","And we've obviously taken some really powerful steps in terms of developing digital capabilities through the rally platform and our other applications. So we kind of are moving out in both those directions and we'll take it in a measured way and make sure that we're staging into the marketplace in that presence thoughtfully. Beyond it, I don't think I can offer too much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Sidell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Scott Sidell","I had a question, just if you can talk about how your caulking out the final MA rates for 2018, and any swing factors that you saw, whether that was pretty straightforward. And then just also, separately just related to MA, maybe just give us an update on how the claims experience seems to be tracking so far in MA book, particularly in terms of the new members that you\u2019ve added so far this year? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure, and I think the benefits obviously will be more measured because that is more strategic, et cetera. But, Brian, you want to respond?","Brian Thompson","Sure, thank you. Good morning, Scott. With respect to the rates, we do continue to be concerned about the underfunding of the MA program. I think this is now 13% in cuts, since 2010. The final rates, where I believe 45 basis points of improvement year-over-year to the industry still in positive territory, but less than what we did experienced a year ago. I do believe though our starts advance in 2018 will help us relative to the industry, and will help us as we continue to navigate through this funding environment to provide, what is our number one priority is around benefit stability or underlying members.","As we think about the growth that we\u2019re experiencing, we\u2019re three months in. And what we\u2019re seeing is aligning to our expectations, both in terms of mix and cost profiles, and we are very pleased with our industry leading growth. As you know about half of that growth is coming from our group business with the balance inside our individual. And I can't emphasize enough the role retention has played. I believe this is the third consecutive year where we\u2019ll be breaking our own performance records on member attention. And that is the biggest driver of our individual growth this year over last.","And as Dave mentioned at the outset, the themes are the same as a year ago; stability in our offerings, in our network; the advancements we\u2019ve shown in our quality, as evidenced with our stars; continued improvement in engagement and satisfaction with our house calls. And when you wrap it all up, we\u2019re certainly pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. And I think this growth is a positive validation of the priorities we\u2019ve been focused on.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Kevin Fischbeck","I just want to go, I guess to Larry's comments about the momentum, heading into 2018 in Optum. Because I guess, we look at this year Q1 Optum growth for all three businesses was less, and the annual number for 2016, I think, 2016 for all three businesses was less than what we saw in 2015. So when you talk about momentum into next year, obviously, the absolute growth rates are still pretty strong, but it's been decelerating over the last couple of years. When you talk about momentum in 2018, are we talking about consisting growth, reaccelerating growth? How do we think about that context and of those businesses, which business do you feel most confident about, seeing that momentum into 2018?","Stephen Hemsley","I\u2019ll let Larry take that. But I think the growth is actually across optimism has been pretty impressive. And each year, they drive bigger numbers, so they\u2019re growing off a bigger platform. And I think people lose sight of the share size and scale of Optum. But Larry you can handle it yourself.","Larry Renfro","Sure. So Kevin, I guess, the way that I would -- let me approach it a couple of different ways. We have put together, obviously, our plans in terms of how we attack the market for the first five years and we\u2019re in the process as we talked about early that we are developing a second generation plan that we\u2019re going forward with right now. When we are looking at sales and we\u2019re looking at growth, we look at certain factors as an organization and pretty much everybody in Optum operates off of these factors; number one, would be the backlog that we talked about being about $2.1 billion year-over-year.","We talked about, I guess we didn\u2019t get into what we look at in terms of our sales pipeline that finished 2016 at about $30 billion and that was up from 2015 at about $10 billion. And then you look at our overall sales in terms of the TCV and that was probably what I just said, the $10 billion to the $30 billion in sales and the overall pipeline would be about $30 billion. So that\u2019s been tremendous growth in terms of how we look at it. Now, if we look at the first quarter of 2017, I don\u2019t want to go into the numbers. But I would tell you, it\u2019s a record quarter in terms of overall sales. Some of the factors that might enter into this, in terms of overall revenue that might make think something that might be a little bit different is that we, as we -- if you just look at Catamaran or you look at what we\u2019re doing in OptumRx.","We are absolutely having scale and efficiency that\u2019s driving a better customer -- totally driving better customer value. And as a result of that, some of those numbers might look a different. And I'm going to ask Tim to talk a little bit about that in a second. But I think that, as we look into 2018, we think that we\u2019re very well positioned. We think that we are on target with all of our expectations. We have the five growth areas that we\u2019re focused on; the government services; what we\u2019re doing in OptumCare; what we\u2019re doing with Pharmacy Care services; technology services, as well as international. So we feel very, very downhill about 2018. So Tim may be comment a little bit on the OptumRx side.","Tim Wicks","Thanks, Larry. Kevin, Tim Wicks, CFO of Optum, just wanted to follow on with what Larry talked about in terms of the integration efforts at OptumRx. I think one of the things that\u2019s really important to understand is that as we continue to drive progress and our integration efforts are deepening, this is really translating into lower drug cost for consumers and customers. And it\u2019s really a key part of the helping us drive earnings growth performance year-over-year. And our expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress around the levers that we\u2019re driving around the integration efforts that Larry referenced.","Operator","We'll take our next question from A. J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","A. J. Rice","Maybe I'll just ask a broad question around the evolving landscape and wash on your thoughts on that. We\u2019re not really sure where the ACA revealing or replace is at this point. But some of the things have been discussed are such as easing up on the essential benefit package, given more flexibility with respect to the rating span, shifting more discretion overall for healthcare to the states. I wonder do you guys have a strong view on that. And also ask if we do pivot to tax policy, are there any -- obviously a lot of domestic earnings, almost all domestic earnings you have would assume you would be a beneficiary. But is there any nuances around that we should think about? And then finally on the regulatory, the CMS has asked the industry to offer up suggestions on the regulatory front. Is there anything that either you or the industry would highlight on that score?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure, A.J. I would -- it's probably not often that we say this. But if you really actually have been following the media with respect to the activities, with respect to healthcare policy, I would say that the media has been very accurate with respect to the narrative that is going on there, and the elements, many of which you suggest. So I think if you were following the media, generally speaking, you'd be up to speed. And we couldn\u2019t probably offer anymore insights than that.","In our prepared remarks, we obviously focused on the health insurance tax. Because that, as Dan said, is going into the marketplace now for 2018. And that has an impact on affordability and the uptake of the participation in those markets. So we are strong advocate of repealing that and to taking that action as quickly as possible. Beyond that, we have engaged. We think pretty constructively around the notion of, and I think you can see this in our published materials on our Web site, that we see actually a marketplace that could be pretty constructive. But based upon more orientation to state based markets, more flexibility in the marketplace, really seeing Medicaid as the programs that have grown in effectiveness and to become broadly recognized as actually very efficient healthcare coverage for the populations to which they apply.","And the elements that you mentioned the flexibility with respect to underwriting activities and so forth, we think those all would be covered in what we would see as more flexible state based markets that are actually more under the control of those that are close to the market in the state. I think all those things are really in conversation, but I think it's really around what is politically possible, maybe in contrast to what might be the most effective policies that could be applied.","I would say that the tone has been generally more positive and access has been more available. So there is little bit more of a constructive posture. And so we remain hopeful that as this policy evolves that it could be better for coverage for American people, and return to the innovation and flexibility of the marketplace. And we think healthcare will benefit from that. Corporate tax, I think broadly will benefit, broadly across America in terms of economics, in terms of Company's outlooks. And in our sector we'd be similar to that.","We have high effective tax rate and we think that tax reform at the corporate level will be good for consumers. It will play back into their benefit. We think it'll be good for employment levels. And we would obviously benefit from that and it will be good in terms of just the overall level of resource that we dedicate to at the corporate tax line. So we would be an advocate of thoughtful tax reform, and I think the majority of American industry would.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Sarah James","If I look at the Medicaid RFP platform for the next two or three years, it has a good amount of rebids as opposed to new contracts. And if I think further out, a lot of the new opportunity is in the higher acuity population. So how do you think about the influence of competitive rebids and a shift to higher acuity populations on the long term margin profile of your Medicaid book? And what do you see as the organic growth profile of Medicaid? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","I actually think both will be \u2013 both of positive trends, Austin?","Austin Pittman","So first and foremost, the RFP pipeline remain strong, you hit it while there is both new populations coming into Medicaid; there're new geographies being expanded within existing states; and there're greenfield states that are looking to continue to move. I think it's just a measure of the continued value year-after-year that Medicaid has provided to consumers and to our state partners. So we don't see a slowdown in that movement. The movement in populations with more complex needs, and I think Dave actually touched on this in his opening comments, really plays to the core capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum both. When you combine the data analytics capability, the clinical insights, the local delivery mechanisms that we've now got in place, combining physical, behavioral and social needs, we really feel like we've established a real foothold in serving populations.","We\u2019re very pleased with the response we've gotten from consumers in the D-SNP category that Dave spoke to. We've seen the consumer experience continue to improve. We've got NPS now over 74, so just really outstanding. We're not going to rest on that, we're going to continue to learn to serve these populations better and better. And you're right. We think that'll continue to be an area of significant growth that plays to our strengths.","With regards to the earnings profile, like all of our government programs, we expect that to be in the 3% to 5% margin range. And certainly, we\u2019ll be on a higher revenue base. So when you look at the membership growth, you'll have to adjust for the type of members those are because those more complex needs members do drive higher revenue.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Justin Lake","My question is broadly around the UHC business, just given the strength here, curious if you can give us some directional color at least in terms of how the segments within that business were performing in terms of margin and profitability. And then Dan, your comments on the health insurer fee are really helpful, a lot of questions here. So just hoping maybe you could take that one last step further and help us put a range around the EPS headwind it would present in 2018 if it's not repealed versus the $0.25 tailwind that it\u2019s adding this year? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Dan, you want to pick up where you left off.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Good morning, Justin. I appreciate the temp on the health insurers\u2019 fee. I think we'll leave specific sizing to that for our investor conference and also obviously a better understanding of what the actual law will be as we step into 2018. As it relates to your question around the UHC businesses, as Dave mentioned in the prepared remarks we were able to drive 12% revenue growth rate across the platform. And if you adjust for the impacts of health insurers\u2019 fee and the individual ACA, the reduction in our footprint there, we drove closer to about 17% growth rate in our UnitedHealthcare business. And as you underneath that, we had really nice growth in every one of our business platforms. And the driver of that revenue growth that we\u2019re seeing pull through to our earnings base is really the enrollment expansions.","And as you look at each of our business platforms it\u2019s happening in the places that frankly we have an opportunity to deliver greater value and greater returns. So as you look at the commercial business, we\u2019re growing nicely inside that group commercial fully insured business in Medicare and in Medicare Advantage. And in Medicaid, orienting towards, as Austin just talked about, more complex and more vulnerable populations, all which have more revenue content and likewise have strong earnings potential for us as a business. So on balance very strong medical cost well controlled and very much in keeping with our expectations. So we\u2019re pleased with the first quarter favorable mix.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ralph Jacoby","Just want to go back to last question, specifically on the UnitedHealthcare margins, 5.3% this quarter. You ended last year around those levels. I guess what we\u2019re looking for is maybe a sense of where margins currently fit across the mark deal each end market at this point, where you still see room for expansion. Obviously, understanding that population should shifts are going to impact that. But just want to understand where there still is upside for margin expansion in each of the end market? Thanks.","Dan Schumacher","Ralph, this is Dan again. As far as the end markets and the margins, obviously, we\u2019ve guided to and talked about government based margins in the 3% to 5% range and across their Medicare and Medicaid portfolios that we\u2019re operating within those ranges. And we obviously endeavour to perform towards the high end of that range. And on the commercial business, we\u2019re in the mid to upper single digits, and performing well in that business. And as we think about margin expansion or [audio gap], I would say earnings growth more specifically, we\u2019re looking to orient drive our earnings growth more from volume, so continuing to serve more consumers across our broad and diversified platform. And where there is opportunity, we\u2019ll look to expand margins as well, but feeling good about our positioning in each of our businesses. And better and better Medical Care management, no doubt but commercial and Medicare being strongest and probably Medicaid follow that.","Operator","We will take our next question from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Chris Rigg","I wanted to see if you can provide anymore color around the goals and net promoter score. First, can you just give us the basis, I know you said a four point improvement across the three segments, so where you are today? And then more importantly for investors, and we think 70 and seven years, what does that mean for capital deployment priorities? And is it sort of you are looking -- need to look externally to buy capabilities or is it more about just putting money back into what you already have? Thanks.","Larry Renfro","That\u2019s a great question, and half a day on. But Dave you want to take that this morning?","Dave Wichmann","Thanks Chris, great question, I appreciate it. As Larry stated, we\u2019ve meaningfully advanced our MPS disciplines in the business, I would say, over call it about two years now or so. And as he also indicated, we\u2019ve now fully aligned it to our compensation systems, which should give you some senses as to how we feel about the integrity of the data that we\u2019re receiving and also the ability of our organization to actually influence these results.","Both businesses have shown very meaningful progress, and that\u2019s across the consumer client and care provider scores as well. So we do look at this in a multi-dimensional way. We generate a wide range of performance across our business. We, like anything we measure this over a multiple different sales in our business, and our performance does range out quite widely, which is one of the objectives that we have over this time period which is to get to more consistency, which will lead to a greater support of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum and other brands across our business overall. We gave you an expectation of 70 and seven years, and it\u2019s unlike to actually think and report out on a seven year basis.","We\u2019re basically telling you the same things that we\u2019ve engaged our employees around, which is to have and seek to meaningfully improve our performance across multiple dimensions in our business. And that\u2019s exactly what they do they do this by analyzing why people promote our products, why there are detractors and our products. That deep analytic and then the action plans are developed around that are what really provide the substance to this program. And the achievement as measured is critical and important. And we just called out the achievements of UnitedHealthcare this morning, we could easily -- we\u2019ve done the same for Optum. But they have improved just so far in this first quarter alone by 4 points, which all the NPS statisticians out there would suggest that is a meaningful and statistical improvement year-over-year.","So while this 70 is an aggregated number it does mark a plan of achievement over the course of the seven years towards a greater satisfaction and a greater a reference point of consumers, clients and care providers of our business. And I\u2019d suggest you that\u2019s on a baseline of about 40 or so today, which is a meaningful score, meaningful place. But honestly what we\u2019re trying to do is to reorient what our expectations are around satisfactory service and performance broadly as an organization.","In terms of capital deployment, it\u2019s already found its way into the way in which we operate our call centres, how we process claims, how we handle adjustments and call backs from consumers and how we engage with the market base broadly. I wouldn\u2019t see this as something that\u2019s going to be capital intensive. It is something that just shapes the way in which we spend our CapEx annually. And likely will result in additional investment across the business.","Again, our goal here is to create a higher NPS, which drives greater trust with the marketplace, trust to get loyalty, loyalty to get drove. And you're starting to see that shape up in the retention across our business. Retention is important, it gets us greater predictability in our business, overall, but it also provides a great launching pad for growth into the future.","Chris Rigg","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Larry Renfro","I think it comes down to how we spend that capital, and doing it effectively. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a more capital issue it will give us insight to how we spend it more effectively. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Lance Wilkes","Just wanted to ask a little bit about the TVM growth outlook and in particular for OptumRx, what is the composition of clients looking like, going forward. How much do you think you're going to be able to improve on penetration in your UHC self insurer block there. And what's the outlook for margin profile is that evolves, going forward?","Stephen Hemsley","Maybe Dirk, you want to start that out and then John Prince.","Dirk McMahon","I would say that we talked a little bit about the 2016 momentum that we had sold to some fairly sophisticated buyers throughout 2016. And in the script we also talked about the Healthcare Transformational Alliance. And again, we were chosen as a partner for that group. So from that perspective, I think our value proposition is resonating with the sophisticated buyer population. I would say in answer to your question about how we would further penetrate within UnitedHealthcare, I think it just goes back to our synchronization value story; our ability to take in the medical data, the pharmacy data; take that in with our next best action protocols and have our call service agents, get people disease management and clinical management program. So I think from the value proposition standpoint that will drive with UnitedHealthcare. More broadly about the market, I turn over to John to talk about what we\u2019re seeing in issuer selling season.","John Prince","Thanks Dirk. Good morning, Lance. This is John Price, CEO of OptumRx. In terms of 2018, we\u2019re still in the early in the season. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s chasing up to be a very robust season compared to last year. Our differentiated offering is really resonating in the market in terms of the things starting. Our pipeline is very similar to last year includes large government, labor, payer and employer bids. So it\u2019s a very robust market in terms of the diversity. There is also a lot of large strategic opportunities, which are in line with our expectations. The RFP volume is as well as the mix of clients is as expect in terms of expectations. So I think this is shaping up to be a very solid year.","In terms of pricing competition, pricing remains robust in the market but disciplined. So we're also excited about that. And also very excited about how the market is responding to our solution similar to last year, our differentiated offerings in terms of things, focusing on managing drug cost as well as the total cost of healthcare is really resonating in the market. In terms of Lance your last session with the margin, our margin expectations haven't changed. We're still expecting 3% to 5% long term outlook for the market.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Michael Baker","My question's for Dirk. Given the fact that you're headed back to Optum in a more elevated role. Could you give us a sense of your top three priorities?","Dirk McMahon","Well, I think to start off with my first one is to make UnitedHealthcare and Optum work better together, that will be number one. I think I have a good perspective of what works from a value creation standpoint and works from a customer standpoint across both business platforms. And I would start with that. I would add on to, from an NPS perspective, Dave mentioned that. NPS is very important. Pharmacy care services is a huge -- is the most heavily used benefit within the healthcare space. I think making sure that that operates well is important, we really gotten off to a good start there.","And I would also say making sure that with respect to some of the integration that we have and it\u2019s still continuing, I would say that that's another area where it would be a high priority for me. And last thing I would say is from a technology standpoint, Optum technology making sure that we deliver on the technology is needed across the enterprise on behalf of our customers. One of the big things is simplification from a technology standpoint, from an NPS standpoint. And what I would say is that's a good place to focus as well.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Cheryl Connick with Mizuho. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Cheryl Connick","I had been wondering when the management shift or rotation would occur, it seems like it was a long time. So nice to see the Company is strong enough to be able to do that at this time, and do it so easily with some of the folks. The question that I have though is if we could, and I almost take assets Managed Care question, but I will. If we could dig down into the cost trend a little bit, you usually give us a breakdown in how much you see in utilization of in-patient versus out-patient, perhaps pharmacy trend. But if we can think about this from a value based perspective, what if anything, are you seeing in any differences over time in the composition of your cost trend. And if you can step back and analyze that a little bit. Now that you're in the care provider business, pretty strongly with OptumCare on the one side, and certainly your network construction on the other. What should we be thinking about those shifts? And how we might see the composition of the cost trend changing over time even if the level stays relatively constant?","Stephen Hemsley","I'll start out with a few themes and then ask my colleagues on the UnitedHealthcare side to pick it up. But I guess Cheryl a good question and a thoughtful one. We have been seeing a pretty steady movement of services into, and I'll say, the out-patient setting, are out to the community. And we have been following them with the OptumCare platform and encouraging that. And thinking that that is a more ideal setting in which to engage and do those services. And we actually think the care technology is facilitating that. It is the procedures are getting simpler and more advanced, the rehabilitation processes, the care processes and so forth, all play to that. Also I think we've been pretty consistent about suggesting that we've seen more in terms of specialty pharma application, diagnostic testing; and those have been more of the trends in the acute care setting has been.","And I would say that we're pretty hopeful and optimistic that better, let's say, a better formulation or application of resources in the community setting holds a lot of benefit, particularly whereas consumers are becoming more knowledgeable, more information is available to them and they're being more engaged in picking the right settings for the services they need. Dan, you want to pick up on that.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Thanks, Steve. In addition to, I think what you did well to describe is some of that shift from the acute care setting to ambulatory settings, and that shift that comes from in-patient to out-patient. I think the other place Cheryl that I would point to is a greater investment around physician; so really them at the centre of the care continuum and making investments, and really connecting care in a whole-person way and investing in primary care, in particular. So as we think about the composition of where our spend is going, we do see shifts from in-patient to out-patient, a greater investment towards physician and then obviously some of the comments that Steve made with regard to pharmacy inside it.","Stephen Hemsley","And maybe Andrew, you have some perspectives, new voice and fresh perspective on that?","Andrew Hayek","I would echo what's been said. We do see across OptumCare, which of course include SCA and also our neighbourhood care centres. And medical groups, the Option D for more care to occur in the out-patient setting, improving the experience, quality and cost to healthcare, and improving the provider experience. So we're excited about what we see in the opportunity ahead.","Stephen Hemsley","And we\u2019re seeing the consumer more comfortable coming into these venues, and that\u2019s also really encouraging thing, so great question and we\u2019ll continue to focus on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ana Gupte","I wanted to get some more color more broadly on your Optum margin outlook, and your targets and appointment time. You\u2019ve seen some margin expansion this quarter and Insight and in Rx, not in Health. Do you still have, as a priority, a stretch goal with margin expansion you used to have one before Catamaran? And where is the most leverage in the model, by segment, is it in OptumCare and OptumHealth, or Insight or elsewhere?","Larry Renfro","We do, and I think Larry alluded to that in terms of revisiting one Optum. And I am going to ask Tim to comment on this. But going back to I think what you were talking about the model we had what something called one point time it was 15 by 15 and it was 8 by 16. And what's Steve\u2019s alluding to we\u2019ve played that those two through. And now we\u2019re in the process of putting together a new five year business plan that we\u2019re calling the second generation. And so there will be an emphasis on a lot of different things. But margin will be part of that. So I'll ask Tim to comment on that.","Tim Wicks","A couple of things to consider, as Larry mentioned about the energy that we\u2019re putting around second generation of one Optum; there is a significant amount work around and ensuring that we\u2019re investing in the areas where we see growth opportunities to be able to drive sustainable growth in the future. And I think it's important to consider that we make investments in our businesses, really focused around our ability to grow and that confidence in the growth in those areas.","I\u2019d say a great example of that is revenue at OptumHealth in the first quarter grew 18% year-over-year. And OptumHealth earnings grew 11%, while we made strategic investments across the platform, including Medicare deliveries significant growth in house call care capacity and implementing new behavioural clients. And as Larry alluded to as we think about the diverse portfolio across Optum, including margin expansion in Insight and Rx, we expanded overall Optum margin by 40 basis points while making the investments that I just described in OptumHealth; so that we think about it as a pretty seamless approach to driving investments in the businesses where we see growth and being able to drive overall earnings growth as well broadly across Optum. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Mike Newshel","Can you give us an update on M&A and new contracts internationally, looks like you just got regulatory approval for another small provider acquisition in Brazil and there are potentially some more assets there for sale. Are you looking to do more deals, and what's your focus in terms of provider versus insurance assets? And second is there any update on international opportunities on the Optum side as well, and UK in particular? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. We\u2019ll start with Dave.","Dave Wichmann","Sure. Thank you, Mike, it\u2019s a good question. As you have noted, we have been somewhat active in Brazil and we have been over the five year duration that we\u2019ve owned Amil, which we now refer to as UnitedHealth Group Brazil; constituting Amil the benefits business, Americas Servicos Medicos which is our healthcare delivery business and then Optum as an emerging services business there as well.","We of course have and we\u2019re very curious about M&A broadly across our business. As you know, we don\u2019t comment specifically on individual targets, but we do see broadly across our business M&A as a way to continue to invest the very strong cash flows of this enterprise. And I would suggest you that our interest are primarily in the Optum services markets, as you see us, particularly investing in OptumCare. And then we do have interest in select very thoughtful capital deployment and international markets, as well as some plug-in work that we'll continue to do at UnitedHealthcare overall. So, that\u2019s what I would suggest you our priorities.","Mike Newshel","Okay, thank you.","Larry Renfro","This is Larry. I'll comment on Optum, and what we\u2019re doing in the UK. So it's something that would just relate to in the United States we always talked about 75 market strategy. If you are in the UK, we would talk about a 44 market strategy. And they have developed a mechanism that they call strategic transformation plan. And they have linked together their trust and their trust would equal their hospitals. And so they have multiple hospitals that are in these SPPs as they call them. So in February, early February, we won our first business first step of a process with one of those SPPs. And that\u2019s where you're going to manage with an ACO process, and we do have physician groups.","And so we\u2019re tying in everything we do in the states into that win that we just received. Now, it\u2019s a first phase of it, we have about two more that are very, very close to have an a decision on. And doing that, we strengthen the leadership then we\u2019ve moved to a couple of people over so on and in order to manage this the way that we\u2019ll need to manage this, going forward. I would say that we\u2019re still in a situation, nationally. I look at the -- those 44 SPP is more local markets. But nationally, there are various things going on with data and information and digital that we are actually working with them very, very closely right now as well.","I know in the May timeframe we\u2019ll have a showcase where we\u2019ll showcase all of our technologies, as well as we\u2019ll have the Secretary of Health visiting us here in the States as well as a subset of the NHS board visiting us here in the states in the May timeframe. So things seem to be breaking a lose right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Christine Arnold","Let's ask about OptumCare and SCA. How much overlap was there between the locations where you've got primary care and your urgent care with SCA? And where are we in terms of innings in terms of building out OptumCare, do we feel that we need more specialists? How do we think about the progression of that business and how do we measure it overtime?","Andrew Hayek","This is Andrew. Appreciate the question. So in terms of overlap with the SCA and OptumCare markets, about 17 of the current OptumCare, primary care markets overlap with where SCA is. And SCA adds another about 17 markets that OptumCare positions are not in that are material MSAs. In terms of the mix of primary and specialist, we do see opportunities to leverage the presence we have with primary care. It\u2019s the relationships and brings more of the SCA model in to the benefit experience cost and the quality of care, which obviously helps the primary care groups and also helps our health payers and health system partners. So we do see opportunity to expand the model and be inclusive of more specialists, which we think inners to the benefit of the patients and the healthcare system.","Christine Arnold","And when will it take to build this out?","Andrew Hayek","Well, I\u2019d say that\u2019s multiyear. Christine, you remember we\u2019ve talked about this in let\u2019s say 75 markets is a first priority. And while we have a presence in many of those markets that presents isn\u2019t complete where we really have the the entire model represented in that marketplace where that model has been fully integrated. So I would say we continue to be in the very early stages of what our ambitions might be around OptumCare.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Gary Taylor with J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Gary Taylor","Just had one, fairly precise question. I was wondering when we look at OptumInsight. What percentage of the total revenues or Medicare Advantage risk coding services, what percentage of its net external sales would be in a risk coding services? And has there been any impact on the trajectory of sales given some of the recent legal scrutiny?","Stephen Hemsley","I'm not aware of any change in that, and it's not really that significant. Do we have an answer to that?","Eric Murphy","This is Eric Murphy, CEO of OptumIsight. We haven't seen any impact in terms of changes to both our existing business, as well as the strength of our pipeline. And I think we're in a very-very favourable position in that side of the market, just given the comprehensive nature of the capabilities that we bring to the marketplace with the integration of both risk and quality.","Stephen Hemsley","And it's not that big a line up of offering relative to the total of Optum. I don\u2019t know if we can size that, but it's just not that large, the product line.","So, thank you. Thanks for your questions this morning. And we hope the discussion has given you a sense of the optimism we have for 2017-2018, and beyond. As I think you can see our businesses are growing and we're providing increasingly differentiated value to a more diverse set of markets than others, and we're building deeper relationships with customers, consumers. And I think most importantly improving the healthcare experience essentially for all stakeholders, and I think that's how we'll continue to grow over the next decade, So thank you and we'll see you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information: This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports and SEC Filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 18, 2013, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our strong start to 2013 and update you in broad terms on the environment we expect for the balance of this year and into 2014.","As you could see from our release this morning, first quarter revenues grew more than 11% to reach $30.3 billion. We continue to grow market share and increase the number of customers and consumers we serve across every one of our businesses that make up the 2 core platforms of UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Our results reflect the consistent combination of fair and steady pricing disciplines, fresh innovation in our products and approaches, the capacity to address the changing needs of many of the key health care markets with comprehensive and integrated solutions and the fundamental values of consistent, responsive and compassionate service in everything we do. These elements all play to the steady top line growth we have been fortunate to realize this year and over the past 3-plus years as UnitedHealthcare has added a net 5 million U.S. consumers, virtually all organically, over that challenging economic period, and Optum has emerged as the distinctive enabling platform for advancing change across the health care system.","First quarter net earnings were $1.16 per share and were driven in particular by stronger earnings from Optum. Cash flows from operations for the quarter of $1.1 billion represented 85% of net income, a 9 percentage point improvement from the first quarter last year. Our balance sheet remains strong with $3 billion free cash and quarter ending debt-to-capital ratio of 36%. We repurchased more than $0.5 billion in shares for the quarter, consistent with our annual plan; paid $216 million in dividends, a 29% increase year-over-year; and our return on equity for the quarter was about 15%.","Turning to UnitedHealthcare. In the commercial markets, we worked closely with one of the largest fully insured customers in the nation to convert its coverage arrangements from risk to fee status. While the bottom line impact of this conversion is negligible, revenues are impacted significantly in this business by $2.5 billion annually.","Looking through this jumbo 1.1 million-member conversion, our organic consumer growth is pacing ahead of our plan for the year with first quarter commercial membership growing 375,000 overall, self-funded benefits up 480,000 people and risk-based benefits down a better-than-expected 105,000.","Commercial pricing yields are tracking well with our expectations, and the commercial care ratio for UnitedHealthcare came in at a solid 78.3% for the quarter. We are lowering our full year commercial medical care ratio target by 80 basis points from 82% to 81.2%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in large part, to reflect the large case funding conversion.","Growth across our Medicare offerings was even stronger. We added a net 300,000 seniors to Medicare Advantage, 145,000 to Medicare supplemental benefits and 485,000 to standalone Part D drug benefits. As expected, Medicare & Retirement margins were down in the first quarter given the Medicare ACA rate reductions, the shift of our traditional level of first quarter Part D profits to later in the year with the introduction of our enhanced plan design, the strong level of new growth in Medicare Advantage and, significantly, from unusually high levels of reserve development in the first quarter of 2012, which we were never expected to repeat in '13. And sequestration will now add further margin pressure over the balance of the year.","In Medicaid, we grew a net 65,000 people, representing organic growth of 125,000 offset by a divestiture impacting 60,000 beneficiaries, and we see no end to the growth opportunities. We've been privileged to expand services in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Florida. We look forward to the significant opportunities to grow and serve additional states and to seek further in-state expansions, as the Medicaid proposal pipeline remains robust.","And lastly, we are pleased with the very strong growth of more than 200,000 commercial lives at Amil in the first quarter.","In all of these broad categories, Commercial, Medicare, Part D, Medicaid and International, we are trending to the high end or above our growth outlook for 2013.","Looking at UnitedHealthcare on an all-in basis. The first quarter operating margin of 5.8% was well within the range of our expectations. As we also expected, reserve development levels of $280 million for the quarter were sharply less than the unusually high $530 million in development in the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2012 also benefited from a care ratio rebate true-up of $130 million.","First quarter 2013 saw greater positive development in the commercial business than in the government-sponsored program, but overall, our cost estimates are proving to be quite accurate. Operating cost management across UnitedHealthcare continues to be a strength even as we continue to spend to meet the extensive requirements of the new health care regulations.","Turning to Optum, the growth pace accelerates further. First quarter earnings from operations nearly doubled. Revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, a nearly 15% year-over-year top line growth performance. Every Optum segment grew organically and benefited from the continuing efforts to integrate and simplify the organization, focus on the customer and pivot to growth. Revenue growth was exceptional with OptumHealth growing revenues 26% to $2.4 billion, OptumInsight growing 15% to revenues of $773 million, and OptumRx growing 10% to revenues of $5.2 billion.","For Optum, margin restoration and expansion was an area of intense focus in 2012, and it remains so. The progress has been impressive with Optum's operating margin at 5.9% for the quarter compared to 3.4% for the prior year quarter and with each of Optum's businesses meaningfully strengthening its margins.","OptumHealth doubled its margins from 4.7% to 9.3% for the quarter, OptumInsight advanced from 13.3% to 19.3% first quarter margin, and OptumRx expanded from 1.5% to a 2.3% margin even with continuing costs associated with the significant current year in-sourcing efforts.","The market needs and is looking for the enabling capabilities Optum offers. We anticipate further client developments in coming quarters will illustrate just how strongly Optum is maturing, holding its focus on execution and customer service and pivoting to growth.","As we assess our position and our outlook, now informed by the events and perspectives of the first quarter, we remain in a strong overall position with our unique diversified businesses growing and performing well. That's in large part because we are serving customers well, we're steadily advancing our agenda of value and innovation and strengthening and readying our businesses to both navigate the coming market changes and then maximize the market opportunities with the right timing.","As we move beyond the successful TRICARE implementations and migrations of more than 12 million consumers to the OptumRx platform, we will redeploy energies and resources to advance new areas. The early themes of these new areas have been discussed with you before. They include: the comprehensive \"New Basics\" services model; a deep and substantive commitment to the rising importance of the consumer in health care; repeatable innovation disciplines and capability; deeper service and experience integration using simpler enabling technologies; and the acceleration of One Optum.","The businesses themselves are positioned to grow and perform well in service to their markets. UnitedHealthcare businesses are growing well across the board. Customer retention remain strong, and the new Military & Veterans platform is in place and operational. 2.9 million people from military families joined us on April 1.","In relation to the exchange markets that will begin in 2014, our views from last quarter remain unchanged. We will be very selective in where we participate and do not believe the exchanges will be a significant factor for us, either plus or minus, in our 2014 commercial market outlook.","Amil is off to a strong beginning with its seasonally strong first quarter and has the potential to exceed its earnings plan for the year. We see this market and Amil's market-leading offerings well positioned to grow and diversify in the traditions of both Amil and UnitedHealth Group.","Optum's momentum in growth and margin expansion should accelerate as it becomes increasingly capable and mature. Optum is now tracking to reach or exceed the upper end of its earnings outlook for 2013 and is establishing its own reputation for fundamental execution, service and innovation.","While we are performing well, we are doing so in a challenging economic, regulatory and health care climate. The headwinds we have discussed in our past sessions with you remain very real. By far, the most impactful headwind is the Medicare Advantage rate picture for 2014. While the final guidance was improved from the negative 8% all-in starting point, it is still a significant challenge. The cumulative net effect of the SGR resolution, the mandated ACA rate reductions, the strong negative impact of the risk recalibrations and the insurance stacks still leaves the Medicare Advantage program significantly underfunded, a more than 4% net reduction against the typical industry forward medical cost trend outlook of 3% or more for 2014.","These rates will undoubtedly impact the more than 14 million Medicare Advantage beneficiaries across the nation and will cause UnitedHealthcare to reduce benefits and pull back access in certain markets and will affect the growth prospects and earnings potential for our overall Medicare Advantage offerings across all our markets for 2014.","We do not expect the fastest-growing, most popular and most effective of the Medicare benefit options serving America's seniors to be underfunded to this extent in 2014, particularly with the backdrop of the already existing ACA mandates and sequestration. We will take the time to fairly assess the implications to our 2014 UnitedHealth Group growth outlook and whether our growth expectations for 2014 can be sustained in light of the continuation of both sequestration and a significantly greater rate setback than anyone could have expected.","Coming back to 2013, our original outlook did not factor in sequestration, which began on April 1. It has the potential to burden us in a range of $250 million to $300 million over the balance of 2013. We plan to absorb that within our $5.25 to $5.50 per share earnings outlook range for this year, which keeps us oriented to the midpoint of that range for now. And as always, we are committed to delivering to the absolute best of abilities for you.","Our balance sheet is strong. Our cash flows from operations are expected in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion this year. We have already targeted returning up to $4 billion of that to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","We expect the general narrative of UnitedHealth Group's story for 2014 to be largely the same as 2013. Our commercial benefit businesses, international businesses, Medicaid and military businesses should all continue to perform well. Medicare will likely experience market exits as well as in-market membership contraction as we reshape Medicare networks and benefits to respond to the continuing underfunding of this program. We will continue to manage operating costs and improve both service and productivity for this program. Optum will continue to grow and contribute more to our overall performance, as virtually every Optum business and product line is growing and performing well and is expected to continue in that path. We remain optimistic about the capacity and capability of our enterprise to serve society and to create the value for the people and customers we serve as well as for the health system at large.","Despite the great attention paid to rules, regulations and political maneuvering in health care, we keep sight of the fact that health care is about people: patients, individual consumers, physicians and other care professionals. If people are served well with appropriate-quality care provided in a respectful and compassionate manner at a cost that's reasonable and if the professionals who provide that health care are treated respectfully, then our health care system and our enterprise will move forward.","UnitedHealth Group has been built as a living, evolving set of businesses focused on working, serving and innovating on behalf of the people we serve in the communities where they live, putting capital to work to create a distinctive return to investors while simultaneously advancing the health care system for a distinctive and constructive return to society. Our strategy, market positions and consistent execution for customers differentiate us, and we are committed to responding creatively and aggressively to these more intense headwinds.","Now we'll be happy to take your questions this morning. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the conversion. Maybe you can help us size the headwind from an earnings standpoint. And then, are there many more accounts that were this large that are still risk based, and any comment on sort of incremental appetite to shift ahead of 2014?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think Jeff Alter will -- the impact, as we said, was really negligible, but Jeff Alter can really take you through this.","Jeff Alter","Yes, I think it's important to keep in mind that this was a very unique case, a $1.1 million fully insured case. I think it's probably the largest fully insured case in the industry. It was fully insured for decades. We've been partners with this municipality for a very long time, really because of regulatory constraints, and the conversion shouldn't be seen as anything, just playing out a decade-long processes of putting this case into a self-funded condition where most cases these size have always been. There aren't any -- as you can imagine, a case this size, there really isn't any earnings headwind. It was a long 3 -- almost 40-year relationship with this client. So the earnings are stable, is really just a plain funding conversion.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then what about on the smaller side?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Just -- yes. This is Gail Boudreaux. Just to follow Jeff Alter's comments. To the second part of your question, overall, actually, our conversions to self-funded have been relatively consistent. There's been a longstanding movement from fully insured to self-funded. But we didn't -- we have not seen any acceleration in that, to your earlier question. It's been pretty stable.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Can you speak broadly about 2014 headwinds and tailwinds? I'm interested here in the growth in some of the unique businesses that United has, such as Optum and Amil, but also in the core U.S. risk businesses, particularly given the incremental information that you've received since the last time we spoke on changes to the risk coding, calibration and counting rebasing for Medicare and provider contracting for exchanges with better clarity now on the unit cost basis you'll be using.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. So I think we'll parse these between -- a little bit between Optum and UnitedHealthcare. I'll start out with Optum, and I think our focus in UnitedHealthcare really will be around -- we will kind of be restating comments we made from our formal commentary about exchanges in Medicare. I think, really, Medicare is the principal headwind on '14. The rest of it, I think, we were trying to make it clear that our businesses are very strong, and our growth is very strong, including Medicare. But Larry, do you want to start with Optum?","Larry C. Renfro","Sure. Sarah, it's Larry Renfro. I think you're probably aware of the 3-year business plan that we put together last year. We call it One Optum, and we are -- as we finished 2012, we were in a situation of pretty good momentum that has carried forward in the first quarter. I think also, what we're experiencing with what's going on with rate cuts, there is obviously increased pressure in the market. And as a result, Optum is actually having a lot of opportunity that's presenting itself to us. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to ask 3 people. I'm going to start with Bill Miller and go to Stan Dennis and then to Kathy Hopkins to talk about their individual businesses within Optum so you'll get a better flavor for everything.","Bill Miller","Thanks, Larry, and thanks, Sarah. This is Bill Miller. I would say, on the behalf of OptumInsight, Larry is right that a lot of the growth certainly is expected based on all the work that we did in 2012 sort of establishing some sustainable new levels of performance. But alongside of that, and particularly in Q1, these pressures that Larry spoke about have showed up in Insight in 2 pretty simple ways: one, in our payer market and provider market, it's anything that our businesses do around operational performance, quality and efficiency, anything where our clients are feeling those pressures, those are opportunities that often flow to Optum. That's true in our per payer market around things like payment integrity, and in our provider market, it often shows up in some of our efficiency businesses and revenue cycle businesses. The other thing I would stress that have been key areas of the growth as this environment with higher compliance requirements, particularly in our payer business -- our provider business, we're seeing the uptake of all of our compliance businesses, pretty dramatically over 2012 but also going into 2013, and we expect that trend to continue as the heightened awareness about compliance is here to stay. So that's where I would characterize our big growth areas. There are others, but those are 2 critical ones. And I think they're brought on by some of the environments that both Steve and Larry have discussed. But Stan?","Stan Dennis","Thanks, Bill. Sarah, this is Stan Dennis, and I'm going to comment on the physician businesses that are principally organized within Collaborative Care and specialty networks. I'm going to then hand it off to Kathy Hopkins, and she's going to talk about our consumer-facing businesses. So we had a strong start to the year for this group. The Q1 performance is grounded in the solid plan that Larry referred to, created momentum coming into the quarter across all of our business units, and we remain committed to its execution. The results are driven principally by a healthy balance between growth and cost management discipline. I can't point to one business that drove the results for the group, as all the business units across the group are performing at the upper end of their range. Collaborative Care asset has a broad and growing footprint with solid performance. In a measured way, we are integrating these practices, which is part of our simplification plan, and doing so in a way that it adds value to improving care and affordability in the communities that we serve. We have several lines of business in our specialty networks division, all with strong performance, and the performance of our military reserve readiness business is solid as well. So we had a strong start to the quarter. We have our head down. We're going to continue to focus on executing on this plan, pivoting to growth. And as we do so, we believe these businesses will continue to scale nicely and perform well. Kathy?","Kathryn Hopkins","Thank you, Stan. This is Kathy Hopkins, and as Stan mentioned, I will speak to Optum's consumer-facing businesses. We're seeing strong demand for our care management, financial and distribution services. And as Larry mentioned, we're performing solidly against our 3-year plan. We're enjoying the benefits of our cost management programs that we put in place in the last year and expect these benefits to carry forward. We're also enjoying the benefits of scale and simplification of many of our business lines. We remain focused on execution and continuing to further develop our products and services that help consumers as they choose their benefits, navigate the health care system and make good decisions about their health. These programs are being well received in the marketplace. And as Stan said, I don't think I can point any one aspect of our business that contribute to be the driver, but we are really performing well across all aspects of our business.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Comment on Amil.","Bill Miller","You may comment here, Dirk.","Dirk McMahon","Sure. As from PBM's perspective, we had a nice growth year, and over the last 12 months, we've grown a little over 1 million members. What I would say, our value proposition remains strong. We've talked about it before in New York. Really, it's all about optimizing health outcomes and minimizing costs, and we do that by using our clinical engine to bring together all the pharmacies, the lab, the medical data, the behavioral data to have appropriate interventions, again, to minimize costs and optimize health outcome, and that value proposition continues to resonate within the marketplaces.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So pretty positive across the board. And then maybe Gail, you want to talk about UnitedHealthcare? And maybe Dave, at the end, comment on Amil?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Two questions, I think, you had embedded there. I'll focus on exchanges and Medicare. First on the exchanges side, I think Steve -- as Steve said in his opening comments, we don't see the exchanges on the commercial side having a significant positive or negative impact in 2014. We do think that there's still long-term growth opportunities in the exchanges, so we're still positive over the long term. Overall, our position on exchanges hasn't changed, as we gave you a broad range at the last call. As we think about the contracting side, again, I think I shared this last time that we see the contracting based on a market-by-market assessment and the economics needed to participate effectively in that market and an exchange. So those rates are going to vary from commercial to something less. We've had a pretty long history of having value-based networks and have been successful at that. And I would tell you, at this stage, our contracting for the exchange markets is going very well, so we feel positive about that. Turning to Medicare. That is the most impactful headwind that we face heading into 2014. Again, I think, in Steve's opening comments, as we think about a 4%-plus rate impact plus the impact of sequestration against the backdrop of a 3% trend in Medicare, that's an accumulated impact that is more significant than we would have expected. So that is -- we are in the process right now of doing our bids. We're doing a market-by-market assessment of what those imply by each of our markets, again, as part of the accumulated underfunding, but we do feel we have a very strong Medicare business. And as part of that assessment, we will be using our clinical assets and looking at optimizing our network to provide the broadest-based support and consistent benefits for seniors, because that's been part of what we've been looking to do. So that would, I think, define the headwind in terms of Medicare for '14.","Dirk McMahon","And the rest of the business line is all strong.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Yes, and the other -- good point on that. The other businesses, I think, as you saw in our growth this year, really positive about how our products and services are tracking. We're really pleased to have brought TRICARE on this year and feel very positively about the growth trajectory that we've seen, not only with this year, but over the last several years.","Stephen J. Hemsley","On Amil?","David S. Wichmann","And Sarah, Dave Wichmann on Amil. Thank you for your recognition of it. It's a very strongly positioned enterprise in Brazil. The brand, the value proposition from its own delivery components, its strong service reputation and the value that they provide to the various communities inside Brazil is, I believe, unmatched. Coupled with that are the market dynamics, which are such that they support meaningful growth in that market similar to what we're starting to see shape up here in 2013. So a combination of those 2 things should provide a good avenue for both revenue and earnings growth in 2014 and beyond. As we step into 2014 and into the future, we also see the potential to access meaningful new markets in Brazil that are not or are underserved by Amil today. And in addition, we see a great opportunity to address services offerings. As you might expect, there is -- there are very little capabilities to the extent that we see with Optum, and we see great opportunity for that enterprise in the future.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Could you elaborate on 2 issues related to your commentary on 2014: the collectibility of the Medicaid premium tax and, when you're saying you don't expect the exchanges to impact your commercial businesses, are you including the potential impact of any margin compression in small group? And can you address that potential issue as well?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. So Gail, do you want to discuss that, and then maybe Steve Nelson can talk about Medicaid?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Let me start with the first question, which was around the tax on -- insurance tax on Medicaid. Just -- so we've been in a constant dialogue with our state Medicaid directors around the impact of the tax, and we are including that in our rate exhibits as we talk to them. It's recognized as a cost to the program. I think what's important there is Medicaid is a little bit different than Commercial in that our rate negotiations occur not just at a single point in time, but they're ongoing. So they occur at the beginning of the cycle, throughout the cycle, and that's a pretty common occurrence. It's early in the process with them. We are including them, again, in the rate exhibit, and we think that there has been a positive dialogue about that. In terms of the impact on exchanges, our assessment is that at this stage, just given the overall impact, not necessarily commenting on margins in small group, but our overall participation in the exchanges, we have a very robust product offering outside of the exchanges. As I mentioned, one of the tools that we're using are to build value-based products. We've seen most of our small group growth in those products already, so we think we're very well positioned to also have a robust offering outside of the exchange.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Steve, do you want to add anything further?","Steve Nelson","Sure, just one point. It's Steve Nelson. I wanted to just add to Gail's comments, we have a very active and robust rate advocacy process and are engaged continuously with the states. And as you know, it's a challenging rate environment, but so far, as Gail mentioned, early, it's early in the year, but those conversations seem to be effective and very productive.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Oh. So am I hearing that you don't expect an impact on small group margins because you've got these value-based products and you think that you can convert people to them?","Steve Nelson","Yes.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think that's right. Gail, do you want to?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","No, I think we have a whole portfolio of products, Christine, and I think, our -- we've always had a strategy of offering employers a multitude of options. That's been pretty consistent, at least over the last 4 or 5 years. And while there are different pressures, clearly, it's a very competitive market in small group. We work really hard to make sure that we put our clinical and network assets to work to offer employers a broad range. But at this stage, we're not commenting on margins specifically there.","Stephen J. Hemsley","If we take a look at the growth that UnitedHealthcare has been able to achieve in the commercial markets that has been in the newer products, that has been in a wide variety of products. So I think that we've been deployed in this posture for a few years now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I apologize if you mentioned this earlier, but can you -- are you prepared to reiterate your view of overall earnings growth for 2014? And if you could, maybe a dovetail into that, what about Medicare Advantage enrollment? Do you -- directionally, can you say if you think that's going to be up or down based on everything that's changing?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, I thought that in our prepared comments that we had addressed that, so maybe I could restate a little bit for you, Matt.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, yes. I'm sorry. I probably -- I just missed it then. You did, okay.","Stephen J. Hemsley","It is -- I'll be happy to touch on it. But we were comfortable last quarter with the overall '14 earnings growth outlook before the 2014 Medicare Advantage rate actions were taken. So I think, then, as you stand back and look at the basic overall funding in terms of MA, it has been pressured the last couple of years and is already absorbing ACA mandates in terms of a rate reduction. And then if you believe that sequestration would come on top of that, you would never have expected a beginning point of an 8% net reduction in 2014 rates to occur. And then when they -- basically, as that process cleared and some relief was provided, you still stand back and look at a net reduction of 4% or more against an overall 3% cost trend in the program. So taken together with the other pressures, that's really not sustainable funding, in our view, and it will cost us to reconsider our overall '14 growth rate in this program, to evaluate market exits, to address benefits, to reshape our networks in those markets. And that was not really the premise as we basically leaned into 2014 from a growth outlook point of view. So we are evaluating that at this point in time given the finalization of those programs, really, on a market-by-market basis, to the extent they are actions that we can take to mitigate this continued program and the underfunding and assess whether '14 can absorb that change and still grow earnings. So our long-term view on Medicare is unchanged. We're very strong in terms of the efficacy of the program. The underfunding has been a challenge, and we are reassessing that '14, based upon the rate actions that were taken. And that's why, as we discussed in the previous question, that really our focus, when we look at headwinds for 2014, is around Medicare.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is on the government side. Can you -- 2 things. One, can you tell us how much the Part D seasonality impacted the quarter versus the typical that you'd previously seen because of that shift to the enhanced plan? And then you mentioned the pressure on Medicare margins due to rates. It's clear Medicare margins, [indiscernible] they came down, MLR up this year, going to do somewhat similar -- you've got pressures in '14. You've talked about a 3% to 5% margin. Can you tell us how -- are you there yet? Are you close to it? Do you expect to be there next year? Just to give us some idea on how to size that headwind going forward from Medicare.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So Dan?","Daniel Schumacher","Justin, Dan Schumacher. So your first question, with respect to the Part D timing and the implications of that on the quarter, as you look at it in the context of our overall UnitedHealth Group loss ratio, you can think of that in terms of about 50 to 100 basis points' impact to our overall group loss ratio in the quarter. Basically, our revenue is -- -- recognition is being shifted out later in the year, so it's a big impact in the first quarter, moderates in the second, and then it recovers in the third and the fourth quarter. With respect to the margin performance in our government programs, our target margin is in the 3% to 5% range, and some years, we perform in excess of that. And we were -- we are near that range now in our performance.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So overall, you feel like you're near that range now?","Daniel Schumacher","Yes.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just slip one other in on the recalibration, can you give us an idea of what you think that is? I mean, if I did the math right from what you said, you thought it was 8 before, now it's 4. You got 5% back from the SGR effects. So are you saying you think that's about a 100 basis point headwind from the risk or recalibration, the new model there? Or do you think it's more or less than that?","Stephen J. Hemsley","No, it think it's more than that, Justin, substantially more, which is why we're commenting on it. Dan?","Daniel Schumacher","Yes. I think, Justin, as we look at the impact of that across the industry, we would size the recalibration more in the order of magnitude of around a 2.5% impact.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I would assume it's higher on maybe HMO plans that code better, have higher acuity. Could it be -- I've heard industry experts say it could be as much as 500 basis points for a real good IPA-based HMO versus maybe even less than 250 for a PPO that's maybe less well coded. I mean, is that about right?","Daniel Schumacher","I'm not going to comment on specific product offerings, but I will tell you, you're right. There is certainly variation as you look across products and geographies in terms of the impact of recalibration, but not to -- not likely the order of magnitude you're talking about.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So not as wide a spread.","Operator","We'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just to take a minute to talk about the OptumRx situation. Have you sized the cost that you're incurring this year to transition that in-house? And does that spread evenly over the course of the year? And is there early commentary on the selling season for them and what that looks like?","Dirk McMahon","Well, I would say a couple of things. So first of all, how is the transition going? We migrated 400,000, and the first of the year, 400,000 members converted. We actually also added 500,000 new members to the platform at the beginning of the year. On 4\/1, we just added 2 million members, so we've migrated 3 million members so far. From a run rate standpoint, it'll be $200 million in operating profit. On a run rate basis, we still have some ramp-up costs and development costs in 2013. We haven't specifically sized those externally yet, but we'll -- that's really where we sit.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But you'll likely...","Stephen J. Hemsley","That was Dirk McMahon, by the way. And you'll likely carry those into the third quarter as you go through that, and then they'll start to peel down in the fourth quarter and into '14.","Dirk McMahon","Yes, that's the important point. We have development and ramp-up of personnel costs throughout the first half of the year. And as Steve said, they'll peel down, and we'll hit our full run rate in 2014.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Any comment about the selling season so far? I know we're still a little early.","Dirk McMahon","We've had some -- we've sold some cases already, of course. What I would say is our proposal buying is up. It is a little bit early. We've seen an increase in proposals over last year, and I guess I -- that's all I'll comment at this point.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to the revised commercial MLR guidance. I want to make -- is the 80 basis point decline entirely due to the risk to ASO conversion? And then with regard to the quarter specifically, year-to-year, the MLR was down 40 bps. We don't have the prior year development by segment. I'm just try to get a sense for, one, in the change of guidance, is that all related to conversion? And two, what would the MLR have been without the conversion in the quarter?","Daniel Schumacher","Chris, it's Dan Schumacher. So with respect to the commercial loss ratio and the impact of the funding conversion, it was around 80 basis points in the quarter and on the full year. So that's why we've revised our full year medical care ratio guidance to 81.2% plus or minus 50 basis points, so down 80 basis points from our Investor Day guidance. As you look at the influencing factors year-over-year in the commercial loss ratio, certainly that played a meaningful role in it. We also had the absence of leap year, which is more pronounced in the commercial business, and then pushing the other way would be the change in development as well as the large rebate true-up that we recognized in the first quarter of 2012. So those are the major impacts in the commercial loss ratio in the quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to stick with commercial loss ratio. The -- couple of hospitals have come out and talked about low volumes in the first quarter. Would you say that -- lower than they expected, anyway. Would say that they were more in line with what you expected, or is it too early to see enough development in the claims to reflect those low volumes in the first quarter?","Daniel Schumacher","Dan Schumacher again. As we look at our medical cost performance in the quarter, we were very pleased with it, and it paced out as we expected. So as you look at both the composition of it from a unit cost and utilization perspective as well as the elements by cost category, we're not seeing any meaningful change in that from what we said in Investor Day.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So your cost trend guidance and the buckets within that guidance are essentially unchanged. Is that -- do I understand that correctly?","Daniel Schumacher","Correct.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And we really aren't necessarily standing on claims. We have good visibility with respect to particularly inpatient settings and so forth, so again, unchanged, but we're not sitting and waiting for claims data. That's the only thing I'd like to correct to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","So coming to the quarter, you've talked a lot about the headwinds for the next year. I'm trying to get an understanding of what is your strategy for 2013 and 2014 on the share-versus-margin tradeoff in '13 and how that might play out into '14. Is this...","Stephen J. Hemsley","I didn't hear this clearly. Could you just restate it again?","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Yes. So the notion of the share-versus-margin tradeoff between Commercial versus the government businesses. You've expanded margins in Commercial. I understand it's largely leap year and MLR true-up and all that, but the surveys are showing that you and other companies are pricing up in Commercial. So you're certainly moving toward margin over share. If you look at Medicare, on the other hand, Part D, you came out with a $15 product on Part D. You've had outsized share gains Part D, outsized share gains in MA. And what is your target margin? And why should it be 3% to 5% in Medicare when, with an 85% MLR and the MLR flow rate, you can do better than that at a 10% SG&A?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, that's a very good question. But I also would maybe level set this a little bit that we try to keep our pricing and our approaches to the marketplace in a consistent, stable approach year-to-year, so pricing essentially to our cost, trying to innovate and advance a variety of products to meet the different needs of the marketplace. So it is maybe more broad and more balanced than your question suggests, and we are out to optimize the performance of our business and the performance of our margins, no matter what the circumstances are, in the context of maintaining sustainable products and sustainable offerings in the marketplace. And I agree with your point that we should be able to get above target margins at full scale and at full operating performance in mature markets. And I think in many respects, we do that both in the commercial and Medicare sectors. And now after that kind of commercial announcement, I'll hand this over to Gail and Jeff and so forth to kind of respond to the pricing. Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Jeff Alter. Yes, I think Steve said it well. We have a very long philosophy around commercial pricing, which is we price to our forward cost trend and really don't play too many games around that. And that has served us well over the years, and we believe it will continue to serve us well, maybe even service us in a much better way, as we get into the '14, '15 time frame. So I don't think we really are discussing a tradeoff. We just -- we have a disciplined pricing methodology that has served us well, and we continue to employ that as we go forward.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And while we always have to pay attention to it, the fact is we've had very steady, consistent growth in both self-funded and actually, on a relative basis, market share gains in the risk-based because of the level of contraction in that marketplace and maintaining margins. And then on the Medicare side?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Well, I think we shared -- I mean, the issue on Medicare, as we shared on this call, is really the underfunding of the program, and we worked very hard on both the clinical side as well as the network optimization, and then finally, our cost structure. That's been an area of focus. So as I think about all of our government programs and our target margins there, we work to be extremely efficient while improving service. So the operating cost is a lever, and then our clinical programs are important to delivering value to beneficiaries.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And I'd just throw in that basically, these are very well-established, well-penetrated programs in the marketplace, almost 30% market share in Medicare Advantage. And the underfunding pressure is really more intense in the Medicare Advantage product line. So it's not like Medicare across-the-board supplemental offerings, Part D offerings are really different. It's the funding, overall funding philosophies of the Medicare Advantage platform that are -- that need to be strengthened.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","So just one quick follow-up on that. On MA, as you're doing your product bids, which need to be submitted in June, and all this underfunding you're alluding to in 2014, should we expect that you will be, as we're modeling out 2014, that your margins will get better because you bid more conservatively at the expense of enrollment growth? Or will it go the other way in that you're willing to -- in your optimization, you're willing to gain share and keep losing margin?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Maybe I will start out by saying, first of all, it's -- like anything in health care, it's a market-by-market proposition, which is why we need to be very thoughtful about how we go forward in this. In some markets, we'll take actions that will be more conservative and more pulling back. In other markets, we may not be -- feel necessary to do that. It also brings in dynamics of network positioning and so forth, so it is a much more multifaceted than simply what our benefit would be in a particular market. And I think that's why it takes time, and there isn't kind of a single-gear response to your question that we'll price like x and calculate market share. Although I would say that, based upon the funding level, you'd have to -- we've been clear we will be pulling back from markets, and so we don't expect the growth in the MA product line, the MA product line, in 2014 to be as robust because of the actions we're going to have to take to, as your point, preserve margins.","Operator","And we'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to stick on MA, and just interested if you can talk a little bit about utilization trends observed so far in the new membership that you've added so far this year relative to the more mature MA membership that you already have. And then maybe just touch on the lives that you've added in California, particularly relative to some of the PPO products that members were previously enrolled in with competitors and how you're seeing the utilization trends in those members.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dan or Jack?","Daniel Schumacher","Sure. Scott, Dan Schumacher. With respect to our utilization in MA, I will tell you that it's pacing as -- about as we expected. Certainly, our new growth tends to have a higher first year loss ratio, and that improves in the second year. And that improvement comes on the maturation of the revenue as we get more complete diagnoses as well as our clinical programs begin to take hold and those results begin to emerge. So from a utilization perspective, it's pacing as we expected, but obviously, our new growth comes with a higher loss ratio.","Jack Larsen","Yes, and I would say -- Scott, Jack Larsen. The overall portfolio or profile, I guess, of new membership we got was very much in keeping with our expectations. As you pointed out in your question, it's only been 2 months, really, of development with these new members. And so far, I don't think we're seeing anything unanticipated.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just as a quick follow-up. Just interested if you can maybe give us some initial comments just on the CalPERS contract that were announced, and then maybe just talk about some of the changes that CalPERS might have made with the new structures that make you more comfortable about participating in CalPERS risk business given that historically, when the public plans that participated used to be a pretty volatile book of business.","Jeff Alter","It's Jeff Alter. It's really hard for us to comment on CalPERS right now. We're pleased. We thought we had a very strong offering for that RFP. We're pleased that we were selected as one of the 4, and we're actually in the second phase right now of negotiations, so very hard for us to comment on that.","John S. Penshorn","John Penshorn here. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Was hoping you could walk through the mechanics of sequestration, touching specifically on how much you're assuming you're going to be able to pass through providers in the hit you're talking about and how long you think it will take to fully offset the impacts. In other words, on that last piece, just go into if it's going to be as big of an impact in '14 as you think it's going to be in '13?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Carl, it's Gail Boudreaux. So as you know, sequestration results in a lower reimbursement of 2% for our Medicare Advantage and Part D program. We've shared this before. We have some natural hedges to that. In Steve's opening comments, we talked about the impact. Our goal, what we're going to be doing is we'll be offsetting our reimbursement where our payments are tied and indexed to fee-for-service Medicare, that will be offset. And then our lower payments to capitated providers. Those that are not as tied to that, we'll be working, obviously, to manage through that as part of the overall program. But obviously, given the time to implement, that's why we've identified the $250 million to $300 million impact in 2013.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Some programs don't have any, like Part D [indiscernible]...","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","And Part D doesn't have any in there, so that's part of the issue.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And we'll get more absorption as this goes on. We'll get this more absorbed into the marketplace. So the impact, going forward, should dissipate.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I don't want to belabor all the other points. I guess just a question on the repurchases. I know we'll see it in the Q, but could you give us an update on maybe the monthly repurchase numbers, and maybe more specifically, how much was done after February 15?","David S. Wichmann","Josh, it's Dave.","Stephen J. Hemsley","This may be the first question we've ever been asked on monthly repurchase activity.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It was an important quarter, I think.","David S. Wichmann","Well, as you -- we repurchased about 9.9 million shares in the quarter. And as you would expect, we try to repurchase -- our mechanisms are such that we repurchase more when the stock price is down. And so as it tailed off, our repurchase activity accelerated. I won't get into specifics about what we purchased in the last half of February or through March, but ...","Stephen J. Hemsley","We're methodical, so...","John S. Penshorn","But we're very methodical about what we do. And certainly, as our stock price goes down, we're more heavily in the market.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But you guys have discretion on that, right, based on your corporate outlook and things like that? That's just not a mechanical calculation based on stock price, is it?","David S. Wichmann","That's right. We do have discretion with respect to that. As you recall, Josh, given the Amil transaction, we were trying to meter to bring in a debt-over-debt-plus-equity at 35% by the end of the second quarter of the year. Overall, we said we'd do $2.5 billion to $3 billion of share repurchases. So we're edging up towards the upper end of that range for this year. And so that, obviously, mathematically, would increase our repurchase activity for the balance of the year.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So it -- we are on plan, and we are the levels that we would have anticipated for the quarter. We are regular and methodical in the marketplace. And I would say when we -- what changes is the pace of it. So we pace it in terms of that, but we are basically at this on a regular basis. This is a methodical program. The pacing of it changes, and that's all.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I know you commented on the exchanges. I was just wondering, in terms of that, as you continue to evaluate them, how much of a factor is it as it relates to some states now considering taking the Medicaid expansion and running through the exchange? Is that a factor for you guys or really not meaningful in light of the broader picture?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'll -- maybe I'll have Steve Nelson comment on this. But what the beauty of our diversified model is, is that we basically cover all the markets. And we've said, actually, probably as much as 2 years ago, when it became clear that this kind of a marketplace channel would become established, that we really are covered on it on both sides, from the Medicaid side and the commercial side, so...","Steve Nelson","Sure. Michael, Steve Nelson. States are evaluating a lot of different alternatives to -- they're struggling with how to cover their uninsured, bring down the cost of Medicaid programs. So you've seen just one alternative that they're considering alongside a variety of things. And we're very engaged in those conversations with the states and bring a lot of capabilities. And the advantage is, as Steve mentioned, we have broad capabilities not just in the Medicaid program, but across all of our products. And so the exchange decision and conversation is one that is outside of just Medicaid or commercial. So let me just ask Jeff to comment on the exchange strategy. And with respect to -- Nevada, I think, is one in particular that has required us to participate in exchange as part of our Medicaid contract.","Jeff Alter","Sure. It's Jeff Alter. Yes, as we've said in the past, we're going to gauge our participation based upon how we assess each one of those local markets. And I would say that part of that assessment is our commercial teams working very closely with the -- our Medicaid teams coming up with the value proposition for not just one or the other, but for both. And that is part of our decision-making process, as we pace through market-by-market decisions. I will reiterate, though, that as we said in the past, we believe that there's going to be some pacing with exchanges, and it's not just a '14 event. It is a market that will develop and mature and be part of the distribution of small business as well as covering individuals and, perhaps, in some states and some markets, Medicaid population. And as of that market develops, we will make those decisions together.","Operator","We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I'll try to be quick with this question. One of the things that I think the market's focused on, and appropriately, as you have this, is the issues around MA. But some of the commentary and I think some of the concern we're seeing is a perception that MA is the single either largest or only growth driver in the business. Perhaps you can help us to put this in the appropriate perspective and view it with the appropriate level of concern, which is, is it one component of growth? Is it the only component of growth? Can you parse out the growth for us that you're seeing, if not in 2014, then a year like 2012 or 2013? Help guide us in our thinking about the potential impact of changes in MA versus the performance of the rest of the business.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think we tried to suggest that the performance of the rest of the businesses is really quite strong. That the business, the Optum businesses not only exceeded expectations for the quarter, the momentum is growing there. And it wasn't in isolated Optum businesses, it was across the entire expanse of that portfolio of businesses and offerings. And we see them as a meaningful growth element and an increasingly growth element for us in 2014 and beyond. And that is really unchanged. I think what's -- what we will have been pleased with is how rapidly this has gotten traction and the substance of it, how solid the business is maturing. The Amil business is another platform that we think has significant potential and where we would be looking to continue to align our combined capabilities and potentially continue to invest to build that to be an even more meaningful platform going forward, 2014 and the years to come. And then the UnitedHealthcare businesses, just take a look at the growth, which is why we came back to the $5 million over the last 3 years. And the broad base of it, growth in every single offering, meaningful growth. We think market share gains across each of them. And it's not just a current year phenomenon, this is 3 years or more. And that doesn't even include the $3 million that we'll be reporting next quarter on the TRICARE business. So the focus is to optimize those businesses across their expanse, and that was the whole purpose of the diversified business model in the first place. And Medicare is one that is getting more than its share of attention because of the fundings posture that it's experiencing. And that one is really focused to Medicare Advantage. We will work through that as well. It is just a more severe funding posture than we would have anticipated given all the elements that have hit the Medicare Advantage program over the last year or so. So does that put it into perspective?","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","It does. I guess what I was kind of hoping for was something more quantitative than that, which might help us think through how much might be at risk. But I don't suppose I'm going to get that, am I?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, I think if you were going to get it, I would have put it in -- carefully put it in the prepared comments. So what I did carefully put in there is that we are assessing this very seriously in terms of evaluating to what extent we can overcome the headwinds of Medicare Advantage with all the other elements of our business and produce growth in 2014. And that's our goal.","Operator","Next, we have Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to stay on this MA side of things, because I'm still a bit confused, a couple of points here. I think it really it really comes down maybe to expectations. It sounds like, versus what we were expecting anyway, the MA MLR, was disappointing. But when you talk about it, the things that you highlight as far as lack of development, as far as Part D seasonality, as far as PPACA cuts, it sounds like all those things you actually highlighted last quarter, and so they were all known things. Did you think that Q1 was in line as far as you feel on the MA side of things, and that maybe it's just a perception side from our side of it? Or was Q1 a little bit weaker than you thought on MA particularly? And then 2, the comments about 2014. Although I understand the rate for 2014 is not a good rate, it is it more or less what I think everyone thought it would be back in January. Obviously, we got hit with a worse proposal, and then it got fixed kind of back, I think, to where we all thought it was going to be. So I'm really trying to understand why the tone has changed so much from the view about 2014 growing, when to me, really, the only thing that's changed in the MA reg is really the coding adjustments. Is the coding just really that big of an issue as far as being the unexpected part of the final role versus where we were before to cause you to say, \"Yes, MA, were not going to be able to grow it, and maybe our whole earnings number is at risk for 2014\"?","Stephen J. Hemsley","So that's a quite an involved question, but -- so let me see if I can provide a simpler response and answer. We're very happy with our MA business. We have a very good growth. We have very good products. We have great positioning into the marketplace. It is perhaps affected by contrast to the prior year quarter, where we had meaningful reserve development and never anticipated we would ever -- we didn't anticipate it in the first quarter of '12 to have that level of reserve development. We certainly didn't expect it to repeat in the first quarter here. So I think the health of our MA business is quite robust. Our concern is the forward looking. And that may be an expectation issue because, when you take a look at all the elements of -- that have hit the funding experience of the MA program, I think the very significant factor was, in lieu of that background, starting out with a negative 8% and then basically coming out with a final, which is, in essence, a relatively negative 4%, maybe even a touch higher against a 3% overall trend, strikingly higher than -- so the year before was 1.5% in that zone. That would have been more manageable. So it is really overcoming that funding posture going forward that then begins to cascade through a variety of things. To respond to that, you need to think about benefit adjustments that are more dramatic than what we have typically liked to manage in the marketplace, network adjustments that are more dramatic. And so I think the difference is, I know that some people were relieved that the SGR came through and that -- focus on that element. But when you stand back and look at the total funding status of that program, it's down 4%, and that is significant.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But that's not what you were -- down 4% what we were kind of assuming the number would be if you throw in all-in. But you're saying that you -- when you made that comment before, you were thinking maybe similar to the way it's been the last couple of years, which is maybe down 1.5%.","Stephen J. Hemsley","If you are thinking of supporting the program, if you think about that as perhaps the best offering of Medicare in the marketplace, the one that seniors have high satisfaction with and strong growth and strong response and one that manages costs, the posturing of funding, that is what we're taking -- is what we're discussing. Think it is the expectation, Kevin.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Halper with Lazard Capital.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes. As you look at the development of the state exchanges, understanding that you're being very deliberate in pursuing those opportunities, can you sort of update us on where you think the whole program stands? I know it's a general question. But more specifically, the federal government looks like they're under increasing pressure to get this thing done. And do you foresee any scenarios where the administration has to back off and say, \"We need another 6 months or 1 year to get this done.\" And just your views on that?","Stephen J. Hemsley","We really don't have any insight on that. We are presuming that these programs and these capabilities will go into market as scheduled. That has been the posture throughout, and we are acting to be ready to respond to those. So we are not seeing or believing or suggesting anything to the contrary. We're presuming that it is, going forward, as planned and as scheduled.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But can you just go over the operating cash flow? It was fairly very weak in the quarter. When do you expect to reverse itself in the second quarter? And what exactly caused the weakness this quarter?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dave?","David S. Wichmann","Peter, it's Dave Wichmann. Thanks for your question. The operating cash flows were actually stronger this quarter than they were in the comparative quarter last year. And they came in line exactly as we expected. The cash flows at UnitedHealth Group, at least, are seasonally down in the first and second quarters, and they are stronger in the third and the fourth. The thing that really affect that are the timing of a risk adjustment payments, which generally come in the third, and then also the Part D timing, as an example. So but that's -- we're -- we expect to follow pretty much a pattern similar to last year. Operating cash flows for the year should be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, which is 1.3x or more times net income.","John S. Penshorn","This is John Penshorn. Dave, I think last year, we also had some timing differences around some of those government receivables in the second quarter. They came in early. So it may even be a little more second half biased. Is that fair?","David S. Wichmann","That's right.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you didn't change the guidance on your consolidated medical loss ratio. I assume that's really just the offset of sequestration versus the commercial account conversion. Is that correct?","John S. Penshorn","That's right, Peter.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. and then you talked about recalibration being 250 basis points. Was that over 2 years, or was that over 1 year?","Stephen J. Hemsley","No, that's 1 year. So that's your 3-part 1-question limit, Peter, so thank you very much.","So wrapping up our call today, I'd like to recap just a couple of points. Our enterprise is performing well. In the first quarter, we delivered significant growth in people served, in market share, in revenue across all of our businesses and internationally. UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, military businesses, as well as Amil, all continue to diversify and steadily grow. Optum's momentum is accelerating as the market for health services expands, and it's expanding, we think, at kind of exponential levels. And we believe no other company has the positioning, the resources, the people to take on the challenges of health care and succeed in this marketplace and in our mission. So thank you very much for joining us today. We'll see you next quarter.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 17, 2013, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our strong 2012 growth and earnings performance, affirm our outlook for 2013 and discuss in broad terms how and why we see 2014 and beyond as a period of continued growth and opportunity.","Full year 2012 revenues grew 9% to $110.6 billion and net earnings were $5.28 per share. 2012 per share earnings increased 12% year-over-year, attributable to both broad-based growth and intense management of medical and operating costs.","Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum exceeded their fourth quarter revenue and earnings outlooks from our November investor conference. Cash flows from operations of $7.2 billion were again 1.3x net income. Fourth quarter cash flows were $1.7 billion or 1.4x net income for the quarter. And we ended the year with $1.1 billion in nonregulated cash. We raised our dividend by 30% earlier this year and repurchased more than $3 billion of our shares.","Before reviewing these results in more detail, I would like to discuss a couple of recent topics we believe have been prominent in the minds of investors. The first topic is exchanges. There is significant interest in the impact exchanges may have on the sector in total and on UnitedHealthcare specifically. We can share our thinking about exchanges only in broad terms at this point, recognizing, one, there's still many significant unknowns with respect to how exchanges will begin and actually work. And as you know, details in this sector count. So we are holding back on making specific decisions in many cases until greater clarity can be established. And secondly, the way we think about exchange markets and how we may position ourselves state-by-state with respect to exchanges, we see to be proprietary competitive insights.","So to begin, we are advocates of efforts to expand coverage to as many Americans as possible, but we would never have drawn the line at exchanges alone. If you want to expand coverage, then use every channel possible, make it easy, convenient, ubiquitous. We advocate that exchanges be a level playing field and fairly regulated. The more complex exchanges become, the greater the potential for unintended market distortions and therefore, the greater reluctance to use them.","Health care at its core is local. Theoretically, there will be as many as 100 very local market exchanges, 50 for individual coverage and 50 for small group, and that's just the beginning. You can expect each will operate somewhat differently. So there is a great deal to evaluate before pursuing any of these exchange markets, similarly to what we do today for Medicare and Medicaid.","The level of interest in exchanges will be driven by how we assess each local market, how the exchange and its rules are set up state-by-state and our market position relative to others in the market, as we see it today and as we evaluate it going forward. And that equation will evolve and change over time as exchanges mature. So going in positions on exchanges will be just that. We are not tied to them in one direction or another. Broadly, we would expect to participate in a number of exchanges. We're not going to offer a precise number but a broad range, perhaps from 10 to 25 or more with absolutely no firm commitment to that range.","We will only participate in exchanges that we assess to be fair, commercially sustainable and provide a reasonable return on the capital they will require. And like Medicaid, if we are in a situation or market dynamic that we do not see as sustainable, we will either not participate in the first instance or ultimately withdraw. Similarly, we will continually evaluate state-based exchanges that may not have been attractive when initially introduced. So as they mature and evolve, if we see them as both fair and sustainable, we would look to participate. And in a perfect world, we would participate in them all.","Exchanges will create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses, depending on ultimate member migration patterns for each market, the pace of that migration and its impact on our established membership. We do not expect these impacts to be dramatic or necessarily negative to us.","Today, our individual and 2- to 50-member risk-based health benefit businesses contribute approximately 10% to our total earnings. Their margins are consistent with our overall commercial insurance results. And the feedback we receive from this community is that they remain committed to offering health benefits to their employees. So while these earnings are still meaningful, we are diversified to the point where we do not feel compelled to engage in any markets where conditions leave us uncertain as to long-term viability.","There has been speculation as to how exchanges will happen by September 30, 2013, and what their impact on 2014 will be. And the simple answer is we don't know. The idea that robust exchanges, whether state-based or federal, will be enrolling large numbers of individuals or groups by September seems challenging. And our sense is the initial consumer and small-business response may be modest. But we are committed to being ready. We believe we have strong product offerings that are valuable to the market in terms of quality, access, affordability, innovative design and service excellence. And these characteristics and features are compelling in or out of an exchange channel.","In the long term, we are expecting and preparing for an exchange category of coverage to become established as a new benefit category between Medicaid and the traditional commercial benefits markets. We anticipate this category will have meaningful participation that we will serve in the majority of those markets. That it will be a rational product category with sustainable margins and that our businesses and our earnings will grow as exchanges become more established.","Moving to pricing and medical cost trends. There has been no shortage of commentary about the 2013 commercial pricing environment across the commercial benefits industry. The positioning of the ACA insurance fee and rate review and approval process is across states and against the backdrop of 2013 commercial medical cost trend outlooks. We can only comment on our experience. We've just seen the commercial pricing environment strengthen from that in 2012 in general. We have nearly 70% of our 2013 business priced and the markets have been rational in our view, competitive but better than 2012 for us. We have been very steady in our pricing disciplines year-to-year, consistently adhering to and aligning to our forward view of costs, and we take measured membership losses and instances where we cannot get our price, as we did in the commercial risk markets in 2012, and expect to again in 2013, as we discussed at our investor conference.","We have a broad and diverse portfolio of innovative product offerings that align to buyer values, so we are able to hit a broad range of price points. Accordingly, our membership losses have been relatively muted, particularly when considering the ongoing impact of funding conversions. We have included the ACA insurance tax and other ACA cost factors in our 2013 rate filings. We are working effectively with our state partners through the rate approval process. As always, some had been more challenging than others. At the end of the day, we must price to our costs. And if we conclude that a state's posture on commercial insurance pricing is not economically sustainable, we will have no choice but to withdraw from that market. We have not been put in that position to date.","Our medical cost management capabilities have steadily strengthened year-by-year and our networks are very cost-competitive. We have a market-leading spectrum of pay-for-performance arrangements, now exceed $20 billion in annual medical spend. Our 2012 all-in commercial medical cost trends were effectively managed to under 5.5%. And we are constantly refining and intensifying our health care affordability efforts. We remain comfortable with our 2013 medical cost trend outlook range of 5% to 6%. We are confident in our pricing disciplines, the yields we are achieving and our resulting 2013 commercial care ratio outlook, which remains unchanged at 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","Now turning back to 2012. Both business platforms produced strong results, well above our expectations as we entered 2012. UnitedHealthcare grew by nearly 2 million people in the U.S. and added 4.4 million in Brazil late in the year. And revenue grew by 8% year-over-year. 2012 operating earnings was $7.8 billion, exceeded our most recent outlook. And our fourth quarter operating margin of 6.1% was stronger than we expected. We expect that ever-improving alignment of benefit designs, consumer engagements, clinical management and care delivery relationships to deliver quality healthcare for consumers, along with competitive cost performance in 2013 and beyond.","Optum grew earnings from operations by 14% in 2012. Optum's disciplined simplification and integration agenda is advancing at the same time its revenue growth is accelerating and expanding its margins. In the fourth quarter, all Optum segments grew both earnings and operating margins year-over-year, driven by business growth and the benefits of investments made in the first half of the year. As 2013 begins, we remain optimistic. Both Optum and UnitedHealthcare are solidly on plan as we move into the year. Our businesses are executing well for customers and we continue to grow market share.","The initial OptumRx customer transitions and new business installations across OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare have been virtually seamless, including our new Medicaid assignment in Kansas. UnitedHealthcare's preparations to serve TRICARE, which will begin in April of this year, are going well. And we have been awarded the opportunity to serve an estimated 20,000 people in the Florida state Long-term Care Program beginning in August, 2013. UnitedHealthcare is also beginning on an exclusive basis to market to the Medicare beneficiaries residing in The Villages in Florida, the largest retirement community in the U.S. We continue to feel positive about our Medicare growth across all product categories.","UnitedHealthcare is experiencing strong January medical membership growth, in excess of 600,000 people, led by Public and Senior sector growth and positive results for our Employer & Individual. Strong fee-based commercial growth should more than offset the expected decline in risk-based products caused by the weak employment market and UnitedHealthcare pricing disciplines.","We're also experiencing strong growth in Part D. UnitedHealthcare created a new, affordable basic plan for consumers nationally and elevated its large 4 million member plan to an enhanced plan status. The change to enhanced status changes the seasonal patterns of earning recognition, shifting more of the profits to later in the year with no impact on full year profitability.","For Optum, we expect 2013 to show a strong growth, with operating earnings advancing in a range of approximately 35% to over 40% above 2012 levels, as we previously communicated. The Optum businesses are seasonal in their progression of earnings, and we expect the first half and second half contributions to be proportionately similar to 2012, say, 40% in the first half and 60% in the second.","Our annual outlook for 2013 remains unchanged with the revenues forecasted in a range of 500 -- of $123 billion to $124 billion of net earnings and net earnings in a range of $5.25 to $5.50 per share. The rest of the 2013 financial coordinates we shared with you at our November 27 conference remain consistent as well.","Perhaps I can offer a few comments on consensus earnings estimates for 2013. In total for the year, we are in the same general zone as the Street, which is typically oriented to the top side of our $5.25 to $5.50 per share range. We see quarterly progressions somewhat differently with our progressions more oriented to the second half of the year due to such things as the dynamics of growing seasonality, the mechanics of the Part D program and the like. And we should mention again that last year's first quarter had more than $0.30 per share in prior year net reserve and rebate development, which we do not forecast.","So the takeaway is on an annual basis, the upper end of our guidance is in the general zone with consensus. The quarterly progressions we see for 2013 favor the back half of the year more than the current consensus numbers would suggest, something on the order of a 3% to 4% shift from the first half to the second half with most of it coming from the first quarter.","Our capital disciplines remain focused and consistent. 2012 was an unusually active year in terms of acquisitions and business development. We expect 2013 to be more moderate. We continue to forecast operating cash flows to range from $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion with capital expenditures to stay within a range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. As we have said, we will look to continue to advance and mature our dividend in 2013, a process our board will address in our midyear session. And we expect to repurchase shares near to the $3 billion end of the range provided at our investor conference.","Despite the fact that we are only 16 days into 2013, there is an unusual level of focus on 2014, given the anticipated ACA changes. Our foregoing comments clearly indicate that we do not have any unique insights or precision around the 2014 performance outlook. And as always, there are other potential factors impacting both the broad marketplace, as well as our specific industry sectors, that may influence 2014 performance aside from ACA-driven market changes. What we can say is that based on our view of what is known at this point and for our overall mix of business, we do not view 2014 in a negative light relative to our expected 2013 earnings per share outlook and that 2014, 2015 and beyond hold the potential to be periods of positive growth and opportunity for our businesses.","Factors that play into that perspective include a belief that the federal administrations, charged with ACA implementation, are interested in smooth implementation and sustainable adoption, interest shared by critical policymakers and legislators. A meaningful number of ACA market changes have already been introduced to the market: minimal MLR rules, benefit and coverage expansions, et cetera, with limited disruption. Administrative and regulatory guidance to date has been rational, predicable and  reasonably collaborative, given the nature of the ACA legislation. There is certainly a great deal more to work through and significant unknowns. But so far, it has been manageable. In the end, the ACA expands an enormous national healthcare market that will be served by the private sector.","As we have said from the beginning, the ACA will reshape some market rules but will not change the basic nature of the market needs for high quality healthcare at affordable costs and for a higher-performing overall healthcare system. The ACA will not determine who will respond to be the ultimate long-term winners or losers in serving those market needs. The ACA actually intensifies the demand for the core competencies we deliver through our businesses. They are knowledged to optimize care resources and capability to manage, both high quality clinical care and costs, information to inform and align healthcare for optimal performance on both individual and overall system levels and enabling technology to make it all work in modern and efficient ways.","Over the last several years, we have shaped our enterprise as a uniquely adaptable construct of market-facing businesses that serve the critical market that the ACA is expanding. Today, our businesses are performing at more consistent and higher quality levels than ever before. We have simplified our businesses to be well focused and coordinated. We are more integrated and scaled with steadily increasing productivity. We've been driving market innovations at higher levels than at any time in our history. We have invested in brands and have steadily elevated our market visibility and reputation. We have strong and deep leadership and have been investing in our people and our culture.  We have maintained an appropriate balance in our capital stewardship, steadily returning more capital to investors while building, expanding and diversifying our businesses for long-term growth.","While working this change agenda, we have continued to execute consistently on the fundamentals. Since 2009, UnitedHealthcare has consistently taken market share, having grown to serve 4.5 million more people in the U.S., while positioning to serve another 4.5 million people in Brazil. Optum has been formed, aligned, rebaselined and on its way to doubling its 2011 earnings over a 4-year period, significantly increasing its relative contribution to our overall earnings.","At the UnitedHealth Group level, our financial performance has been distinctive in a recessionary environment. Since 2009, revenues have increased $23.5 billion or 27%, operating earnings are up by nearly $3 billion or 46% and net earnings have grown by more than $2 per share from a base of $3.24 per share, an 18% compound growth rate. We have generated cumulative cash flows from operations of more than $20 billion over those past 3 years. We dedicated a portion of this amount to repurchase nearly 200 million shares at an average price of about $43.50 per share, reducing our weighted average shares outstanding by more than 11%.","This is a different company than it was a decade ago, different than just 3 years ago, and it will be predictably different 3 or more years from now. We will remain disciplined in preparing for change in growth. We're established in our markets, growing market share and producing strong and dependable results for shareholders. We expect to continue to serve healthcare providers, governments and consumers, to grow and deliver positive results for investors this year, in 2014 and in the years to come.","So the takeaways this morning in our mind are: strong 2012 performance across the board, 2012 commercial cost trends favorable to forecast, 2013 commercial pricing competitive but better than 2012 for us. We're focused on 2013 growth with outlook in line with our previous guidance. We are working effectively with states, care providers, regulators, the broad group of participants in the healthcare market. And we are preparing for 2014, including the introduction of exchanges in the market.","So thank you for your time this morning. I hope we've been helpful in answering a few questions. But we'd like to hear your areas of interest today. So could we ask the moderator to take this over? And we'll begin to respond to questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to the side of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My question is on the outlook for Medicare Advantage. And just hearing your comments about the pragmatism of the implementation so far, when you look at all of the provisions that are impacting Medicare Advantage in 2014 and '15 in the interest of \"parity\" that seemingly without regard to the supplemental coverage that you're providing for low and moderate income seniors, do you think those provisions, as it stands today, are manageable? Or do you think that they will need to be revised as you move through the next 3 years?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I would say if you're basically saying as it exists today, we would always have an appetite for things that would offer, let's say, more flexibility and more responsiveness in the marketplace for Medicare Advantage. And we would also hold a view that Medicare, in total, would benefit from themes of what I would might call modernization of the program. And we see those things most effectively in the private sector today. So our posture on Medicare Advantage is that we would be advocates of continued change and kind of proactive change around themes of modernization. As it relates to kind of the specifics of the regulations and the elements that are affecting rates and so forth, I think we would prefer things to be somewhat -- to otherwise, but I think that it is manageable as it exists today. We probably don't have -- we think that if -- for things that move further, would really start to impact beneficiaries, affect quality of care, that there would be significant pushback if there were greater activities going forward, as you deal with elements like the fiscal cliff and things like that. I don't know if, Gail, you want to comment or Jack?","Jack Larsen","I think Steve said it right. The only thing that perhaps I might point out, Matt, we certainly always would have a fairly short list of things we perhaps might suggest modification, more modernization of anything. But a lot of the provisions with healthcare reform are things that we are doing more broadly across our business. So for example, a focus on payment for success and outcomes and the like that are embedded in Stars Rating. Those are things that are really good and should be preserved. Would we might have a different point of view on the individual elements? Of course. But I think the bigger things that are in play are things that will ultimately be good for Medicare Advantage and certainly Medicare broadly.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Steve, it seems like you were comfortable in saying that you see no real reason why you wouldn't be able to grow earnings in 2014. Does that relate -- hearing that correctly?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, from this distance and given the opportunities in front of us, yes.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. So outside of the exchange uncertainty, which I think we all understand, can you walk us through your main business segments and let us know anything that you believe would take you off the typical growth path? I know you have a 13% to 16% target. Matt just mentioned Medicare Advantage. Anything you could tell -- anything further you could tell us there, Medicaid, some of the other segments that might be different than what we typically see year-to-year?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, I'm not sure I fully understand the question. But if you're asking what -- again, what gives us a sense of why '14 could represent continued growth and opportunity is that if you look at across the expanse of our businesses over the last several years, as a lot of these elements have been formulating and coming into the marketplace, we have been growing market share, growing in our commercial businesses, growing in Medicare. States have been responding in terms of Medicaid and expanding. The military business is coming online. Our Optum businesses are getting -- really establishing some very positive momentum as they mature. At the same time, their growth opportunities seem to be taking off because of the pressure in the healthcare system in total. And then there is the opportunity to do this all over again in Brazil off a platform that is already market-leading. And that's a pretty good hand to be holding at the moment in particularly in a nation that's looking for positive change and higher performance out of its healthcare system and a population that continues to value high-quality benefits, modernization and innovation that comes to those benefits and costs. So costs matter, and we are all over costs in terms of the focus of our clinical programs, strategies with our networks and so forth. So -- and I think that we are executionally trying to take this enterprise to a next level of performance. So those factors suggest to me that we have as good a chance as anyone of growing and performing in the marketplace.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you expect to grow EBIT next year? Or are you talking about EPS?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'm talking about growing earnings. And I have no interest in giving guidance on '14 at this distance. So you ask me what themes, that's what we responded.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Appreciated some of the comments on the exchanges. And just interested if you can give us some early thoughts on the 3 Rs now that those have come out and whether you think they will be successful in helping to mitigate adverse selection in the exchanges.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So Gail, Dan, you want to...","Daniel Schumacher","Scott, this is Dan Schumacher. I think that the guidance that came out was generally in line with our expectations. With respect to risk adjustment, the only modest changes that when you start sharing, it happens a little later than what I think people were generally thinking. But we do you think it is some level of protection in the new market.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","And the only thing I would add, this is Gail Boudreaux, in terms these comment on exchanges overall, while the 3 Rs are important, the fundamental economics and structure of the exchange is equally important. So as we think about that, the discipline of that analysis, I think, around the exchanges and where you participate makes a lot of -- is very important to us.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick one, just to sort out some of the one-timers that were in the market more for the fourth quarter. Just any insights on sort of the impact of Hurricane Sandy and on utilization in the New York Metro area, and then sort of impact on the flu, if you saw any.","Daniel Schumacher","Sure, Scott. This is Dan again. With respect to the flu, yes, we did see an elevated flu over what we would consider to be normal in the fourth quarter. As we look at that, it added about $50 million of incremental expense beyond what a typical flu is. We did have some moderation with respect to Storm Sandy as well. And we would put all of those things together as well as look at our flu experience through the first 3 weeks of January, we feel comfortable with our trend outlook for 2013.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to the fourth quarter medical cost side. It looks, on a consolidated basis, MLR is up 80 basis points but commercial is flat. I think this is the first quarter in a while where there's sort of a deviation between trends on the government side versus the commercial side. Can you provide any color there? Was there anything in Medicare and Medicaid that's worth sort of highlighting?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Dan?","Daniel Schumacher","Chris, this is Dan again. No, I don't think there's anything to highlight underneath there. The fundamental change in the group loss ratio came down to the change in favorable development year-over-year. And as we look at each of our businesses in the commercial and in government programs, we did have favorable development. However, it was stronger in the commercial business, and that's why you see that difference and the relative change.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then I just want to try to slip one more in here. Earlier in the call, Steve, you talked about fair in the exchanges. I guess, could you just help us understand what would be something unfair in an exchange? Just any kind of detail there would be helpful. I'll leave at that.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, I'm not going to talk about unfair elements. I'll have Gail Boudreaux respond to this. But I think she was sitting on this before in terms of how they really work, kind of the states' postures, the federal posture with respect to making them viable and what we said sustainable markets. Gail?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Steve had sort of 3 things in his comments. One, fair, commercially sustainable and providing us a reasonable return. And as we think about exchanges just a couple of points, I guess, I'd like to start with. One is we see it as a market, not the market. So there will be robust markets inside and outside of the exchange wheel. So expect these -- the rollout to be more measured so that January of '14 is just the beginning. But in terms of your specific question, what makes it more attractive is flexibility. And flexibility around product design, clinical models, network configuration, as well as an ability earn -- to be priced essentially for the risk and earn a fair return. So as we establish and look at exchanges and the viability of those, those are the kinds of factors that are important in assessing those marketplaces.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Optum is a huge part of the growth story over the next couple of years. And it looks like each of your Optum divisions did a bit better than expected exiting the year. Can you talk about some of the major factors that are resulting in Optum divisions doing better than expected? So maybe what's going really well and ahead of expectations entering 2013?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think leadership has a lot to do with it. So Larry, do you want to...","Larry C. Renfro","Sure, I'd be happy to. Christine, it's Larry Renfro. If you go back to last year, I think we laid out a few goals. We talked about, number one, that we were going to have a 15% ROIC by 2015. We were going to have our operating margin at 6% by 2015 and we would double earnings of 2011. As part of that 3-year plan, we dubbed that internally as One Optum. And we had 4 main areas of focus during the year, with financial discipline, reengineering simplification, portfolio management and growth with 5 main drivers: business alignment, business integration, that's one; cost management; organic growth; PBM in-sourcing; and strengthening leadership. I can say that we solidly, from our standpoint, executed and we did it in a simple fashion. So we feel pretty good about 2013. We are pivoting to growth in 2013. But I guess, it just comes down to execution. And again, Christine, we feel pretty good about where we're at today.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Steve, one follow-up. At your Investor Day, you guys said that you see financial services companies, pharmacy retailers, consumer products companies seeking to enter the health insurance market. How should we be thinking about that? We haven't seen new entrants in a while?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I've seen elements of that. I don't know if I could really comment because I don't know what enter the market really means. If they're looking to be a distribution channel, that may be fine. I think that this is an extraordinarily complex space and sometimes the complexity of it is not as apparent to you until you actually get into it. It is also an extraordinarily locally oriented environment. So there -- it is quite a challenge to be effective broadly on a kind of a national scale in healthcare and still be really executing at the Street level. So it's a challenging environment. I think there are actually a lot of competitive barriers-to-entry. And we will see how other nontraditional participants may come into it. I take your point that there has not really been a nontraditional participant enter this marketplace that I can actually think of at least in the time that I've been studying it.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Steve, just want to follow up on the comments you made around the pricing environment. It sounded like you characterized 2013 as a stronger environment. You guys haven't talked about a stronger pricing environment in a long time. So I'm curious, what are the drivers of that? Is that there's less rebate experience that needs to get incorporated? Is it the industry fee or new cost for reform? I'm just curious what exactly stronger pricing environment means and any colors to what's driving that.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. Gail?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. In terms of your question on a stronger pricing environment, I think, first of all, we see it as a stronger pricing environment because we're achieving the yields that we set out and we are able to feel good about our benefit-cost ratio at 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. In terms of the overall environment, Steve said in his comments, it's still competitive. There are a multitude of different drivers in states, and we've talked about that in these calls over the last several quarters. But we think we've got a really strong mix of affordable products in the marketplace that gives us a very broad portfolio to offer to our competitors. And we see that as a driver of giving people options in the marketplace. And I think our cost structure helps us do that. So from that perspective, we've been able to achieve what we set out at Investor Day around the yields that we talked to you about.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up on that, Gail. So I would look at the MLRs that you guys have recorded maybe even specifically in the commercial segment in the last year. And it certainly looks like you were achieving your pricing yields. Or is it more use of extraordinary cost moderation that was not anticipated and this year, you think you're -- I mean, I'm just trying to pare out. Are you actually seeing stronger yields relative to expectations? Is that kind of what we're seeing?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","We're seeing our yields in line with the expectations that we outlined to you at Investor Day and there's also a mix component as you look from '12 to '13. We've put a significant amount of affordable products in the marketplace, and we're seeing strong uptake on those. We saw that in 2012, and that continues into '13. And maybe I'll ask Jeff Alter, who leads our commercial business, to provide some comments as well.","Jeff Alter","I think with Steve's remarks, when we say we see the market, the pricing environment, we're talking predominantly about ourselves. So we still believe the market hasn't changed over the long -- we'll call it the last few quarters. It's competitive. It's rational. We measure, I guess, weakness versus a strongness on our ability to grow and retain membership. And during this season, we've been able to perform better around growth and retention of existing accounts.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So it may be as much around execution as anything else. Maybe we are just executing better this year than we did last. But we seem to be operating in a more rational way with respect to pricing dynamics and we are getting the margins that we are targeting. So I think it's no more complicated than that. And it is profoundly local. Jeff will school me on this regularly that when we talk about these things in generalities, they really come down to market-by-market dynamics.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just want to talk a little bit about the industry tax in 2014. Maybe if you could talk about sort of your initial conversations with employers and maybe even states for sort of pricing of the tax. And in Medicare maybe specifically, your plans to sort of offset that. And if you think that will have any impact on sort of the attractiveness of your product versus fee-for-service Medicare.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I don't know how -- I mean, we're not interested in revealing kind of the inner workings of some of these conversations. Generally speaking, it is a cost and we price to cost. And cost is something that is universally recognized in terms of the elements of these products and in the rate review process. So do you want to -- I think the consensus here is that that's pretty much the issue. It's basically a cost element. All the pieces of the ACA really represent elements of costs that as they're introduced are introduced into the rate approval process and are being discussed, and we think discussed in rational ways in the settings that we are in and regulators who are also trying to achieve their objectives in their respective markets. And for us, so far, those conversations continue to be constructive, professional and we will see where they lead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then is the -- I'm assuming -- I know it's a small portion, but I'm assuming the industry tax in terms of the timing, some of it is going to be in 2013. I'm assuming that's in the guidance range for '13. Again, I know it's a small number. But any help in helping us sort of figure out what that amount is and\/or what percentage of the tax that would represent to you?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think we're feathering it in as it goes through for the year. I don't know if we can actually quantify that for you in a venue like this today. But rest assured that we are -- basically, that is going in on a month-by-month basis as that legislation basically is designed.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And nice job against a lot of headwinds, and also the commentary on the call has been very helpful. I want to focus on something that Gail said at the Investor Day and I think I heard reiterated today. $20 billion of your benefit expense now is pay-for-performance based. And then I think I heard you say that your goal was to get to $50 billion. I have 2 questions about that. It seems that that's a key to success across all of the product offerings, like many of your other activities, not just on the exchanges. But I'm curious about what has to happen differently, either internally or externally, to get to that goal, the timing of that goal. And also what -- how can we quantify or think about the impact on your performance, on your earnings performance, if you get there? Or I should say when.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think that is a great question. We have been at this. Actually, we think much longer than others. We've been in the different names. But the bottom line is it's been the same fundamental theme. We have a lot of elements structurally already in place along these lines, kind of built into our processes. So Gail, do you want to respond?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. So just to reiterate what you said. We are currently at $20 billion of spend in pay-for-performance as part of our accountable care platform. And I think that we shared that at Investor Day how we think about that, which is a broad spectrum of working with physicians, as well as integrated delivery systems around a continuum to meet them where they are, whether that's moving from just straight fee-for-service in the primary care side to including incentives, all the way up through accountable care through integrated pay for delivery full capitation. Our goal is to get to $50 billion by 2017, which is a pretty aggressive goal. We've made significant progress year in and year out. In terms of how we get there, I think it's a concerted effort across UnitedHealthcare, as well as in partnership with Optum. Optum is clearly helping to enable the delivery system with their tools and what they're doing in the marketplace. And on the UnitedHealthcare side, we're working to really change the relationship that we have working with the delivery system. And that's actually happening in each of our local markets. We're embedding it into the core components of what we do. And it's not only on the alignment of the network contracts but it's also our clinical program. We've talked a little bit about our Healthier Lives model at the investor conference, that's an integral part of getting there and what has to change in how we work with the delivery system to managed care, and then on our benefit design and our consumer engagement tool. So I think about all of those, those 4 categories together and how we get there because paying the delivery system differently without changing our internal product design and structure and our internal processes isn't going to get us there. So we look at it in a comprehensive way. So that's how we see it, and how it translates for us, I think, is into the medical cost structure we can offer our clients, the cost of products we put in the marketplace and as you see in '13, the strong, strong growth that we've got in the market. And as I think about even 2013, the strong growth we're seeing across our commercial and Medicare book is indicative of the progress we've already made in some of those fronts.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","So said differently, it enables you to price at a value of the entire package, not just the premium per months but also the value you're getting and the benefit and the access to care that actually makes you well. That, that enables you to gain market share while maintaining your discipline on margins in part.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Yes. I think that's very articulately said.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. But it also gets to the issue of reducing utilization. So if I could ask a follow-up that's only somewhat related, I'll admit. There was a lot of worry and chatter going into the call this morning. What is United going to say about utilization and the utilization trends that you're seeing? And you've addressed that obliquely, I think, in telling us that your cost trend was somewhat below the mid-point of the range or the 5.5% rather, to be precise. But can you give us some commentary on what you're seeing in terms of utilization pattern? And I'm also curious as to whether utilization patterns in the quarter before we go into reform on 2014 might change at all as perhaps benefits change and how you think about that.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Okay. Dan, you want to touch on that?","Daniel Schumacher","Sure. Sheryl, you faded out at the end. But with respect to utilization, our view fundamentally hasn't changed, which is to say that, yes, we did see an increase in utilization in 2012 over 2011. And as we've talked about the categories on past calls, outpatient is higher, physician is pretty stable and inpatient has actually been more restrained. As we look at the full year now, this is the fourth year in a row across all of our benefits businesses we've been able to reduce our bed days per thousand. So we're actually driving out utilization through our programs and through our focus. And so we're very pleased with that result. And with respect to the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit better utilization than we thought, as well as a little bit better unit cost. And it gives us comfort in our forward outlook as we look at our 2013 trend in the 5% to 6% range.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Back into the fourth quarter, looking at the performance of the commercial business versus the consolidated business, it's clear that there's something that happened in the Medicare and the Medicaid business that seems like it got a little worse beyond just the base business. I guess, I'm curious, was there unfavorable TPD in the Medicare and the Medicaid business in this quarter?","Daniel Schumacher","Peter, this is Dan. No, we had favorable development in both commercial, as well as our government programs in the fourth quarter.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Then the current business, did something deteriorate there in those 2 businesses?","Daniel Schumacher","No, it's really -- when you look at the mix of development across the businesses year-over-year, it's that change that's driving that dynamic. From a fundamental standpoint, our performance continues to be strong in both Medicare and Medicaid, despite challenging headwinds with respect to both state and federal pricing.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Would Amil have had a favorable impact on the MLR this quarter?","Daniel Schumacher","It's negligible. When you look at it 2 months on the quarter, not even [ph]. No, it would not.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then just last, just as a follow-up to that. Any commentary about Amil overall and what you think you'll spend there in Brazil over the course of this year for acquisitions and capital spend?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, we wouldn't even talk about that, whether it was in Brazil or the United States. But we can give you some sense of kind of how things are settling out in Amil.","David S. Wichmann","Yes, Peter, it's Dave Wichmann. Thanks for the question. I'll try to give you some information. It's very early stages, as you well know. We did close a transaction, the first part of the transaction at the very end of October. We also -- you probably heard that we're in market doing some open market purchases of the public stock to the extent that it was below the BRL 30.75 offer price that we had offered. So we were successful at doing some of that during -- in the November time frame. We're preparing for the tender right now for the remaining public shares, and we expect to complete that tender still in the first half of 2013. That is on track, as we have laid out both in the call around Amil as well as in the investor conference. And just as a reminder, we'll be financing that with debt. It's about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion to complete that transaction. And just generally, I mean, Amil's results are good. They have posted about $1 billion in revenues. So for the 2 months in '12, was solidly ahead on both medical and dental enrollment for the quarter, which we are pleased with. And as you'd expect, the earnings, a net of minority interests are very insignificant to the quarter. And that's what we expected, given both the -- what we expected from the business as well as the purchase accounting applications to that as well.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","To follow on the exchange comments, with your view now of the fundamentals and the 3 Rs, how are you thinking about the mix of small group versus individual markets that you may participate in for the 10 to 25 that you had mentioned earlier? And I'm assuming that excludes private exchanges. And then for the larger states, like California and New York, how likely are those to be broken up into MSAs as opposed to statewide exchanges? And last question on that topic, as I appreciate the breakout of the 10% individual and small group exposure, but I wanted to look at exchange exposure a different way. There's several reports suggesting employers of low-wage, low-skill employees like retail or restaurants are more likely to dump into the exchanges. So what is the exposure across your commercial risk book to those types of employers of low-wage, low-skill workers?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well. So I'll offer a couple of responses. A lot of those that you just mentioned in the latter part aren't covering benefits at all today. So those would be the ones that most of the marketplace look to be added to the exchanges. I would also offer that kind of the gravitational pull of our whole enterprise is towards the small group side. We have never been large players in the individual marketplace. I don't know if you want to comment.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Yes. The only other thing I'd add to Steve's comment -- this is Gail Boudreaux, is specifically to is this just public or private exchanges, we will participate broadly in public exchanges. We already -- or private exchanges, I'm sorry. We already do. And we see that as another distribution channel. We've been very effective over a number of years doing that. And our subsidiary, Optum, also has some significant opportunities in the private exchange marketplace. So that's a nice growth opportunity for us going forward.","John S. Penshorn","This is John Penshorn, Sarah. We did not count the private exchanges in those broad range totals that Steve offered as a starting point.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the part on whether or not you think larger states like California and New York might break up the exchanges into something smaller than statewide, is that something that you're looking into?","Jeff Alter","Sarah, it's Jeff Alter. It's tough to comment only on what we know publicly. New York has already indicated that there will be multiple geographic-based exchanges there. And so we at least know one state is thinking more than just a single exchange.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the exchange commentary. I guess, two points here. First, in the context of provider rates that you're negotiating. I guess, what percentage of contracts do you have signed yet? And what rates are you kind of zeroing in on? You mentioned that this product serves the partition between Medicaid and commercial. Are you seeing pricing kind of skew towards one of those ranges? And then also, as far as the commentary with the states goes, I appreciate you're looking for more clarity. It makes a lot of sense. Is there a sense for the timing around when that clarity may come into view? And as far as the federal exchange, is there a sense that, that will be a very uniform exchange? Or will they allow for flexibility to account for state variances?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","This is Gail Boudreaux. Let me address your multiple questions, hopefully in order. First, around the pricing issue. As we said a couple of times, the exchanges we see very much as a local market dynamic. So from a pricing perspective, we see that going anywhere from commercial rates to something less. And our goal is to match our underlying economics to each of the exchanges. So we're in the process of doing that. As you know, we already offer multiple products with multiple networks constructs, and we've been doing that for a number of years. And we've aligned our payment and our network construct to the product offerings in those markets. So we're going to leverage that history. That's our experience in building networks broadly across the United States, to match the markets. And as you think about it, remember that we have to acknowledge that our products inside the exchange will also be available outside of the exchange. So that expertise will be important in building our overall network construct and offering it in the exchange. In terms of your other 2 questions, I don't know that we have great visibility or speculation on the timing of when those regulations will come out. We're obviously working really closely with our states. We have a dedicated team in place that meets with each of our markets, and we're preparing our own business to be able to support what does come out. So I don't have any great visibility into the timing of the other 2 questions at this stage.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And that's 50 different timetables. So very -- again, these are very local dynamics. We have maybe time for 2 more questions.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to get a perspective on your margin outlook for 2013 in the Medicare business. When you had the Investor Day, you had the rates for 2013, you had your own Star scores and what the margin expectations would be based on that. But since then, you've seen your enrollment and disenrollment data and your mix of business possibly relative to your competition and then one more quarter of utilization. Do you see it being flat year-over-year on an MLR basis? Is it likely to get worse or better?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, we really don't provide margin insight with respect to Medicare other than the most general themes. So Jack, do you want to comment at that level?","Jack Larsen","Ana, Jack Larsen. As Steve said, we don't comment specifically on margin trends in Medicare. But what I can tell you is that based on the enrollment season that we're just finishing up here effective January 1, the mix of new members that we're seeing is very much in keeping with the mix that we had anticipated in terms of individuals already in Medicare versus new to Medicare. We're really not seeing anything surprising or what we had anticipated. So on that one, I'd say we feel very good about the guidance that we offered back in November.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","In terms of the age cohorts, are you seeing more of the 65 to 67 type, the younger age mix, enrolling directly into Medicare Advantage and any mix shift likely on the 75 plus?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes. That has historically been the pattern. Jack?","Jack Larsen","Yes. So exactly right. I think we are very aware of the cohort mix. And as I said, we're seeing what we had anticipated with really nothing remarkable to offer.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then on the Part D side, with your new product, can you comment on your margin expectations relative to what you had even directionally in 2012? And then from a seasonality perspective, as you're guiding us to a quarterly progression, would there likely be any change?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, we don't comment on the margins with respect to that as well. We're very comfortable with where we put our bids. We have got nice market response. The switch to an enhanced plan to open up a new basic plan was a very good move. But it just moves the recognition of earnings under those programs to the back half of the year. And that's -- the geography of when the earnings come in is really the biggest change in there. Other than that, we've had a very good Part D season and put forward our bids in what we think is a very rational fashion. And I think we will be very comfortable of that. And then on the downstream impact is that it should drive a script volume to OptumRx, and that will be a positive for us as well. So that's I think all we could comment on it.","Operator","And we'll go last to the side of David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I'm focused on Optum. Your margins have had really nice improvements sequentially for the last few quarters. End of the year, above where your guidance range is for next year. I was hoping if you could comment on perhaps what other than maybe seasonality might be the reasons that, that will be lower than where you ended the fourth quarter. Second, could you comment on any early, say, operational feedback on the internalization of the Medco business? And finally, give us a sense of how quickly you can get Optum services into the Amil market and customer base?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. Well, that will be our last 3 questions then. And Larry, maybe you want to start off?","Larry C. Renfro","Yes. Okay. David, what was the first question? I got the last 2.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Basically, the margins at Optum, that whether the fourth quarter is seasonally driven, et cetera.","Larry C. Renfro","I think in Steve's opening remarks, he talked about that we do have seasonality at Optum. So obviously, the first quarter, second quarter, the first half of the year, I think we gave an estimate that, that would be about 40%, 60% in the latter part of the year. That was a trend in 2012. We believe that will be -- will remain the trend in 2013. So what we're trying to do, David, is balance investments and growth with financial discipline. So we're comfortable with our plan. We're comfortable with the 3-year plan and how this all fits. But I think you're going to see that seasonality over the year. If I move into the second area, and I'll ask Dirk to comment on this as well, when it comes to the PBM in-sourcing, I think you know that was a very large undertaking over the past couple of years. And I'm going to address that on 2 fronts. The first front will be the technology, the operating platforms, the infrastructure. And I can tell you that as we progress through the year last year, we met our targets. We delivered on that. And Dirk will talk about the conversion that's gone seamless in the first quarter. The second part of the PBM, as we were getting into the commercial business, was our external sales. And I just want to comment that we kept going with sales as well with, I think, we mentioned at our Investor Day that we have made 50 deals at that point in time, about half of those deals come from the national account side, the UHC, and the other half are independent external sales. And it probably represents about 1 million new members. So maybe Dirk you can comment on your thoughts.","Dirk McMahon","Yes. So on the commercial migration. We just completed our first migration wave with 400,000 consumers moved from the ESI\/Medco platform to our platform, plus all commercial new business. And that's gone pretty well. We're excited. Actually right now, we sort of shifted gears and are thinking about the next migration wave, which is on 4\/1. So the first wave sort of out of the blocks, looking forward to the more conversions. On the sales side, all I would add is that we saw in 2012 extremely strong RFP season. We actually didn't have enough people to answer all the RFPs. We've staffed up in 2013 to be able to handle all that volume.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And Dave, maybe Amil?","David S. Wichmann","Sure. If you don't mind, I'm just going to take it up a level because it's very early stage right now. We've just begun our planning for the integration work that were doing with Amil. As you might suspect, most of that planning is really around the growth opportunities that exist in Brazil and possibly more broadly in the South American markets. Areas of focus for us are really in operations and technology. We think we can add a lot to Amil's platform in that respect. Growth, which is again the opportunity that exists in Brazil, and again, more broadly in South America. Clinical areas, and I think that's reciprocal. They are very confident clinically and we're very confident at managing managed care populations at our network. So a nice sharing there. And then really around infrastructure and compliance, as you might suspect as well. Certainly, many of the growth opportunities we see are for Optum. But as I said, we're just beginning to plan those activities now. Certainly, pharmacy is one of those that we are looking at carefully. And broadly, I'd just say we see great opportunity in Brazil and South America also for the benefits business. And having just been there last week, just reaffirms the terrific platform that we acquired. So we're looking forward to the opportunities of the future.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thanks. So thank you for joining us today. To kind of sum up today's discussion, in 2012, the UnitedHealth Group continued the steady growth trajectory, delivered consistently in terms of strong fundamental execution, innovation, adaptability. It is a changing marketplace, and we think we have resources to respond and adapt. While it's still early in the new year, we're well positioned to leverage our capabilities, expand our position in the marketplace. And then from 2013, we are off to a strong start in January. So we look to the -- positively to the future in terms of what we offer the marketplace, as well as what the demands of the Affordable Care Act, the Accountable Care Act will represent in terms of opportunities for '14 and '15. So we thank you for your attention, and we'll see you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time."],"21217":["UnitedHealth Group, Inc.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Please go ahead.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our company's second quarter performance. For our full year 2016, both UnitedHealthcare and Optum continue to grow at a vibrant pace. The outlook for net earnings, cash flows and return on capital remain strong and consistent with our recent commentary.","The steady advancement of innovative, market-responsive products, services and experiences has led to balanced organic gains across virtually all of our businesses. We believe our businesses remain well-positioned for continued broad-based growth for the balance of 2016, for 2017 and in the years to come. As we reflect on this quarter's performance, we once again see exceptional growth, improved customer retention, and important new business awards and opportunities, leading to continued advances in both revenue backlog and sales pipelines.","For second quarter 2016, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 28.2% year-over-year to $46.5 billion, with all domestic lines posting double-digit growth, as we grew to serve 132 million unique individuals. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 per share grew 13.3% year-over-year. Medical cost trends remain steady and consistent with the outlook we shared as we began the year, and operating costs remain well-controlled.","Last quarter, we updated you on our intent in 2017 to participate in only a handful of ACA-compliant individual markets, what we referred to as the exchange market. That effort is on track, and we do not expect any meaningful financial exposure on 2017 business from the three or fewer exchange markets where we currently plan to remain.","Our second quarter includes an incremental $200 million in full year 2016 exchange market losses fully absorbed in these results. Along with what we absorbed last quarter, first half 2016 results reflect an incremental $325 million in full year losses beyond the expectation established as we entered the year.","Looking at the company overall, we intend to carry strong 2016 business momentum into 2017 that will include investing in and improving our competitiveness for the years beyond 2017. We will balance these investments with our commitment to provide returns to shareholders through growth in earnings per share and dividends. We will lay out a strongly positive and detailed view of 2017 later this year and address questions at that time.","We'll now turn the call to Larry Renfro to discuss Optum's strong second quarter performance, then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and the UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Optum's second quarter results continued to build on the exceptional growth trends, earning results and operating performance metrics we have achieved for the last several years. Second quarter revenues exceeded $20 billion, increasing 52% over last year. OptumRx revenues expanded 69% to $15.1 billion. OptumHealth and OptumInsight combined grew their top line to $5.8 billion, growth of 20% over last year.","Optum earned more than $1.2 billion in the second quarter with all segments reporting earnings growth of 20% or more. First half 2016 earnings from operations exceeded $2.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first half 2015, an increase of 47%. As expected, first half 2016 earnings results represent just over 40% of Optum's full year outlook.","OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 15% or $1.5 billion to $7.3 billion, with growth particularly strong in revenue management, technology and government services. OptumHealth grew to over 80 million consumers, up 6% over last year, while OptumRx is tracking well to its target of managing 1 billion adjusted scripts this year.","The pipeline of opportunities we are discussing with existing and prospective customers are increasingly more strategic. We are being asked to help fundamentally change and improve core business operations, rather than simply respond to traditional RFPs or single-point solutions. Today the average award size for OptumHealth and OptumInsight is more than double what it was just a few years ago. And Optum's qualified sales pipeline continues to grow strongly in both opportunity size and quality.","Last quarter, we discussed with you, in some detail, our vision for the next-generation pharmacy care services business. So far this year, OptumRx has been honored to receive new external business awards for January 2017, covering more than 1.7 million people, an increase of 40% over last year's sales result at this point in the year and the selling season continues. Sophisticated buyers are embracing our modern and innovative approaches to data and proprietary analytics, consumer engagement and service, specialty pharmacy and clinical programs that integrate to improve overall patient health.","A second high potential area is the health financial services market. Independent estimates project market growth of more than 20% per year, as the number of people using health benefit accounts expands and their account balances increase. Optum's health financial services business aligns with the company's efforts to help consumers navigate and use the entire healthcare system more effectively.","Optum Financial Services serves consumers through 3 million health financial accounts with approximately $7 billion in assets under management by year end 2016. And there are expanding opportunities in this area and others to simplify the consumer health care experience, incent prevention and wellness, and provide consumers with deeper insights and more control, as they seek to optimize their personal health and manage their health-related finances throughout their lives.","The consistent theme in these examples and in Optum's performance quarter-by-quarter is that customers are embracing Optum's innovative approaches to making health care work better. We bring the market four things: seasoned people; experienced operators committing to helping solve our clients' complex challenges; proven technology, specifically technology-enabled solutions and tools to power clients' processes and operations; unique data assets and analytics, we help clients gain insights to make better decisions and take better actions on multiple levels; action and results. We have the flexibility and focus to respond quickly and execute our task accurately for those we serve.","Optum is uniquely positioned to serve as a valuable data-enabled health services company in a growing $1 trillion global marketplace, a company serving all stakeholders across the health care system: consumers, health plans, life science companies, governments, employers and health care providers.","Now, let me turn it over to Dave.","David Scott Wichmann - President","Thank you, Larry. Broad, diversified growth and strong forward momentum also continued at UnitedHealthcare again this quarter. UnitedHealthcare is passionate about modernizing and enriching the consumer experience and continues to advance new approaches to simplify that experience for the people we serve.","Second quarter Medicare & Retirement revenues grew nearly 14% to $14.3 billion. Strong retention and growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement yielded net growth of nearly 0.5 million people year-to-date. Growth in Medicare is being driven by dependable products that offer clear value and serve people in simple and caring ways. For instance, while seniors are on the phone with us for other reasons, we will encourage and schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors' appointments for them this year. Home visits by our house call nurses will be up 20% year-over-year to over 1.2 million in 2016.","Activities such as these, along with consistent approaches around benefits, products, network engagement and tailored service meaningfully improve care quality, the consumer experience and customer retention. From these and other activities, we expect to serve a significantly higher percentage of our Medicare Advantage members through four-star plans in 2017. This was a big lift by our people and care delivery partners. And I am grateful to all of them for what they have achieved on behalf of those we serve.","Strong organic growth continues in Medicaid as well, with revenues up 14.7% to $8.3 billion as UnitedHealthcare community and state served 225,000 more people in the second quarter. This past quarter's growth includes new members in Iowa and expanded services in New York. And we were awarded additional markets in Pennsylvania for next year, as part of that state's program expansion. Importantly, Medicaid revenue growth also reflects a stronger mix as states continue to ask us to help them serve more people with more complex healthcare needs.","We now serve nearly 5.7 million people through state-sponsored health care programs, and we expect that growth to continue as we advance innovations to help states better serve their most complex and higher-cost citizens, meeting their needs with more integrated social services built around their health.","Our Employer & Individual business revenues also grew 14% to $13.5 billion in the second quarter. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve nearly 400,000 more people in commercial benefits through the first six months of the year outside of the exchange market products. This is strongly favorable to the initial growth forecasts for both self-funded and full-risk offerings.","Turning to medical costs, we reported a care ratio of 82% this quarter, which is 30 basis points year-over-year \u2013 a 30 basis point year-over-year increase, primarily due to adverse exchange market performance and the relative levels of claim reserve development in the quarter, offset by strong underlying core performance by the rest of our UnitedHealthcare businesses.","Year-to-date, favorable prior-year reserve development was $300 million as compared to $130 million in the first half of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, reserves developed unfavorably by $100 million. Of this, $60 million relates to items that predate 2016 and do not impact 2016 core medical trends, such as 2013 and 2014 Medicaid and Medicare true-ups and settlements. The current year portion of development relates to exchange market products. Beyond this component, the current year development in the second quarter was favorable.","Commercial medical trend remains consistent with the original outlook of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Hospital inpatient admissions per person are lower year-over-year across all UnitedHealthcare businesses. Like most years, there are pockets of higher cost trends, including specialty pharmacy and the increasing use of ER and outpatient services this year. Overall, health care cost trends remain in line and controlled.","Bringing these items together, in the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues by $4.5 billion or 13.6% on a year-over-year basis. The business grew by 320,000 domestic consumers in the quarter and has added more than 1.6 million consumers year-to-date. UnitedHealthcare generated nearly $2 billion in operating earnings in the quarter despite the pressures from exchange market products and the second-quarter prior-year reserve development we just described.","Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has delivered steady, distinguished organic growth consistently for more than half a decade, and here's how we're doing it. We help people achieve better health by using our data and analytics to simplify decision-making and to help them access the care they need. We work with physicians and hospitals, sharing information to help them make fact-based decisions about the care they provide. And we focus every day on improving the quality of our execution in every interaction and process for the people we engage with and serve, as well as those who provide their care. UnitedHealthcare, still with only a modest national share in a growing health care benefits market, expects to drive further growth by delivering on these commitments better and better every day, every quarter and every year.","Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, cash flows from operations in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or about 1 times net income compared to 0.7 times net income in the year-ago period. Year to date, cash flow from operations of $4 billion was 1.2 times net income, also ahead of last year's pace. The company repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the first half of 2016. Our Board of Directors increased the dividend in June by 25% to an annual rate of $2.50 per share. We will return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders in dividends payments in the next 12 months. The debt-to-total-capital ratio declined to 48%, and we expect it will continue to decline in the second half of this year, as we work back to a target in the 40% range.","Reflecting on performance for the first six months of 2016, overall growth and results have been favorable across the businesses. However, our exchange market growth is also above our original estimates, as are the corresponding losses. Prudently balancing this overall performance, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.80 to $7.95 from the former $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We believe this to be an appropriate posture, given the performance backdrop of the exchange business, even as the core businesses have performed strongly.","As we consider the balance of 2016, we expect the combination of cost to set up new businesses for \u2013 new business for 2017 and ongoing investments in growth areas such as MedExpress, OptumCare and International, along with strong seasonal fourth quarter earnings performance from Optum, will produce approximately equal adjusted earnings per share results in each of the last two quarters of this year.","Steve?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Dave. As we have discussed in recent conversations, we believe we are in the early stages of a unique era for UnitedHealth Group, looking ahead toward what may be the best and most important decade of performance for this enterprise. We serve growing markets that are seeking better performance in health care, both in the U.S. and globally. We continue to strengthen and align enterprise capabilities to meet these needs. And we are intensely focused on the quality and consistency of the experience we deliver to our consumers, customers, benefit sponsors and care providers.","On this latter point, we have the opportunity to evolve and differentiate our enterprise in the coming years by focusing intensely on redefining the quality and value of the health care experience for those we serve, and importantly, objectively measuring the impact of these efforts and recalibrating and enhancing our performance as we advance. With this focus, paired with evolving capabilities and the strong market positions of our growing diversified portfolio of businesses, we expect to drive differentiated growth for years to come. These efforts will help people live healthier lives and make health systems work better for everyone. As a company, we're committed to making the most of this period of opportunity.","We thank you for your interest today. And, operator, let's open up for some questions. One question per person, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Again, we ask you limit to one question per person, so we can get to as many participants as possible. We'll take the first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Could you just give us, sorry, maybe some visibility on how you're handling the Medicare Advantage bids for 2017? I know the information is not public yet, but if you can just talk to directionally how much of the ACA fee suspension you've loaded into benefits versus reserving for other internal initiatives or earnings?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I think our orientation is to really make sure that we are serving the interests of seniors. Steve, do you want to touch on that?","Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement","Sure. Good morning, Matt. Steve Nelson.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement","Yes. So, as you pointed out, it is a bit early to provide any detail, but I can give you some high-level perspective and direction. We clearly want to build on the momentum that we're experiencing right now in 2016. So, our objective is to continue to offer stability in our benefits, including premiums.","There will be some enhancements where we think that's appropriate. It's obviously a market-by-market conversation, but overall, stability in both benefits and premiums. And this is driven in large part by the great improvement that we've been experiencing in our Star performance, particularly for 2017. And then we're going to continue on the innovations around the member experience for clinical programs. And we think this well positions us for growth in both the individual and the group Medicare Advantage products, and particularly, in the group side, experiencing really strong sales and retention for 2017.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Just \u2013 sorry, go ahead.","Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement","With respect to the insurance fee and as a moratorium there, I think it's important to think about that in the context of the overall funding equation. As you know, this program has been underfunded, 14% rate cut since 2010 and continues to be underfunded relative to medical costs. So, our goal, as Steve mentioned, is to provide stability and valuable benefits to the seniors. And it's a very effective program that continues to drive costs down and improve outcomes, and satisfaction is really high.","So our perspective and our approach has been, after we take this into the overall funding equation, we're going to share a portion of it, obviously, with the provider partners and employer groups in the group MA space, and then passing on a meaningful amount to our members in the form of stable benefits, and again, enhancing where we can. So, I think, that provides a perspective. And again, we're just \u2013 we're really feeling great about the position of this business and the opportunities as we head into 2017 and beyond.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And it's a great question, but it's just a little early in terms of going too far into it, so...","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Can I just one follow-up? Okay, never mind. I know you got a lot of people. Go ahead.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we can cover these off-line, Matt, through the course of the day.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right, yeah.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the exchanges. Two things here. One, I know you're broadly exiting, but wanted to get more detail on what happened here in terms of a postmortem. Maybe Dan can walk us through how the initial $400 million of losses was set when you originally realized the problem for 2016, and what the company has seen to \u2013 that has driven the loss to be about double that over the last six months or so?","And then just lastly, you're running more than $500 million of losses, give or take, in this segment for 2016 in terms of what you've reported for this year. Can we simply add that number back to the 2016 reported earnings to get the true run rate to jump off for 2017 for Steve's strong earnings number for next year, or are there some other adjustments we need to think about? Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, Dan, do you want to take him through the math?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning.","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","The question was comprehensive. So, just to re-baseline on the individual ACA. Our expectation coming into the year was that on a policy-year basis, we would lose somewhere in the area of $525 million. We had done a premium deficiency reserve at the end of the year of $245 million to partially offset that. So, the net of those two was about a $280 million impact to 2016 earnings performance.","And then in the first quarter, we strengthened that or increased the loss expectation by $125 million, and then likewise, added an additional $200 million in the second quarter fully recognized in the quarter in terms of the expectation of the full year. So, when you put that all together, it's a shade over $600 million of P&L impact to 2016.","As you look at what's driving the increase inside that, so for the quarter, the $200 million that we've added, it's a combination of two things. It's really more volume and higher consumption. And I'd break it down, about a third of that is higher volume. So, we've got higher sales as well as more moderate attrition than we had expected. And then two-thirds is really around the consumption. And, obviously, we had unfavorable development on our exchanges relating to the first quarter in the second quarter. That came with higher second quarter costs, and we've also let that inform our full year outlook. So, two-thirds of that $200 million really relates to the underlying consumption.","And what's changing underneath that, to your question, the reality is the severity of chronic conditions inside the population actually increased on a year-over-year basis. If you look at the prevalence of chronic disease, things like HIV and Hepatitis C, diabetes, COPD. Those are examples of things that the prevalence was high to begin with in 2015, and that has increased into 2016. So, that's what's informing our view.","As you think about 2017, I would tell you, of that $605 million on the math I went through previously, a good meaningful portion of that will contribute to our 2017 performance. Some of the things offsetting that are certainly some semi-variable and fixed costs associated with this business that don't go away as we shrink our footprint in 2017.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan. That's, I think, a great response. So next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to circle back to comments around the negative prior-year development. You mentioned that it was driven in part by Medicare and Medicaid settlements related to 2013 and 2014. What is that, exactly? And it seems like an unusually long lag time for a true-up, so if you could just talk us through that.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Dan, do you want to touch on that?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Sarah. Well, first and foremost, I'd tell you that there are certainly a lot of inherent estimates in our business, and as a result, there's lots of pluses and minuses in any given quarter, so when you look at the portfolio of things that resolve in a given quarter, there are always some things that change period to period.","As it relates to second quarter, as Dave mentioned, we experienced $100 million of unfavorable reserve development, and that was split 60% on the prior year, and 40% on the current year. As you look at that prior-year element, there isn't anything individually large. There's a collection of things. And I'd tell you, that was a blend of some old provider settlements as well as, as Dave mentioned, some government true-ups, some of them dating back three years, particularly around Part D as you resolve the intersection between claims and corridors and reinsurance, and programs inside that.","So, those are the things that contributed to that prior-year element. Importantly, though, those are all things that frankly don't have any bearing on our current year medical trend and medical outlook. And as it relates to the current year component, that obviously \u2013 with more than all of that was related to the individual ACA book of business. Absent that, we actually had favorable development related to the current year in the quarter. But important when you put it all together, from a medical cost perspective as well as a trend perspective, outside of the individual ACA, we continue to track in line with our expectations across the platform.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And some of it has to relate to how long it takes for the benefit sponsors and the administrations to actually get the final data, so you can actually get resolution.","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Absolutely.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. First, just quick question is just on the exchange update. Where did you end up in terms of exchange lives in 2Q, and what does your updated loss forecast assume in terms of attrition for the rest of the year?","And then just a second follow-up question, just on OptumRx, looks like you're actually annualizing now to over $60 billion of revenue annualized in the first half. So, how are you thinking about the full year revenue guidance? I think, most recently it was at $58 billion, but it seems like you're \u2013 or at least annualizing well ahead of that so far in the first half of the year. Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So that's an interesting two-part combination. So, Dan, do you want to take the first part?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Sure, Scott. On the exchange enrollment, we ended the quarter with 820,000 lives in the exchange, so that's up about 25,000 from what we expected \u2013 or from what we ended the first quarter at. As we look to where we expect to perform over the balance of the year, we expect that to moderate through attrition and land somewhere in the zone of about 750,000 lives, as we close the year out. And then, obviously, with the \u2013 2017, we would expect a very meaningful reduction in that.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And OptumRx?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Scott, it's Larry Renfro. I'm going to start, and then I'm going to ask Tami Reller. Tami is the new CFO at Optum, and she's going to make a couple of comments here. So, I'm just going to talk a little bit about the Rx business for a second. We've been in business with Catamaran for about a year right now. And when we did that \u2013 we had a lot of reasons we did the business, and a couple of them, I thought, might be important to call out in regard to your question. And one was around the complementary strengths that we had. And that was the retail and the mail focus, and those business coming together as well as payers and employers coming together. But probably the most complementary was the technology, and we've been able to get that put that in place.","The value proposition, and that's what I think you're starting to see now, the expanded services, the scale, as well as synchronization is starting to take hold, and it's resonating in the industry. So, we believe we're building a sound business, and you know how that works. So, we've had a good first half. We have hit all the metrics and are set up pretty well for the second half. And so, I'll let Tami comment on that.","Tami L. Reller - Chief Financial Officer, Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","That's great. Good. And I would just reiterate that integration is going well, new business is going well, renewals, all going very well, so we appreciate the question on the business.","The one thing I would just note, too, is that we had a number of items that we noted in the December investor conference on elements that would affect both revenue and \u2013 as well as scripts, and that has to do with Part D enrollment, as well as one of our large clients moving to an administrative-only relationship and then also the well-known co-op closures. So, some of those elements do have an impact as we go forward throughout the year, but again, remain confident in the OptumRx business overall for the year.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Go next to A. J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. I think I'll just ask broadly about capital deployment from here. Obviously, you're coming up on the anniversary of the Catamaran deal, where you step back from the share buyback activity, been running about $500 million a quarter, which is less than previous.","At what point do you think you might step that back up? And then also, just on general acquisitions and opportunities for transactions there, can you give us any thoughts on the availability of deals, and your thoughts about where you're focused?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think we'll address the capital allocation, but I would not get your hopes up that we're going to give you too much guidance about where we're focused, things like that, I think, as you might suspect. So, John, do you want to cover capital?","John Franklin Rex - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Good morning, A. J. It's John Rex here. So, just thinking about \u2013 ways to answer your question here. So, yeah, we've repurchased about 1 billion shares \u2013 about $1 billion worth of stock year to date. That's against the guidance we had for $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So, you should expect that the repurchasing activity will moderate meaningfully in the second half of the year.","And Dave had a bit commented in his portion of the script, we're also committed to continuing to bring down our debt-to-total-capital ratio back ultimately to our approximately 40% target range. So, we're just slightly below 48% here, as we exited the Q2. And so we'd expect to continue to focus on meeting those commitments and bringing down that debt-to-capital ratio. So, that's how you kind of think about it in terms of progression and capital.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And as it relates to M&A, I mean, we have a clear business model. We continue to be focused on building that out. We talked in the past about allocating capital to cultivate capabilities that we think are important for the future. And we tend to be careful with respect to how we consider our timing and values. So, I don't think any of those things that had been long-standing attributes really changed. And so, we'll \u2013 we continue to be attentive to the marketplace, but beyond that, I don't think we can give you much.","Next question, please.","Operator","We go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It's going to be kind of a broad question, but I'm curious about what you're seeing going on with drug price trend going on now. If we look at your bids, you've won some business with OptumRx, some very sizable accounts, including one where your pricing shows up in publicly filed information, where you can see that your view on trend is a little bit below where some of the competitors are by 0.5% or 1.5%.","So, can you tell us what you think is going on with drug price trend and with the various regulation that's coming out or that might come out on drug pricing? And where do you see all that evolving going forward over the next year or two?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we'll comment from a PBM point of view, and then maybe broadly in terms of the pressure on elevating drug prices broadly, particularly, in the specialty categories. Mark?","Mark A. Thierer - Chief Executive Officer, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Good morning, Peter. Well, drug prices are the first item, obviously, on our clients' list. And, I think, if you look at how we're attacking this, this last quarter has been a real differentiator for us. As Larry said, the combination here for us was all about scale. And it is intended to take to the supply chain. So, as a much bigger business, we're talking about drug pricing every day to the biotech companies and to the pharmaceutical companies bringing product to the market.","And the way we contract with them is to protect our clients as best we can from some of these price increases. Obviously, price can be addressed by regulatory issues, but also just by better management of the drug benefits. So, we use our tools like formulary, like specialty steerage, like preferred and exclusionary networks, to drive price down. And in large part, this is what's defining us right now.","We've reached a scale where we've obviously taken the drug spend that we manage for our clients to the supply chain and a differentiated model to drive down and contain to the best of our ability drug prices. And so rather than talk on a political stage about how to get after drug pricing, we're using the tools that we've deployed here and integrating them with better medical management in the broader Optum chassis.","So, we do think we have a differentiated model, a better way to get after drug price and drug cost management, combining both the technology platform that Larry talked about and, really, the leading clinical management platform in the broader Optum. So, that's what we're doing.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please?","Operator","Next question is from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So, maybe if you could discuss a little bit more how you see the Medicaid pipeline opportunity, involving both near term and longer term, maybe even including the Pennsylvania and LTSS RFP. Dave in his prepared remarks said he expect to grow, so what's giving you confidence about your ability to continue to win RFPs going forward? And then just real quick, how are Iowa costs running versus the losses assumed in the PVR? Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Austin?","Austin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Thanks for the question. First of all, as far as the pipeline, I think we've mentioned a couple of times earlier in the year, we see very robust pipeline. We expect to respond to about 20 RFPs this year that'll be implemented over the next three years. Many of those, and I think this is a really important piece, continue to include, and Dave mentioned this in his comments, more and more populations with complex needs. That gives us an awful lot of confidence, because when you look at the combined capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that really is in our wheelhouse. That's really where we can provide tremendous amount of value to the consumer as well as our state partners. So, we see that continuing.","The Pennsylvania LTSS opportunity is just one example of that. We'll see Virginia as another example of that, Oklahoma another example, so you're going to see a continued increase in these very costly populations.","Keep in mind when you back up and look at the macro story here, you've got $500 billion of spend in the Medicaid space. You got about 70% of the membership in managed care today, but only about 41% of the dollars. So, when you talk about confidence in the pipeline and opportunity to grow, that's really where that opportunity sits. Couple with that still some greenfield states. There are 15 states that don't have managed care today, some very large, like North Carolina, where we've been successful in working with the state to get legislation passed, and that market will continue to develop. So, again, I think, it squares up very nicely with our capabilities and marks the road for a very good growth opportunity going forward.","In regard to Iowa, first and foremost, we're very pleased with the implementation. It's been going very well. We stay very focused on job one, which is taking care of the folks we've been entrusted to do so. And we did build a very good relationship with the state. As you know, it's \u2013 we're one quarter in, so it's very early, so too early to really comment on what we're seeing. Early indications would be that it's in line with our expectations, but, again, very early.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. Next?","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line's open.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Just was hoping to get some more clarification on Dave's comments about the drivers of medical cost trend. I guess, just generally, when you made your comments about specialty pharma, ER and outpatient and then inpatient, is that inclusive of the ACA exchange membership?","And then more importantly, is it fair to say that the specialty pharma, emergency room, outpatient are trending higher than you initially expected, and that's being offset by inpatient? Or just any comment would be helpful. Thanks a lot.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Dan?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Good morning, Chris. Dan Schumacher. So, first and foremost, just as a reminder, coming into the year, our expectation was for a moderate increase in underlying utilization trend. That's what informed our pricing, our entire benefit planning as well as the guidance we've provided. And that's what we were able to manage to in the second quarter, very consistent with our conversation in the first quarter and very much in line with our expectation.","It's kind of looking at how trends progress through the year. Typically, we talk in annual terms. But as we look to the quarters, we certainly don't view Q2 use as having accelerated beyond the Q1 rate. If anything, I'd probably tell you that Q2 is perhaps a little bit lower.","To your questions about the categories themselves, the bigger drivers of our trend are certainly in pharmacy and outpatient, as Dave mentioned, and then working against that is more moderate levels of trend, as we drive down per capita use on an inpatient basis. The pharmacy piece, I will tell you that's largely driven by Hepatitis C. So, we changed our coverage criteria effective 1\/1 of 2016 in our commercial business, so we expanded coverage. And that's what's really driving that 8% to 9% pharmacy trend on a commercial basis that we talked about back at the investor conference.","And then if you look to the outpatient side, inside there, we see elevated levels of emergency room. Surgical procedures are contributing, also facility-based \u2013 facility-dispensed prescriptions, so that's kind of oriented more around the oncology space. So, those are some of the bigger contributors, and not surprisingly, that is absolutely where our medical management efforts are focused to work down those costs.","All of those categories, I will tell you, are within the ranges that we expressed at the investor conference, probably a little bit higher on the outpatient side, in line in the pharmacy space, a little bit better on the inpatient side, but net-net, we still expect, on a commercial basis, our full year medical trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks a lot.","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","You bet.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please?","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. So, Larry, I was wondering if you could update us on what you're seeing in terms of Optum opportunities on the international front?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Well, that's a good question. I'll start with probably the area that we're spending a lot of time in, and that's the U.K., and what's going on with the U.K. I'm going to ask Jeff Berkowitz, who runs that area, to follow up my comments. But \u2013 and we've talked about this in the past. We've been \u2013 we've been in the U.K. for about 10 years or so, but the past year we have put a lot of time and effort into the development of our products there.","I would say that regardless of the political situation, the challenges, the opportunities, everything that we have been trying to address, nothing has changed. And we feel that the past year, we've been able to establish ourselves in a capacity that people now understand the Optum products. They understand our direction and what we're trying to achieve. So, we remain bullish with some caution around what's going to go on, on the political side. Jeff?","Jeffrey Berkowitz - Executive Vice President, Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","So, Larry, just as you said, we've spent the past years in the U.K. establishing a very strong foundation. We have a strong foundation with the National Health system, a strong foundation with the National Health system improvement, and a very strong foundation of work on the ground with the Department of Health.","And even with Brexit, Optum's foundation stands \u2013 continues to stand strong. And while we don't yet know all the ways Brexit will play out, as Larry just said, in the coming months and years, we do believe that the health service right now will continue to drive its existing plans related to our own efforts there. And we will continue to work closely with England's Department of Health and the NHS to help them achieve those important missions.","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","So, Michael, it's Larry again. I would comment on Brazil that we are working with Amil in bringing our technologies, our services to that part of the world. And that's going pretty well. And there are other development countries that are too early for us to talk about. But as we talked about back at the Investor Day, we believe this is about a $500 billion market, so we're going to stay and be part of it.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for the update.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please?","Operator","Next we'll go to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you. And first, I would be remiss if I didn't say congratulations to John, and David, and Tami on their new roles, well-deserved and lovely to see.","And with that, can we focus on something that's important, but I'm not sure we actually got a whole lot of detail around this? OptumRx has clearly done a very good job of winning competitive business and not based solely on price, or not even importantly on price, but rather on what appears to be an innovative and intriguing combination of services and capabilities as well as scale.","But implementation is going to be important, so \u2013 and I gathered from your commentary around guidance that you plan to spend to implement, which is great. But can you give us some more details about what you plan to do to ensure that these new lives as well as the existing lives, as seamless an experience becoming OptumRx beneficiaries as did the 11 million commercial lives, which you clearly were able to bring on without even a whisper of an issue? That would be very helpful. And with some estimate of what it will impact presumably in third and fourth quarter. Thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So I think that's an excellent area of interest. So...","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","I'll start.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yup.","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","So, Sheryl, it's Larry. I'm going to ask Mark to comment after I finish. So, I know, you know that we have certain priorities that we work toward in Optum, and one of them is to establish, what I'll call, these deeper, more comprehensive relationships. I think we had a goal to have about 8 to 10 of them by the end of 2016. I think, we're pushing 17 right now. And these last wins were part of that.","So, as part of going after that effort a few years ago, we have been strengthening leadership ever since that started. So, we feel very, very confident in the leadership that we have, and that we have developed as well as with the combination of Catamaran and OptumRx, we're pretty solid when it comes to that.","When you step over into implementation and execution, that happens to also be one of our key priorities that we pride ourself on. So, this is not really out of the ordinary, what we do. So, we looked at both of those things from an execution standpoint as well as from a people standpoint, and so the third question you asked is about the monetary side of this, and it's built in. So, there should not be any impact at all to guidance. We expect to get these type of relationships, and we have built it in the plan. So, there shouldn't be anything extraordinary that would happen from a financial standpoint. Mark?","Mark A. Thierer - Chief Executive Officer, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Yes, Sheryl. Good morning, and, Larry, thank you. So, I think, I'd like to just take a moment and talk about what broadly large-scale buyers want and need. And we are feeling very good about the fact that our message is resonating, and we posted some substantial wins here recently, and it's not by accident. Large buyers have a set of complicated needs but, first and foremost, they need a flexible and proven technology partner and engine to drive their PBM benefit. They obviously need market-clearing economics and prices \u2013 price matters. But our model of providing superior service and really focusing on quality and then marrying our data analytics and our synchronization capability, these are really the reasons that our message is resonating.","And then finally, if someone's going to make a bet on a big transition, you have to have a track record of executing on large-scale conversions or transitions. And this combined business has that. As you know, there was a very large-scale transition several years ago in OptumRx. And in our prior business at Catamaran, we had bought and integrated eight companies. And so, the notion of a heavy lift and making large-scale implementations happen is something that we know how to do. So, we're feeling really good about the balance of the year and the work plan in place to implement these flawlessly.","If you look back on our 1\/1\/16, where we also had a good number of new client wins, we got great channel checks on our implementation work, because that's the heart and soul of this business. You have to do well. It all starts with a successful implementation, and we do know what to do. So, thanks for the question.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. We only have a few more minutes, so a couple more questions. So, the next one, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. One of the areas of growth you called out in OptumHealth, one of those drivers was expansion of behavioral services into new Medicaid markets. You called that on the press release. I'm curious. Could you elaborate on that a little bit more on that particular growth opportunity, how sustainable is it, and how much did it contribute to this 15% growth in that segment? Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Mike?","Michael Weissel - Executive Vice President, Optum Consumer Solutions, UnitedHealth Group, Inc","Sure. So, this is Mike Weissel. Thanks for the question. I think, when we look at behavioral health and we look at the Medicaid market, in particular, we see a number of opportunities. I think, we see them both in combination with UnitedHealthcare, as Austin mentioned earlier, in the areas of the long-term social services or IDD population. Those populations continue to kind of be driven into managed care in some way with the behavioral piece. So, we see plenty of opportunity there.","There are also other states, which are looking to do that on a direct basis. And so, we compete on a regular basis and have a robust pipeline today, specifically, in the direct market with some of these states as they look to build it. So, we see that as a continuing growth opportunity for us.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the continued integration of behavioral health in the mainstream clinical?","Austin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","I just would comment. This is Austin Pittman. So, Mike mentioned this, but the work we continue to do to really integrate our behavioral health with our physical health really creating a new model that we're calling whole-person health is really an exciting new direction for us. It certainly will bode well for UnitedHealthcare and Optum's growth on that piece of business, as well as that external business. In fact, you could probably think of it with a lot of the same attributes that were just discussed around OptumRx, integrating and synchronizing network with our full clinical model. Same thing applies here. It's a really exciting next step for us.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And it's not limited to Medicaid.","Austin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","No.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's broad-based. Next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. You spoke to the backlog growth which looks really nice in OptumInsight. Could you speak to where you see major opportunities and kind of the composition maybe of the opportunities that you're seeing there?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, maybe just in broad strokes, though. Larry?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","So I'll start and \u2013 I'll start. And it's Larry, Christine. So I'll get going here, and I'm going to ask Bill Miller to come in on this as well. So, when \u2013 we look at all of our indicators, and all are in line with what we are expecting. In three of the \u2013 what I call the top metrics that we engage with to see how the growth is going.","One would be our qualified sales pipeline, and I brought that up a few minutes ago in the script. And I'll just tell you that from an overall year-over-year standpoint, our qualified sales pipeline, which is a very diverse pipeline, is double the size of what it was this time last year. Obviously, number two is that backlog that we were talking about, where we're up the 15%. That $11.3 billion, obviously, that's another key indicator. And I think the third one is even a stronger one, and that's our \u2013 what I'll call, our closed sales. And how we look at the total contract value on that.","And we're up 80% at the end of the second quarter. And that 80% is going against the entire year of 2015. So, I'm doing an 80% above on contracted \u2013 total contracted revenue for Optum, 80% above what was done an entire year of 2015. So, obviously, the sales pipeline, the closed sales and the backlog, that's going give us a jumpstart into 2017. So, we're feeling very good about where we stand right now. But I might just ask Bill to comment on some of the things that he's actually got going on inside some of these different metrics I'm talking about.","Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Christine. Yeah, as Larry said, there's a lot of confidence if you interrogate that backlog and that prevailing confidence comes from \u2013 if you even look at Q1 and Q2, they were marked by some of the largest software deals we've done. Those are piled into the backlog. We see more of that coming down the pipe in the future. Number two, if you just look at the velocity, the sheer numbers, the size of it, as Larry noted. It is at breakneck pace.","And then third, if you kind of look at the nature and the demographics of that, just our activity in the pipeline, in general, we are the recipients of more RFPs than we've ever been. We are engaging in strategic conversations with more constituencies at a faster pace than we ever had, and that includes health providers, health plans, governments, employers and certainly, pharma.","And then also, I would think the interesting part about it is the comprehensive nature of the \u2013 many of the opportunities in that pipeline. They're very big, they're long in their duration, and they are really aligned with what we've always expressed in terms of these deeper and more comprehensive relationships.","And there is a fair amount of it that's marked by analytics, too. That's a growth market for us. If you look at the demographics in there, and you look at kind of the way we set up in the analytics market, it's clear that we're going to see growth there. The pipeline reflects that. And I think we have distinguished ourselves very well on the analytics front, on the revenue managed front, payment integrity. So, it's a very diverse sort of boundary-less pipeline that I think bodes well for the rest of the year and certainly into 2017.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","But to your point, that's a long lead time and could be uncertain \u2013 unclear in times of time frames, right?","Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Yes.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just challenging to manage that. So, great question. Next question, please? So we'll take two more, and then we'll cut it off. And John and Brent and others will be around for the balance of the day.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to get some more color on your comments on the capital deployment towards OptumCare. You've mentioned that is a focus area and MedExpress. In context of these trends that we continue to see on outpatient mix shifting and ER, and then most recently with the administration making all these changes, not the least of which is macro, I was wondering if you have an increased appetite at this time to buy primary care docs? And are you seeing more willingness for them to affiliate with you relative to the hospital? And then the second part of that was what about ambulatory surgery centers, given that seems to be a big trend in terms of elective surgeries and procedures?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, we'll go another 10 minutes responding to that question.","David Scott Wichmann - President","Ana, it's Dave Wichmann. Maybe just to extend on the capital deployment front, and then if Larry or Jack want to comment as well, please feel free to do so. I think John Rex in his new role as CFO did a great job responding to our overall capital priorities, but I think it has been consistent over time. We have allocated about 50% of our capital to growth and about 50% of our capital to returning to shareholders. And you can see that is strongly biased towards the dividend right now, as we seek to also pay down our debt and get our leverage ratio down to 40%.","The 50% on M&A we really didn't touch on a whole lot, and our priorities remain pretty consistent as they have been. As you can see, we've been investing significantly into Optum. And you can see the returns of that, which have been extensive. I think, the team has done a fantastic job of driving nice returns on the invested capital basis that we put in place there.","Two of those areas were the MedExpress platform, which is the urgent care platform, which supports the notion of us providing better quality, more consumer-responsive and higher-value care, and in this case happens to be in the ambulatory setting. We said that, that was a foundational investment in MedExpress. And I think, as you knew at the time, we would continue to invest into opening new locations in that business over time. And as you can imagine, with de novo startups, they tend to create a little bit of a drag on earnings, particularly, as you're just getting going in the early stages of that.","Your instincts are right, and they kind of tie into the trend conversation that Dan discussed as well, which is we're seeing a higher utilization of ER. And, of course, the care setting and the urgent care, we believe, is much more effective and will help to obviate costs not only for UnitedHealthcare but across all the payers that Optum serves.","Another area of priority for us is to continue to invest in the OptumCare business. Larry laid out quite nicely, I believe, the 75 markets that we want to pursue, which constitute about 80% of all health care. And one of the areas in which we're pursuing that is through the development of physician practices and services in those markets. And we have an initial foundation of that, I believe about $10 billion of revenue or so on a combined basis. We serve over 7 million patients, and we have a nice going business, I believe, in some stages of some 25-plus markets so far. And our activities there continue, and we'll continue to deploy capital in that area and continue to pursue the development of our business in that primary care setting. Larry, do you want to add?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Yeah, just a couple things. Today, we have about 175 MedExpress urgent care centers. And we have been doing about 30 start-ups a year. I think, we'll ramp that up 2017 to about 75. And then we probably have another additional 75 urgent care centers that were all part of the primary care businesses that we have, and we have acquired. So, as Dave said, this is one of our top growth pillars in terms of what we're trying to do for the future, and we're going to be focused on that. The other side of this is OptumCare, and I'll let Jack talk about that.","Jack Larsen - Executive Vice President, OptumCare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Thanks, Larry. Good morning, Ana. In the OptumCare Care Delivery business, we're certainly in the early innings of building this. To your question on receptivity, yes, we are seeing increased receptivity of some of the higher-quality physician groups, primarily organized around primary care to look not only to join us but really to do something different in terms of the way they care for their patients, really looking for the assistance coming out of care delivery, out of Bill Miller's business with OptumInsight, around population health tools and really re-equipping them to up their game to be more attractive to large-plan sponsors and large employers looking to contract with physicians in an altogether different way. So, we have been hard at work at that.","And we continue to see good receptivity, and we're going to be at it for certainly the balance of 2016 and 2017. And I think, in one of your questions, you have preferred to MACRA, clearly game-changing when it comes to the world of physicians and providers. We're certainly evaluating the regulatory release, but we think it is really a stamp of approval of where we're taking physicians and getting them right in the thick of more comprehensive population health management.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we can play at that level and can do it right from the start.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks. Very helpful color.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Last question, please?","Operator","And we'll take that question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in, guys. Steve, you mentioned some commentary around 2017 and an outlook coming a little bit later. So, I appreciate we're not going to get into the specifics here. But as you think about the comments you've made and then $2 billion of Optum revenues that we know about, Medicare Advantage, including the fee and group wins that you're seeing, the elimination of the exchanges which, that alone $0.37, $0.38 this year. That's like 5% of earnings. Are there any offsets, anything we should think about that's unusual in 2017 in terms of a headwind that would preclude you from getting into your long term 13% to 16% growth?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, the only ones you missed on the upside were the Stars, the increasing Stars performance and just the overall momentum of growth coming in. And then I think, the offset I would offer is, I think, you have to remain respectful of two things, and that is that our business has increasingly a large factor of federal and state programs, and those programs have funding dynamics to them. So, I think, those things always have to be taken into consideration and respected.","And lastly, as we've talked through the course of the morning, kind of a never-ending respect for medical cost trends and particularly those we outlined this morning, making sure that we are addressing those effectively. And, I think, those two things are environmental but have to always be called out as elements for consideration.","And as we indicated early, we are getting a lot of new business opportunities and successes, and making sure that we stand those up in a very effective and successful way and are meticulous with respect to that execution. Those are the things that I would say balance off in terms of making sure that we are living up to our responsibilities. So, that's the kind of outlook I would bring to it.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we thank you. Just kind of in closing, UnitedHealth Group delivered, I think, a very strong second quarter. UnitedHealthcare and Optum's products and services continue to grow and resonate with consumers and customers. I think, our enterprise is well-positioned to address the changing healthcare needs of the people and markets we serve, and in doing so, we continue to have the momentum of broad-based growth that we're going to take through 2016 and 2017, and hopefully, the decade ahead.","So, this concludes our call, and we thank you for your interest today. Thank you.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."],"21314":["Unitedhealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 19, 2012  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Stephen J.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning in our Form 8-K dated July 19, 2012, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our second quarter and first half 2012 results and discuss the near-term outlook for our businesses.","In the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned, $1.27 per share, an advance of 9% year-over-year, on revenues of more than $27 billion, which increased by 8% year-over-year. Our consolidated medical care ratio of 81.3% reflect strong performance on medical cost results that were slightly better than expected, primarily due to favorable reserve development. The operating cost ratio of 15% reflects continuing growth in services at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and the investments we are making to advance our Optum businesses, particularly pharmacy services. Efficiencies from our multiyear operational improvement efforts partially offset this cost growth. Adjusted cash flows of $2 billion brought first half 2012 adjusted cash flows to $3 billion, up $650 million year-over-year. Our financial flexibility continues to be distinctive. In the first half of this year, we grew our dividend payment rate by 31%, extended our share repurchase activities, closed 3 acquisitions in Medicare and still maintained a debt-to-total capital ratio of 30% and $1 billion in available cash. Annualized return on equities for the first half of 2012 was 19%.","Let's review our business results, starting with UnitedHealthcare, which continues to sharpen its innovative focus toward greater simplicity, quality, affordability and consumer value. UnitedHealthcare provided medical benefits to nearly 36 million people at June 30, an expansion of 1.7 million year-over-year and an increase of 305,000 in the quarter. Second quarter revenues increased 8% to $25.5 billion, and the outlook for new business remains strong.","Looking forward, recent successes include affirmation by the government of our mid-2013 TRICARE award for military benefits to serve nearly 3 million military personnel and family members, the Kansas and Ohio awards for Medicaid benefits and the selection of UnitedHealthcare by Texas and Nebraska to provide health benefits to their employee. These awards, unless publicized engagements we're winning day in and day out, reflect our commitment to serve, to execute and to innovate.","Breaking down second quarter results, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual year-to-date growth stands at 550,000 consumers served, which reflects a decrease of 25,000 people in the second quarter, as we expected. Favorable cost trends and overall client satisfaction remain key positives. Our service reputation remains strong, customer retention is high and response in our newer, more innovative products and technologies continues to grow.","The values \u2013 the value of our network \u2013 our networks deliver in care quality and cost containment is high, but we are seeing an ongoing shift in market priorities. Large sophisticated buyers are placing their business based upon well-aligned consumer and care provider engagement, aligned to effective clinical management capabilities. Collectively, these elements have positioned us to continue to add value and grow our self-funded business into 2013.","For the risk-based market segment, the competitive climate continues to be aggressive but rational. This remains consistent with what we have been seeing for more than 1 year. Some pricing we see in select regional markets seems to reflect the assumption of ongoing lower medical trends, while some pricing strategies seem to be simply based on the avoidance of any rebates under minimum MLR provisions. We expect this market to continue to be highly competitive into 2013. We will hold fast to our disciplines and accordingly expect continued pressure on our risk-based product membership. We believe customers and our company are better served by consistent and predictable pricing supported by our realistic view of forward cost trends.","In Medicaid, UnitedHealthcare Community & State continues to grow steadily, adding 210,000 people served this quarter and a total of 275,000 people year-to-date. New implementations and new awards in 2012 include Louisiana, Texas, Washington State and Kansas. In Ohio, we received awards for both the traditional Medicaid population and for duly eligible residents. We now serve Medicaid programs in about half the states in the U.S. This includes services such as behavioral health care and pharmacy benefits, which they customers increasingly seek to integrate into their Medicaid offerings. Service to the duly eligible and integrated benefit offerings both play to UnitedHealthcare's historical experience and strength.","As with our commercial benefits, UnitedHealthcare Community & State remains disciplined in ensuring we achieve an appropriate return on the capital we have invested. We continue to take a prudent market sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing relationships. We remain committed to partner with states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. But we will withdraw from programs within states or change the nature of our service to those programs as needed in instances where we see that commitment to viability weaken.","UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement completed 2 acquisitions in Florida and also have the strongest organic growth this quarter among all participants in the Medicare Advantage market, based on CMS data. Our growth demonstrates the value for consumers of our Medicare Advantage plans, which includes our focus on benefits popular with seniors and their positive experience receiving well-coordinated care from a strong network of local physicians. In total, we increased our Medicare Advantage participation by 85,000 seniors this quarter and are serving 340,000 more seniors through the first half of 2012.","Our filed 2013 benefits again offer market competitive plans and focus on the benefits that seniors tell us they value most. We anticipate continued steady growth next year as well because of the ongoing entrance into Medicare of millions of seniors, our expanding market presence and the consistently high consumer value our programs offer. Overall, we expect to UnitedHealthcare will serve between 1.8 million and 2 million more consumers this year, making 2012 among the strongest and most diversified membership growth years UnitedHealthcare has ever experienced.","Turning to margins and medical costs UnitedHealthcare's second quarter operating margin of 7.5% remained in line year-over-year. We expect our consolidated medical care ratio in 2012 to be in the range of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. This is an improvement to our outlook from last November and is based on results from the past 6 months, including reserve development realized to date. We forecast our commercial Medicare care ratio for 2012 to come in toward the lower end of the range we most recently provided, which was 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. And we continue to forecast commercial, medical cost trends this year at about 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","Unit cost increases remain a primary driver. Utilization continues to increase modestly. Outpatient usage continues to rise, with increases across all markets, commercial, Medicare and Medicaid, all consistent with our last quarter. This is more reflective of an increased number of patient visits and procedures than the more intensive services on a per visit basis. Some of this increase volume results from our efforts to encourage more appropriate use of health system resources, with patients receiving service on an outpatient basis rather than via full inpatient admissions. Use of physician services is generally stable, and inpatient activity remains restraint.","UnitedHealthcare's pharmacy costs are again showing the benefits of our intensive management. We will improve upon these approaches still further as we engage OptumRx to administer our commercial offerings and pharmacy programs.","While we're executing well, we remain cautious because pressures on the benefits market remain significant and continue to build. The commercial sector is competitive. Job creation and new business formation are weak, which impacts growth. Great pressures in government programs are intensifying, and rates in some Medicaid venues are even slightly negative. Unlike prior years, these current Medicaid rate reductions are generally not been mitigated by corresponding benefit reductions or provider fee schedule reductions. We have discussed the funding challenges faced by state programs a number of times and are now more clearly seeing the predictive effects of those pressures in the marketplace.","In the senior market, Medicare Advantage rate increases have been minimum -- minimal for 3 years or more. Changes to quality Star definitions that were made after the measurement period was completed will adversely impact rates for many Medicare Advantage market participants for 2013. This backdrop suggests year-over-year gross margin pressure in the back half of 2012 and into 2013 in health care benefits. In this environment, UnitedHealthcare will focus on using new product offerings aligned to more modern consumer engagement techniques and effectively engage our focused clinical programs and high-performance networks to achieve growth with fair margins and capital return. We are also intensely focused on reducing operating costs, becoming leaner, more streamlined and ever closer to the customer.","Turning to health services. Optum produced revenues of $7.3 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 4% over last year. The OptumHealth and OptumInsight businesses posted 21% and 16% top line gains, respectively, with the latter adjusted for divested businesses in 2011. Growth drivers included expansion in integrated care delivery and continued growth in compliance services and clinical and operational performance tools.","Our technology and related services offerings continued to show strong market acceptance, with the Optum revenue backlogs again growing more than 20% over last year. This growth was led by strengthened data and information infrastructure solutions for government customers, compliant services for hospitals and performance tools for payers. Future revenues will also benefit from the integration of services in the new Medicaid award in Kansas.","In the pharmacy services, we are implementing some recent large customer awards, which will modestly benefit second half 2012 revenues, and we continued steadily growth of specialty drug and mail services. But these impacts are more than offset by the decline in Part D volumes that began in January of this year.","Optum's mission is to make the health care system work better for everyone. We leverage enterprise-level capabilities to drive more positive outcomes, reduce costs and simplify and improve the health care experience for all participants across the system. We size our addressable market at 500 billion and steadily growing. As a business, we're continuing to create what we call One Optum, evolving Optum into a more integrated enterprise, intensely focused on customer needs across the 8 distinct markets we serve. The businesses are lining to deliver the more comprehensive and sophisticated and sustaining solutions customers require in an increasingly complex and changing health care environment, solutions that bring greater and more consistent quality, speed, efficiency and lower cost.","Our One Optum efforts are creating a progressively flatter, more integrated organization that is simpler and leaner, more understandable and more responsive to customers. Our Optum cost structure is also becoming leaner, and we're better leveraging the scale of the enterprise. We are strengthening and more tightly aligning shared services and operational support and administration, and removing redundancies that are the historical result of organizing smaller businesses around specific products. When combined with this flatter, simpler organizational approach, tighter alignment enables in an evolution from a product-oriented enterprise to one focused on more integrated customer solutions. This opens up opportunities to serve larger, more comprehensive and longer-term relationships established with customers at more senior executive levels.","Optum's second quarter operating earnings of $320 million were in line with our expectation and improved $68 million sequentially. We accelerated certain investments this quarter to move faster on integration and better position Optum for future growth. With our first half performance, Optum is on track to deliver full year operating earnings consistent with our projections. Second half earnings will benefit from the improved leverage from our One Optum efforts and seasonably favorable revenue trends in a number of our businesses that are driven by year-end business dynamics. We continue to see operating earnings of between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which is modestly above 2011. This despite absorbing incremental development expenses of more than $150 million in 2012. We expect to further build on that performance into 2013 and remain on path to doubling Optum's 2011 earnings by 2015, driven through organic growth, operational efficiencies and PBM in-sourcing.","To sum up, in a challenging environment, UnitedHealth Group's strong second quarter and first half performance were characterized by broad-based growth, strong service and execution for clients, continued innovation in products and services, solid margins and positive earnings and cash flows. We want to thank our 100,000 employees for their compassion and their commitment to the people we serve. Every day, they're working intensively to deliver dependable consistent service, innovating and building the capabilities of the future. And their capacities to adapt quickly to changing markets remains critical to our future.","As always, we have concerns about today's challenging environment in the health benefits market. These are not new. There continues to be more downward than upward pressure across the health care landscape. We expect this environment to prevail for some time due to the employment malaise and imminent regulatory changes. State budgets are clearly constrained for Medicaid. Medicare funding is similarly pressured. Deficits leave policymakers with little room to address long-standing funding issues.","Long before expansion markets, such as exchanges, due eligibles and broader state Medicaid expansions, are fully established and productive, industry regulations and taxes will be imposed and realized. Our diversified position is a strength as we work to address these headwinds, but we have respect for the challenges ahead and believe market expectations should remain in check and aligned to these realities.","Based on our results so far, we have increased our 2012 outlook for revenues to $110 billion and earnings to a range of $4.90 to $5 per share. First half earnings benefited from reserve development, as well as the first quarter rebate adjustments, while second half results will include TRICARE startup costs.","While we always endeavor to perform to our full potential, we expect earnings per share in the second half to be slightly lower than the first. Longer term, we expect significant market expansion and see opportunities for market share growth. Consumers and benefit sponsors want more for less. At the most basic level, they want higher quality care at a more affordable cost. Consumers have demanded and received more for less in virtually every other segment of our economy, and health care will not be immune. The government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector solutions. The private sector provides a more flexible and open, better managed, higher-quality health care experience than traditional passive indemnity programs built solely on leveraging fee-for-service.","The commercial market has been consolidating for some time, and that trend will continue. To capitalize on the opportunities of the future on a national or even multi-market basis, it will be essential to invest in and create leading innovative capabilities and competitive operating cost structures. These have been underlying themes in our businesses for some time.","On the Optum side, the market for health services is just beginning to ripen. Optum is an early-stage enterprise relative to the scale of what we believe will ultimately develop in this sector.","We look forward to providing you with a full view of our 2013 aspirations and expectations at our annual investor conference, which will be held in New York City on Tuesday, November 27.","I will now turn this call back to our moderator for questions. And again, thank you for joining us today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was looking, Steve, to get a perspective from you on the consolidation that's ongoing in the government segments and particularly the large transaction that WellPoint and Amerigroup conducted recently. And can you tell us what your thoughts are on strategic alliances versus consolidating more regional players sort of in a more of a national sort of broader-based M&A play?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure, Ana. Obviously, we won't comment on specific transactions. But I think I kind of hit it in the end of my formal comments. And that is the demands in the marketplace broadly, whether they\u2019re in the commercial side or the government side, are just continuing to increase, become more sophisticated, more complex. And the responses to them, we think, deserve a very focused response and need to be scaled. So we've kind of taken those philosophies in our own business for many years, and have focus our responses to those kinds of markets with dedicated business units and has sought to expand them and grow them and build their capabilities. So it is not surprising to see that kind of activity we have said that will be coming, and it really has been happening for probably 15 years or more. So we, as I said in my final comments, we expect that to continue. Now in some respects, we've accomplished those things, both through relationships in the marketplaces and alliances. And in some instances, we have chosen to invest. I think you're going to see both those kinds of responses in the marketplace. And I think both of them can work depending upon the specific market that you're dealing in.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then a follow-up on that. So the excess cash flow that you have, if you could provide some perspective on the priorities on health benefits relative to health services and on the benefits side, commercial versus government, then on buybacks and potentially, future increases in dividends?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes. So again, our financial position remains strong. Our cash generation capacities remain strong. That's really no change from the past. So our approach with respect to capital allocation hasn't changed. Since it relates to expansion activities, we are interested in continuing to build on -- across our business broadly. We look at it, not just in market segments also, but in the cultivation of capabilities. So basically, all the above is my, I'm sure, unsatisfactory answer to you because we're really interested in building and see opportunities to build in virtually every one of our business areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, a question on Medicare Advantage. Steve, I think you mentioned steady growth expectations as we've seen in prior years, but that continuing to 2013. But you followed that up with a comment about, we've seen rate increases kind of at a minimum for the last few years and that perhaps is going to lead to some margin pressure second half this year, maybe in the first half of next year. Just maybe pull those 2 comments together. Does that suggest perhaps a more aggressive strategy to grow market share? Maybe spending a bit of margin here now to perhaps accelerate Medicare Advantage growth over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'll kind of comment broadly, and then let Gail and maybe Tom respond. But I would say one is, that environment really isn't any different than the one we've been having for the last 3 years, probably at least. And we really align to philosophies around steadiness of managing our benefits and being consistent in the marketplace, and we have historically tried to lean towards the benefits that seniors in specific marketplaces seem to respond to most effectively. I don't think things like that broadly are changing. We're really just outlining an environment that has prevailed and looks like it is not going to change any time soon. You want to add?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Yes. It's Gail Boudreaux. A few comments just build on Steve's. We have, as you know, been dealing with the rate environment in Medicare for a number of years, and our focus is on the sustainability of the benefits and the program for consumers. We work hard around affordability, how we work with physicians and hospitals to ensure that we've got the right programs underneath that, as well as improving our overall quality. So from that perspective, we've had that strategy for the last few years and we're going to continue to stay focused on that. We think that's really important to the Medicare program overall and think it can provide good value. The second issue, on growth. We're pleased with our growth. We've had, as you heard in Steve's opening comment, very strong growth in the SEP part of enrollment, as well as a strong opening to the year in AEP, so pleased with the value that we're bringing to the marketplace and in the markets that we're growing. And as you saw this quarter, we also added several acquisitions, which we think helps strengthen our position in markets, as well as capabilities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the Medicaid comments that you made. Do you think we're close to the point where we'll start to see, again, some Medicaid Managed Care participants begin to pull out of the market in order to rebalance the relationship between state governments and the private sector?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'll start this and let Gail and Jack mop this up. But this -- that response obviously varies market by market. And the posture that states take vary market by market. But the answer to that is yes, that if we see situations that we believe the state isn't prepared to sustain in a particular market, we will withdraw, or as I said in my formal comments, withdraw or reposition the programs. And I think that, that discipline has to prevail just like it prevails in other parts of our business. Jack?","Jack Larsen","Thanks, Steve. Mike, just maybe echo a part of Steve's comments. A successful program between the private sector and any particular state really rests on 2 things. It really rests on a partnership going both ways, and I use partnership in the fullest sense of the word, and then really mutually satisfactory economics. And if one or both of those are missing, then I think we're not doing a service to a state and they're certainly not being well served by us if we continue to sort of slug along in a relationship that isn't really working ultimately for the Medicaid beneficiary.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","First of all, I just wanted to clarify something. Nothing in your comments should suggest, with respect to Medicaid or any of your other businesses, that you're willing to break price discipline, even if your margin might be a bit lower year-over-year. Is that correct?","Stephen J. Hemsley","We are not breaking pricing disciplines across any of our business platforms at all on the health benefits side or on the Optum side.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to hear you say that because there was an element to that question which almost made it sound like that was the question.","Stephen J. Hemsley","No, actually, I think we answered that one that we will take the steps necessary if the economics aren't sustainable.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Yes, you did. And my real question is this. I'm fascinated by the notion of One Optum. It appeals on so many different levels, from the good business sense to the market opportunity. And I'm curious about what trends or factors you might have seen in the market that tell you that now is the appropriate time to respond in that way and\/or to lead the customer, whether there's been perhaps growth in the sophistication that at a pace that maybe is a little bit more accelerated that it might have been a year ago, whether there are fundamental changes going on in the market that -- and I'm just -- I guess, I'm sorry for a lack of specificity around the question because it's -- what I'm trying to get at here is there's an issue of United leading too quickly where the market can't go. And so this is a major change. It's a different approach. I think it's the right approach. And I'm curious as to why you think that now is the right time to do this and what types of things you might be able to accomplish by having a more integrated product in transforming some of these relationships and ultimately the way we pay for and deliver care.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sheryl, I think it's an excellent observation and question. I think I'll have Larry respond. But I would offer a few themes in the onset. As we formulated Optum, brought it under a single brand, aligned the businesses, kind of base bind [ph] them last year, this was basically that market need we saw at that time. So we are really just continuing to execute along those same themes. And the One Optum is a good title in essence, that is code across our enterprise for the acceleration of that -- of those integration themes across our business. And these have been well laid out. And Larry can really run with those.","Larry C. Renfro","Sure. It's Larry. I think with Steve's comment, as well as Steve's earlier comments when he opened up, I think you kind of know where we're headed in terms of One Optum. So let me back up for one second. We decided based on goals that we set that we were trying to go to the 15% ROIC and 6% margin by 2015, which is basically doubling our 2011 earnings, that we needed to put together a very strong and focused business plan, 3-year plan. And in putting together that 3-year plan, we are seeing the amount of attention, traction, however you want to look at it, that we're receiving from our 8 markets that we're focused on. And as a result of that, we're looking at how we're going to hit those numbers from a performance standpoint. And as we've been getting into this with our potential customers and so forth, we believe that about 50% of that will come from growth and 50% will come from what I'll call cost management, integration, alignment and the PBM in-sourcing. So if you kind of take a look at where we're at today, in 2012, we're feeling pretty good that we're in line with expectations. And when we get to, what I think one of the questions you were asking is about the markets and growth and so forth, we're seeing that we're in large markets that are getting larger, and then we believe that we're starting to really be able to learn a lot. And we're going to be expanding as we go forward.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think the market is postured for longer-term relationships that they're pursuing a broader set of aligned services and seeing the need for that. They are building capabilities and we are building ourselves into them as part of that, and they are clearly buying -- their buying behaviors are moving towards longer-term, more sustainable integrated. And the point I was making before is that probably existed 1 year, 1.5 year. So we are urgent about getting Optum, this One Optum agenda moving forward because we think the market is already there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on some of your comments about pricing into next year. I mean, you broadly indicated that the environment was I think aggressive but rational. But the comments around pricing that appears to -- your competitors appear to be assuming that continuation of low utilization maybe runs counter to how we think about what's rational, and certainly, my impression of what we were seeing in the last few years. And then, obviously, your comments about expecting to lose membership implies that you don't see your competitors as entirely rational. Maybe you can just flesh out some of what you're seeing there. And then also provide some color on markets, in particular, where you feel like things are maybe more competitive?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. So really this is around the definition of rational, right?","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So Gail, do you want to take a shot?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Consistent with the comments we've made over the last several quarters, we expected the market to get more competitive, and that's what we're seeing. So, let's say we're not seeing any change in that. We talk about rational. Our competitors are making decisions based on their rebate positions, their view of minimum medical loss ratios, their view of future trend. And yes, as we said, I think in the last couple of calls, there are certain pockets where they're making those decisions, but overall we do see it as rational. When we talked to -- gave you our guidance last year and what we said in the last several quarters is that, consistent with that competitive environment, we are seeing some pressure on our enrollment. You saw that this quarter and you've seen it this year. So I think that's how it ties to it. We've been very consistent and disciplined in our pricing, and that's creating some of that pressure, but we're going to stay the course on that. And we're looking at pricing to our future view of trending costs.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then maybe just to kind of follow up on that into a different product. You mentioned that you expected some rate pressure on the Medicaid side. Obviously, you've seen a lot of RFPs. And how much of what you're seeing -- I think certainly some of your competitors have seen some disruption in states. How much of that disruption is a function of what the states are asking for because of their budget pressures or because of the competitive environment, as far as the bidding process goes among your peers, has gotten more competitive and kind of forced people to go to a spectrum they shouldn't be?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'll let Jack answer that. But I think the budget issues are the prevailing.","Jack Larsen","Yes, I would agree. Jack Larsen. So you opened your comments referring to some of the disruptions that some of our competitors had \u2013- really, it\u2019s tough for us to comment on those particular disruptions. We don't actually participate in those programs that have gotten some of the more recent focus. I would say, overall, price rates are being pressured probably more so by state budget positions this year and then going into next year. We certainly expect a fair amount of competitive give and take on new states. I think we priced very thoughtfully on our new wins in Kansas, most recently in Ohio. But I would say, overall, it is just the continuing pressure on states trying to make more go farther than they have before.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think you can really see it aligned to the budget status of the state.","Jack Larsen","Yes.","Stephen J. Hemsley","That's where you're going to have your problem.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. First on the commercial pricing environment and your kind of outlook for that segment. I was hoping maybe you could just give us some perspective on this market from a pricing -- on the pricing side, just in terms of the pricing environment today is rationally aggressive. It's a term we've heard a lot over the years. Can you maybe compare it to what we think of as the last pricing cycle that we saw, let's call it 2006 through 2008? Maybe you can just give us some perspective there on how that looked. And then, on the commercial cost trends, can you talk us through your cost trends by the 4 segments? And given you've lowered your commercial or at least took your commercial MLR targets at the lower end of the guidance, does that mean that cost trends also coming in towards the lower end there, especially given pricing doesn't seem to be all that great?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think with the opening qualifier that the market circumstances and situation of a time is unique to its time. So you really can't say, \"Oh, this is 2000x or 19-something or other.\" So I think putting that aside, I think we can offer some comments on that. Gail?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Justin, your question is comparing it to prior cycles. I would look at that the environment is fundamentally different. We're in a different regulatory environment with minimal medical loss ratios. We didn't have that the last few years. And quite frankly, the utilization we\u2019re coming out of. So I don't see it necessarily as comparable to those cycles. Plus, as Steve said in his opening comments, we remained, I think, very respectful of the pressures, underlying pressures around unit costs and increasing utilization over time. And then the impact of reform provisions as we go through 2013 and 2014. So from that perspective, we see people making decisions based on their view of minimum MLR rate regulation, et cetera. So that's why, we're characterizing this and see it as a rational market. A competitive one but rational. And I guess, I'll ask Dan to comment on your questions around utilization.","Stephen J. Hemsley","On a market-by-market, if we would really analyze each market, the activities are not -- are understandable, right?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Right. Each market has different pressures facing it based on the dynamics of the competitors that are in that market and the products that they have. And we've also managed our business very much on a market-to-market basis, looking at both national trends, but also putting products in those markets that make sense where we can be competitive.","Dan Schumacher","Jeff. I'm Dan Schumacher. To follow up on your question on cost trends across all 3 of our businesses. We've been talking obviously through the balance of 2011 and into 2012 that we were seeing increases in our medical trend largely due to increases in utilization, and that's coming true and playing out. We're seeing it across the platform. You had also asked about, I think, the relationship of the loss ratio to trend. With respect to our loss ratio, on the commercial side, we do expect it to be at the low end of the range, that 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. And our reported loss ratio has a host of factors influencing it. When you look at the trend on more of a core basis, our trend is coming in exactly where we expected it and that's at that 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. And I would not update that to say anything other than in the mid-point of that range.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And just my other follow-up was on the government segments. And you're talking about -- I think you've taken a more conservative tone on the margins going forward. And I was just hoping you could give us some color in terms of how those businesses are performing in the second quarter in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Maybe talking either year-over-year or sequentially just been in terms of, are you seeing any pressure on those business yet? Or are they coming in better or worse than expected? Just a at the moment comment would be great.","Dan Schumacher","You bet. This is Dan again. On the second quarter, as you look at it, as compared to the performance in the same quarter last year, our government programs in aggregate are performing better. So we have -- they're contributing more earnings and they have a lower loss ratio in aggregate. And then as you start to break it into the pieces, our Medicare is actually performing a little better. Our Medicaid is performing a little bit worse. And the largest contributor to is the little bit more favorable development in the Medicare space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was hoping you could elaborate on the comment that you made about the change to the Medicare Star ratings after the bids were submitted and the pressure that would put on rates and margins in Medicare Advantage in '13?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. Actually I think Tom can respond to that most effectively.","Tom Paul","Sure. As you know, the Medicare program now has a Star rating program that includes a pay per performance. And a lot of the performance that we're doing is more futuristic. So we are working today for results in that bonus program that will actually be achieved in '15. And so when you have that kind of gap in timeframe of performance to actual payment, there can be changes in definitions in the meantime that may change that focus of your performance. And so going into 2013, there was a change in definitions around some of the thresholds or some of the performance measures around the Star ratings, which, in many situations cause plans across the industry to have a lower performance, lower Star rating than would have been achieved under the previous definition.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So you're essentially saying that the CMS made the requirements harder or higher to achieve and that's resulting in lower Star ratings?","Tom Paul","Yes, it could have been a change in the level of requirement. It could have been a change in priority for CMS.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Meaning, a new metric that hadn't been looked up previously?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Change in metrics or a change in weighting, right?","William C. Ballard","Yes. It likely would be a change in the weighting or an increase in prioritization of a particular metric over another.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I believe UNH expected to incur something like $245 million in total investments related to...","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'm sorry, could you get closer because we can't hear you?","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, I'm sorry about that. I believe United expected to incur $245 million in investments for the OptumRx repatriation, Optum broadly and TRICARE, and then something like another $215 million in compliance costs. Given this year, given the commentary around some of that being accelerated into the first half, can you provide any additional color, maybe just how much of that we've seen in the first half versus how much is left to go in the second half? And then also beyond that, how much of that we can really count on rolling off in the '13, potentially providing the tailwind to offset some of the gross margin pressures we've been talking about across the benefits business?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes. I would not suggest -- I think if that had been as meaningful as your question might suggest, we would have responded to it specifically in the formal comments. I think there has been some pull-through into the first. But I can also tell you that we will continue to try to accelerate because we're trying to go as fast as we can, particularly across Optum. Dave, you want to comment?","David S. Wichmann","I think, Melissa, you may be talking specifically a little bit about the cost to compliance that we outlined at the investor conference, and then also some of the commentary we made in the first quarter and how that's shaking out. So let me see if I can address this succinctly and then maybe give you a little bit more color. So with respect to the ACA, the law implementation, actually we see those costs accelerating towards the last half of the year, primarily as we prepare for the exchanges and the payment of rebates and things of that nature. So you can expect an acceleration there. Same goes -- it holds true for the PBM. As you might suspect, as we get to the kind of the last innings, if you will, in the preparation for that, we're hiring people, we're moving members onto our systems and incurring a lot of the operating costs in those final steps. So you'll see that more towards the back half of the year. 50 10, [ph] we're done. We finished that in Q1. We finished clean. It was a huge success for us. And I think we set the bar for the industry there. ICD-10 is pretty steady. So net-net, as you think about these costs of compliance, we\u2019re -- actually we\u2019ll see more of those in the second half of the year than we see in the first. Plus in the first quarter, I think we outlined a couple of things, and these are all really good news. They may sound like bad news in terms of initial costs incurred, but they're all related to the superior growth that UnitedHealthcare has been able to put in place. So for TRICARE, you're going to see a significant amount of operating cost in the back half of the year associated with getting ready for that program. Those will carry over into the beginning part of '13 until we start earning a revenue on that case. Medicaid for Ohio and Kansas, obviously, those wins are great, but we have to prep and install them, same thing with commercial on Nebraska and Texas. So all of those things really are costs to implement. It's all good news. It may show up as a little bit of a deviation on the operating cost side, but that's good. And then the last thing I'd just remind you, on the last half of the year, we're seasonally high in our operating costs, primarily as we get prepared for January and the more intensive medical utilization seasons, as well as we get ready for AEPs with staffing and whatnot. So expect overall in the operating cost side, you'll see that operating cost ratio elevate over the back half of the year.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just to clarify. As we head into '13, we talked a little bit about some of that investment coming out and some ongoing. Is there any way that we can size maybe how to think about SG&A in those investments as a headwind or tailwind into '13?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think what you're referring to is principally around OptumRx, and that is the bulk of those will be incurred in 2012. There will be some that will go into 2013, but on the comparative basis, OptumRx should step up next year. Dirk?","Dirk McMahon","Yes. I mean, what I would say is that as you pace into our migration schedule to begin on the first of 2013 and it paces throughout '13, we will have sort of operating and training costs ramped up consistent with that migration schedule. So let's say there'll be a little bit of operating cost. But if you look, the majority of the development costs have occurred in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask one around kind of principally XLHealth and the integration progress you're making there on 2 fronts. So first of all, I understand that you're using some of their approaches in the more, say, chronic or co-morbid portion of your MA book. And I wondered when the benefits to scoring might manifest from that activity? And then secondly, in the context of XL Plus, INSPIRIS and Evercare, what progress have you made in kind of pulling those together into an integrated solution as it relates to presentations or pitches in dual eligible opportunities?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think it's a great question. I would include our Medicaid capabilities in that as well. But Tom, do you want to start?","Tom Paul","Sure. This is Tom. And with the integration of XLHealth, we're looking at it from 2 approaches. The one that you didn't mention was really around the health plan side of the XLHealth, so the Care Improvement Plus plans and how we're looking to leverage their focus and their capability and their market presence in 2013, which we definitely took advantage of in our bid offerings for 2013. On the side you did mention, we are expanding the capabilities around house calls and their integrated clinical care model through a broader Medicare Advantage population with the legacy Medicare & Retirement population. We are showing good progress in that. The results of that, the work we do in '12 will be realized on a -- realized in '13, as well as the clinical advantage that we get today in identifying early gaps in care from a medical management perspective. We realize those now in 2012.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, super. And then on the -- from a duals perspective?","Tom Paul","Yes, those same capabilities. Again, I think we originally saw the XL capability as it's more geared toward the chronically ill. But I think we are now looking at that differently and we're rolling it out more broadly in the Medicare space, whether you're a dual eligible, whether you're in a more traditional Medicare Advantage program, where you can also benefit from that same house call visit. And so we are incorporating that into our dual eligible offerings as well.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Wherever the needs really are challenging and the care paths can be most effectively applied.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So if I could follow up quickly on that, is it possible to call out which states or perhaps, even just quantify the number of states where you think the approach by the state will provide you with the opportunity to really show off your skill sets as opposed to, say, the California situation that's just going to existing vendors?","Tom Paul","Sure, although I would say that when you really look at the compelling notion of how these capabilities ultimately align and integrate and the needs of the populations to be managed, I think all the states will eventually come around. So I really think it's a matter of pacing and whatever factors get -- complicate the pace, in fact, or whether they're political or otherwise, I really think that at end of the day, the states, confronted with the challenges they have, are going to have to embrace these kinds of capabilities. They're better for their populations and they're much better for their programs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Can I just ask on the Medicaid rate pressures? How does that intersect, in your view, with the federal statute for actuarially justified rates? Is that a backstop that you can turn to, to some extent? And if you can give us any geographic detail on the rate pressures, we'd appreciate it.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Right. So I don't think we're going to offer geographic details because I think we, long-term, believe that the states will eventually find -- it will be interested in sustaining these programs. The actuarial issue, Jack, do you want to respond?","Jack Larsen","Sure. So as you pointed out, the actuarial soundness principle is always the backstop each year as states develop and release rates. I guess I would just make a couple of observations around actuarial soundness. One, they do provide ranges. And I think we have seen in our community and state business over year \u2013 over the years sort of a movement inside those ranges, if you will, from high to low. And I would tell you that we are trending towards the lower side of the ranges most times. And the second thing is around rate pressures. There's a number of, I would say, there's a range as to what you assume from Managed Care savings long term. And there is a significant amount of judgment applied to that and most notably in new state entrants where states are doing their very best to anticipate what Managed Care savings might be. So those 2 things are certainly big variables in actuarial soundness, but we're seeing sort of points all in between.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. That makes a lot of sense. And if I could just ask just one follow-up, a clarification really. As you talked about the cost trend at 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points, I got a little confused on where you said you're coming in at that on a reported basis, but at the lower end on some other basis. Dan, maybe you could just clarify what you had meant about that?","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Sorry, Matt. Let me try it again. So on the loss ratio on the commercial side, we expect it to be on the lower end of our guidance. So 82% plus are minus 50 on the lower end. With respect to our trend outlook, full year commercial trend outlook, we're not making any revisions to that. We expect it to be at 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wouldn't you expect both of those together? Sorry, maybe I'm splitting hairs too much.","Stephen J. Hemsley","There are other issues that affect those.","Dan Schumacher","Yes. So I was trying to get at is there are differences between those things that show up in our reported loss ratio in terms of how we look at quarter trend. So I'm saying they're not moving exactly the same. Loss ratios\u2019s lower than the guidance, our trend, we expect to be at 6% plus or minus 50.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes. Just for one, for instance, the rebate adjustment in the first quarter would have affected the loss ratio, but not the core medical trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","If I missed this, just let me know because I had some phone challenges. Payables versus premiums. I know that they can fluctuate a little bit. Were there any timing issues in the quarter on the payables that you'd like to highlight? Because it looks like adjusting for PDP, in prior period development, payables didn't quite keep up with premiums. And then Steve, at your Investor Day, you made some interesting observations about 2014 and how reinsurance and risk adjustment could help to keep small players from dumping. Can you update us on your 2014 broad thoughts, recognizing that we're not in the position to make any specific projections?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'll do the best I can on that. Dave, maybe you want to comment on the payable?","David S. Wichmann","Christine, I'm not really seeing anything on the payables versus premiums front that's unusual in the quarter, other than the fact that we acquired Medicare and Preferred Care and had to put those in our financial statements.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And then could you remind me about what specifically you wanted to probe about 2014? Because I [indiscernible].","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, you made some comments about small players probably not being incentivized at some point in the exchange given risk adjustment and reinsurance. And also, tax advantages. And you had some broad thoughts about how you thought that the structure of the exchanges would protect small groups from dumping and help to protect some profitability there. So I'm just wondering, now that we have a little bit more data, not much, but a little bit more and spend some time studying it?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Actually, we probably don't have any more information. And quite honestly, I would say that the implementation landscape has probably become more complicated because it's clear that there will be some pacing in terms of how this will be implemented as states have seem to have more flexibility and the administration seems to be more flexible in terms of how these will go in. But if there is going to be any sector that is going to pursue the exchanges, it's going to be on this very much smaller. And when you then take a look at that, I think that the pacing of that, if you're a prudent businessperson, you're not going to necessarily go right to that if you have benefits. It might be those who have not had benefits in the past that will pursue the exchange. And then if you are an established business, you might be more prudent in terms of watching how that plays itself out. You do get tax deductibility on benefits. Your employees are paying 20%, 25% of the total cost of these benefits so that the company is subsidizing 75%. When you begin to go to the exchanges, there clearly will have to be a re-leveling on wages. I think employers will look at that and believe that they perhaps have a more control over their benefits than they might have if they lose those benefits and have to make compensation adjustments for health care that they no longer control. I think those -- when you really get into the heads of the business operators, that they\u2019ll be measured in terms of how their response is for those that have benefits and have been committed to benefits in the past. That's why, I think, that things, perhaps, will move into more measured pace. And I think the implementation now is clearly challenging given the time frames that we have left. So if there's an update, that's all I'd offer. Gail?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","I think Steve hit the key points. The first one, we still don't -- there's a lot of unknown still around the exchanges. And two, as you think about the ranges that many experts have given on dumping from 30% to low single-digits, we do think it's going to be at the lower end of that range for the reason Steve talked about, the tax advantage that the employers have, the impacts of what employees pay right now and the penalties. So that will mute, we think, many of the people moving to the exchanges quickly in the beginning.","Stephen J. Hemsley","It may firm up over time, but it will take time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So 2 quick ones. One, just looking at medical services CPI, there was a pretty big uptick in June. And it was driven a lot by the hospital inpatient component. It seems kind of strange that you\u2019d get kind of one month move like that. So I'm just curious, are you seeing anything on the hospital pricing side that's different?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Hospital pricing side?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","In terms of our negotiations with hospitals, I think we've shared this with you before. I mean, we're coming in, in line with the expectations we set. There's clearly pressure. There's been pressure on the unit cost side. We're moving much more of our payment to pay per performance along the broad continuum. So always pressure in the system, but I wouldn't say anything has dramatically changed, and we're doing well against the expectations we set, as well as trying to move much more of our pay to pay per performance.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Then just on the 2013 national account front. I didn't hear much. I'm just curious if you guys have a -- I know it's still a little early, but you guys are probably moving through the process. Any updates on how the pipeline looks and any sort of initial expectations for Jan 1?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Jeff Alter?","Jeff Alter","It's Jeff Alter. What we've seen over the last few years is that the clients in this marketplace are really looking for a long-term partner who can deliver practical innovations, like our health care cost estimator and our mobility platform, coupled with distinctive service and new models of outreach to help their employees navigate the health care system in an easier way. And they're really looking for that long-term partner who can manage their benefits and their medical trend even more important during this time of enormous change. And we performed really well over the last couple of years with this stack up. We continue to perform well. We still have -- although I know your question was '13, but we still have over 500,000 members in this space to bring up between now and 1\/1\/13. And then it is early. And we're in the middle of the selling season for 2013. But all indications are that our past success will continue in the 1\/1 season.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So you guys were up somewhere in the ballpark of 800,000 in the first quarter. Is that sort of your baseline run rate target? Or is there anything that indicates next year will be better or worse than what we saw this year?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Josh, we're not offering 2013 guidance today. So I think we'll -- I would just say I think the market -- our service to that market continues to be strong, and we'll comment on 2013 when we get to the Investor Conference. Okay?","So I think we should close now. I would hope that you would take away a few key points. First, that UnitedHealth Group continued to deliver a performance in the second quarter and for the first half of '12. But we remain focused and realistic considering the challenging economic and market environment that we face today. Second, we continue to focus on providing consistent value, innovation and dependable execution on behalf of the customers and consumers in everything we do. We remain committed to improving quality and access, while helping to contain the rising cost of care so that health care experience is simpler and more affordable. And lastly, we look to the -- looking to the future, we see markets expanding steadily for health benefits and exponentially for health services. So while we acknowledge the increasing competitive and regulatory pressures ahead, we believe our adaptable, diversified businesses are well positioned to grow the market and that we'll continue to grow and to prosper over the long term.","We thank you very much for your attention today.

I will be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 16, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Hemsley","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we are going to continue in our efforts to keep our formal remarks brief, allowing more time to respond to your questions. We are also going to freshen things up a little and share portion of today's formal commentary between Dave Wichmann, our President; and Larry Renfro, our Vice Chairman. I'll start out with the recap of the quarter.","Net earnings in the quarter grew 33% to $1.46 per share on revenues of $35.8 billion. What is important is what lies inside these results. Higher revenue growth, more consistent performance in operating discipline, and margins strength across UnitedHealth Group's broad , strategically diversified set of businesses.","Operating cash flows were $2.3 billion for the quarter, 1.6x net income. Revenue and earnings performance from UnitedHealthcare were the biggest contributors to better than expected first quarter cash flow.","This quarter builds on the second half 2014 momentum we discussed with you before. We expect that momentum to continue with second quarter earnings per share growing nicely from this past quarter's results and being modestly above current consensus estimates.","At this range, we see second and third quarter earnings being more even stronger in the second quarter and lighter in the third and current consensus would suggest this pattern would better fit our current business trends and outlook.","We are advancing our 2015 full year outlook taking revenues to $143 billion, a $2 billion increase and a nearly 10% year-over-year growth pace. Net per share earnings advanced to a new tighter range of $6.15 to $6.30 per share, and an 11% year-over-year gain at the upper end, despite absorbing $0.10 per share and attributed to Catamaran transaction cost and the impact of reducing our level of share repurchase going forward. The increase in revenue and earnings modestly improves our outlook for cash flow from operations by $200 million on the lower end of the new range of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion.","Now, I'll ask Larry to review Optum. Then ask Dave to pickup with UnitedHealthcare and some UnitedHealth Group better price items. Larry?","Larry Renfro","Thanks Dave. Optum's revenues grew 14.7% to $12.8 billion in the quarter, with operating margins stable year-over-year at 5.8% despite more than 30 basis points of acquisition costs.","Optum's earnings from operations grew 14% to $742 million in the quarter with every reporting unit producing double-digit percentage earnings growth. Catamaran acquisition costs reduced Optum's year-over-year earnings growth by seven percentage points in the quarter. Setting aside these transactions costs, Optum would have produced 21% earnings growth for the quarter.","We expect Optum to post strong earnings growth in 2015 and after fully absorbing Catamaran acquisition costs, we continue to forecast operating earnings within the range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion.","This will be growth of at least 50% over two years from a base of less than $2.5 billion in 2013. We continue to build our capabilities in important ways this quarter, particularly our relationships starting with Catamaran.","The proposed Catamaran combination brings obvious benefits to the markets and customers we serve. It will create a competitively scaled channel-agnostic PBM focused on growing and serving all prescription market segments.","It will advance the next generation\u2019s synchronized PBM where all clinical data points are connected and drug considerations are fully integrated with clinical care processes to produce better outcomes and better overall cost trends.","This will be important as the age of specialty pharma emerges along with inevitable biosimilar counterparts. People will be served better, benefit and program sponsors will benefit from both the more progressive synchronized care offering as well as from sharing the meaningful savings achieved from combining these two enterprises.","Integration disruption can be avoided, since the two companies already share a common technology. We believe this can quickly becomes the next generation, clinically-informed, clinically-anchored PBM.","Looking forward, our Optum team is driving meaningful growth in customer pipeline for all Optum business segments. Optum's external revenue backlog grew 24% in the quarter to drive overall backlog to over $9 billion.","Optum continues to develop broader relationships with more sophisticated clients who need end-to-end solutions to the complex challenges they face. For example, Optum 360 has added sizeable and distinguished new partners, most notably North Shore-LIJ Health System and the Mayo Clinic.","And in the U.K., Optum International became one of the very few organizations to be accredited to serve under the NHS lead provider framework as the NHS procures an expected $1 billion of commissioning support annually.","Optum labs recently added Yale University as a partner and research from the lab has now been accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the British Medical Journal.","Finally this quarter, we launched an important new brand campaign for Optum to help further build understanding of our services and innovation.","Now let me turn it over to Dave.","Dave Wichmann","Thank you, Larry. Turning first to UnitedHealthcare, first quarter revenues grew 11.5% to $32.6 billion, net operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 5.8% reflecting strong performances in all businesses commercial, Medicaid, Medicare, and global.","Each of the first quarter care ratios improved year-over-year and were better than our plans for the quarter. The combination of strong growth across of all diversified benefits business and even more effective medical and operating cost performance produced a 35% increase in UnitedHealthcare's quarterly earnings from operations to $1.9 billion.","The headline for UnitedHealthcare in the quarter is growth, growing organically to serve 1 million more people in the United States in the first quarter alone and 1.6 million more people year-over-year with notable strength this quarter in the seniors and commercial businesses.","We are increasing our projections for organic growth and domestic medical benefits by about 600,000 people from our investor conference outlook to approximately 1.4 million people in 2015. The increased outlook is driven by stronger market response to our expanding commercial benefits product portfolio.","In the first quarter, UnitedHealthcare's commercial business grew nicely serving 680,000 more people. Growth included 570,000 public exchange consumers well ahead of our expectations. In our earnings outlook and as we have said before, we do not expect meaningful financial contributions from these customers in 2015.","On the international side, UnitedHealthcare is underwriting and pricing to create both sustainable customer value and sustainable margins and is scaling to deliver results. Amil our Brazilian Healthcare Company produced improved financial results on a better mix of business with revenues growing 12% year-over-year on a local currency basis.","Medicaid membership exceeded plan even with the expected decreases in Tennessee where the state introduced a third plan into the market. UnitedHealthcare grew its Medicare businesses in the first quarter by another 380,000 people split pretty evenly between Medicare Advantage and supplemental benefits.","Two weeks ago CMS issued its final Medicare Advantage rate notice for 2016, while these rates will help provide some needed stability for seniors who continue to enroll in Medicare Advantage in record numbers, the rates simply did not keep up the pace of medical cost increases. We will continue to make the case on behalf of the millions of seniors we served for sound and stable approaches to Medicare Advantage funding in the future.","Before we sum up, let me run through a short punch list of non-financial highlights for the quarter for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. During the quarter we invested in brands and reputation broadly across UnitedHealth Group including the brand campaign Larry mentioned for Optum and the successful introduction of UnitedHealthcare's own fresh branding effort. Both have generated favorable responses and we will build on these throughout the year.","We are getting scaled market traction on several innovation efforts, Rally our digital consumer health platform now reaches nearly 9 million Americans across the broad spectrum of employers, health plans and associations, and as improving consumer engagement we plan to expand to nearly 30 million people by this time next year including consumers in Brazil.","Link, the secured cloud based workspace for care providers now reaches nearly 425,000 care providers and expect to reach 600,000 or more by this time next year. We continue to advance higher quality, lower cost care with our delivery system partners on behalf of those we serve. Medical spending under value based arrangements grew nearly 30% year-over-year to nearly $40 billion annual run rate. This was an active quarter in terms of acquisition and capital deployment, we will fund these efforts from internal resources and debt and we had maintained our credit ratings.","And lastly the UnitedHealth Foundation continues to engage in a focused manner with communities in need. As example, the foundation recently announced substantial support for an innovative community care program in Maricopa County Arizona, pioneering medical education and services in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and a technology initiative in Tennessee that connects patients with care professionals through community health centers via telemedicine.","And OptumRx crossed the $10 million milestone in prescription drugs donated to Community Health clinics in Kansas. Steve?","Stephen Hemsley","Thanks, David. So as we look forward I hope you sense an acceleration on a broad and disciplined set of initiatives. So as we look forward I hope you sense an acceleration on a broad and discipline set of initiatives in our consumer capabilities, brand and reputation for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum payment reform and progressive services to better support care providers, innovation and its more meaningful larger scale market deployment, strategic M&A, large, far-reaching next-generation strategic relationships, information driven research in social and philanthropic efforts aligned to the communities we serve.","And all these funds and more we intend to pick up our pace with thoughtful urgency and improve performance and consistency. So as we grow we become a more effective enabler of a better healthcare system and serve more people with better outcomes to the prudent use of society\u2019s healthcare resources.","And now to recap, our 2015 outlook for $143 billion in revenues accelerates our revenue growth rate to nearly 10% this year, with improvements coming from both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Our earnings outlook of $6.15 to $6.30 per share includes $0.03 per share of transaction cost this quarter from Catamaran and an additional $0.07 per share of pressure over the balance of this year principally due to repurchasing less than half of the UnitedHealth Group shares we had targeted before this combination.","For 2016 we continue to project core earnings growth and that the Catamaran combination will be $0.30 per share accretive to those earnings, even while carrying $0.20 per share in amortization expenses. Savings and accretion are expected to grow further in 2017 and 2018 improving value for customers and earnings visibility for shareholders for a multi year period.","Today, we continue to have strong access to capital in both the equity and debt markets. We believe we can continue to participate positively and fully as both the health benefits and health services markets continue to evolve both domestically and internationally. And we remained focused on developing and expanding our capabilities and businesses both for UnitedHealthcare and Optum as market opportunities present themselves.","We expect to maintain our approach to advancing our dividend to more market based levels exactly as we have discussed this area of capital allocation with you previously, no changes are contemplated in that respect.","With that, I thank you and we will now open up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks, good morning. Just interested if you could give us some perspectives on what you are seeing in terms of PMPM Healthcare utilization in the quarter, which seemed with MLRs improving across the segment that it remains well controlled, but it\u2019s clear there\u2019s been some conflicting data points out there showing that there maybe has been some broader market increases to utilization, HCA pre-announcing yesterday for example with strong admission volumes.","So, just interested in your perspectives on what you are seeing with utilization and how to sync across some of those different data points we're seeing?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure Scott. I think Dan Schumacher can best respond to that.","Dan Schumacher","Good morning Scott, thanks for the question. I guess I wouldn't comment specifically on PMPMs, but I would say that in the quarter we were very pleased with our medical cost performance.","As we talked about at the Investor Conference, as we formulated our forward trend outlook and we thought about how we priced and positioned our benefits for 2015, we assume that we thought it made sense to assume a moderate increase in underlying utilization.","And I\u2019ll tell you in the first quarter there has not been any acceleration in underlying utilization. I think we've done well as an organization through our focused medical cost management initiatives, and also I think we're seeing benefits from greater consumer responsibility as well as, as we continue to drive greater concentrations as Dave mentioned in value based reimbursements.","So as we look at the balance of the year, we expect our full year commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, and I would orient you towards the lower half of that range.","Stephen Hemsley","And I think we have pretty good visibility on that, we have daily census, so I think maybe some of things that are coming forward might have something to do with fact that 18 more million people have coverage and are using the system in a more structured way than the past, and I think that maybe a factor in what you\u2019re seeing Scott. Next question please?","Operator","And we can take the next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Michael Baker","Yes thanks a lot. Given the pending purchase of Catamaran, I was wondering if you could give us a better sense or more color around your approach to differentiate on specialty pharmacy management and then any willingness by the PBM consultant community to change their approach to scoring vendors given the change from pharmacy benefit management to drug benefit management?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure I think that's a great question, and I will have Larry pick it up, but particularly the strength of OptumRx\u2019s synchronization efforts to really able to connect data, target individuals, engage them particularly as specialty pharma emerges, it really is a tremendous opportunity for us to distinguish ourselves, and the cost of that category is such that it would be hard for us to believe that the customer community as well as the consultant community will not be sensitized to that category of cost. Larry?","Larry Renfro","Hi Mike, it's Larry Renfro, and I'm going to start and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Tim Wicks, who is currently the CEO of OptumRx soon to be the President of the new OptumRx, and I will have him comment on specialty, but maybe I can start by giving you a little bit of our thought process as we put the two companies together.","We really looked at I know where the value was going to be and we really had five categories, number one would be scale, number two would be enhanced technology, three would be distinctive capability such as specialty and synchronization and we\u2019ll comment on specialty as you ask.","Number four would be our - we end up with a well-rounded management team from both a - what I'll call relationship sales as well as operations, customer service, and then the complementary businesses that kind of line up all together.","So that\u2019s kind of how we went at this . Obviously specialty is a very, very important aspect of going forward in the future as we talked about earlier in the script. So I\u2019m going to hand this off to Tim now and he will give you some thoughts.","Timothy Wicks","Great, thank you. Thank you, Larry. Michael first of all we welcome scoring related to drug costs as opposed to simply straight up pharmacy discount rates, and what differentiates us in the specialty pharmacy area and why we\u2019re competitive first of all relates to trend management and work that we do around trend management and it really gets to all of the levers around synchronization and what we do to integrate medical, clinical, and lab data with pharmacy data and to be able to bring that to bear to surround the consumer with all of those capabilities that help them make better decisions, help them be adherent to their drug regimen, and to be able to engage and program to help them improve their health.","We also think that the approach that we take to site of care and being agnostic as to whether the specialty drug is managed in the medical benefit or the pharmacy benefit is very important and then we also take advantage of site-of-care management so that we are agnostic to that as well and we drive it to the best place of care for the consumer.","Michael Baker","Thanks for the update.","Dave Wichmann","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Windley","Hi, maybe a follow-up on the Catamaran thought process, so Larry your 8% margin goal for next year, there is I think you and John have talked about there maybe some variance in how you progress towards that goal depending on the mix of business, obviously Catamaran brings in a pretty significant shift in the mix of that business. Could you talk about how that affects your thoughts and your trajectory toward that 8% margin goal?","Larry Renfro","Sure that's good point. I\u2019m going to ask John to speak to this as well. We had this goal of 8\/16 and there were some various factors or components that we needed to really make as part of that overall goal.","First thing was what you are coming on is 8% by 2016. We also said that we would double 2013 earnings of $2.5 billion by 2018, we said we would have 8 to 10 large more complex relationships and that we would have double-digit top and bottom line growth through 2016.","So I\u2019m going to define that as kind of core business, kind of pre-Catamaran and I would tell you that everything from a financial standpoint is in line or ahead of expectations. So we\u2019re going to continue to track our core business that way as far as the 8\/16 goal that we set now.","As you know the blend has changed with what we\u2019ve done in this transaction, so we\u2019re going to be handling a lot more pharmaceutical business, so that\u2019s going to change the mix and I\u2019m going to let John talk about that.","John Rex","David this is John. So as Larry stated our 2015 performance to-date which show us solidly tracking to that 8\/16 goal and we are very much committed to that 8\/16 goal we put up as we think about our base businesses and how that configures.","When we plan as an organization, we plan for organic growth and that is how we got to configure our objectives and how we point the organization.","So clearly that 8\/16 is very much focused on our core businesses organic growth, we are tracking to that and we are still completely committed to that.","Certainly your point is well taken adding an excess of $20 billion of pharmacy care services revenue changes the mix and I would expect that to change the mix as we think about kind of a 16 and where that lands.","But we as an organization are completely committed to 8\/16 on the core businesses and that's where we will be tracking on the core base ex the impact of the additional pharmacy care services revenue.","And then the merger will dilute that down but you will stay on track for your core commitments on the core business.","David Windley","Okay great.","Larry Renfro","So thanks for that question, next one please.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. I was impressed with the guidance particularly after observing the Catamaran cost and I think it's the first time United boosted guidance early in the year since 2012, can you talk about the level of confidence you have heading into the year as it is maybe greater or there is less unknowns than the last few years that led you to in earlier guidance boost and any headwinds or tailwinds that you could light up for us that would be helpful. Thank you.","Larry Renfro","I\u2019m so more confused, I don\u2019t think we are doing anything differently in terms of this, we - I think kind of update our outlook every quarter, we have seen enough strength and growth in the businesses across the board to improve that guidance slightly and to absorb the costs associated with Catamaran and the adjustment to our share repurchase given that transaction.","So we thought that that was appropriate to include in the update and beyond that I don\u2019t think we are changing anything else along those lines.","We typically if we see that consensus estimates don't necessarily line up with exactly with way we are seeing our quarter-by-quarter roll out, we typically comment on that and if again done that this quarter. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything differently this quarter along those lines.","So, and if we did - if you're picking up anything we didn\u2019t intend anything behalf of what we said. So can you help me with what you think has changed.","Sarah James","I just saw the EPS increase was bigger this year than first quarter of the last few years, but maybe if you could just spike out the headwinds and tailwinds as we see them for 2015?","Stephen Hemsley","Well I think that in terms of our business I think our outlook is actually pretty positive I think that we\u2019re seeing growth across our businesses, I think we had nice momentum as we came out of 2014 and of kind of carry that into 2015.","When we take a look at strength of the businesses, I think our Medicare offerings are stronger this year. And we've had I think what we expected to be in terms of first quarter growth there.","The Medicaid business continues to be very strong maybe a little stronger than what we have thought in the beginning we knew we were going to lose portion of the state of tendency but our other growth kind of pulled that to virtually even strong growth in the commercial business.","So we had nice growth across UnitedHealthcare and we\u2019ve had continued strong growth across Optum Amil as showing some initial signs of strengthening and recovering, they've done a nice job down there and they have really done I think an exceptional job of embracing some of the best breed of what both the organizations do.","So, along those lines I think we have mostly a positives. We continue to - we had hoped for stronger MA rates and funding I think that will be a consistent thing. We continue to work on our improving our business and our business disciplines, but I do think we\u2019re making very good progress on medical cost management, operating cost.","So across the Board as I go through the inventory, I think we're - I believe in a stronger place than we have been in sometime and the first quarter results pulled that through and so we\u2019ve updated an outlook and I wouldn\u2019t suggest it\u2019s anything more than that. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker","Thanks, good morning. So you clearly saw a good success and exchange enrollment beyond your initial expectations. Maybe you could just discuss the factors around pricing and product design in your minds that led the enrollment success. And also maybe any early reads on those exchange lines versus your expectations. Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure it's still early, but I have Jeff Alter, maybe comment on that. Thanks.","Jeff Alter","Good morning Andy, it\u2019s Jeff Alter. As we kind took you through our plans starting back in 2013 of how we were going to view the exchanges and look at 2014 as the year of learning and build kind of quickly rapidly as the market developed, I think the results that we saw in that in our initial enrollment year of 2015, one of result of kind of that longer term strategic plan and we - as we mentioned during our Investor Conference really looked hard at how people bought what they were buying, what was successful and designs, product and networks that could create price points that were sustainable over the long-term.","And I think as you look at where we got our membership, it tie very nicely to where we said we thought we would get on membership and maybe we just got slightly more in those markets.","So I think it was result of long-term strategic plan around this emerging market and the results of a lot of hard work to create the product and the networks that could support price points that people were looking to buy at.","So that's something that drove first quarter. I'd also say that what also drove our first quarter results were stronger performance in our key account block particularly around persistency or retaining existing clients as we went through our fourth quarter and into our first quarter.","We retained more clients than we had in the past and then we've also expanded our product portfolio around some of the work that we did for exchanges, we also did stretch that into newer well priced product offerings for our small business and some of our 51 to 99 business.","And we saw those results begin to emerge in the fourth quarter of 2014 and strengthen into 2015.","Stephen Hemsley","So, I think the balance performance overall and in the exchange right products in the right market is pretty much as we expected and we knew back in January that the market was responding positively so it's played out nicely. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Thanks, good morning, I appreciate the call. Could you guys talk a little about $0.20 of guidance was sort of exclude the $0.10 of cost that you guys were absorbing, but the $0.20 of core earnings.","And what the drivers are of that increase how much of that is the benefits business versus Optum and I guess within that how much of that is commercial versus government. And I guess further within that how much of that is MLR related and what you guys were seeing in both segment?","Dave Wichmann","Hi Josh, it\u2019s Dave. Thank you for your questions and it's very good one. So we\u2019ve increased our guidance by 10% on average and then we\u2019re including an additional $0.10 of cost associated with the transaction with Catamaran and then also the impacted, reduced share repurchase.","I'd say the number one contributor to our performance improvement expectations here is growth and I think it shows through pretty strongly across all of the benefits businesses with the particular emphasis on the over performance in commercial.","But what you probably don\u2019t see in that is you see the lived on the insurance exchange what you probably don\u2019t see is the over performance on the off exchange business, which has been very strong as well.","Jeff and his team has done a very nice job there. So I kind of edge that more towards a commercial. And then in terms of other profit contributors would be our performance on MLR and we expected to improve our MLR during this year as we said forth both in both the Investor Conference as well as on the fourth quarter call.","But we have clearly outperformed that this year as well. And I\u2019d say that that\u2019s due to the strength of the performance on several fronts mark clinical engagement strategies and our ability to manage medical cost the trend components that Dan, referred earlier as well with respect to our performing on impatient management overall is a I think was a key factor as well.","And then you can also see in Larry\u2019s prepared remarks that Optum prepares to or expects to over perform as well absorbing the cost of the Catamaran transaction and still hitting the expected range of performance that laid out in the conference as well in the fourth quarter call.","So, I think overall you\u2019re seeing a strong performance and it\u2019s coming from multiple different front supporting the 20%, the $0.20 improvement in our overall guidance.","Josh Raskin","Is it fair to say then Dave, maybe two-thirds of the improvement is the benefits business and then the third is Optum?","Dave Wichmann","Yeah, I\u2019d say that there\u2019s some it\u2019s there plus or minus overall, but yeah I think that\u2019s fair.","Stephen Hemsley","Two-third 64 we couldn\u2019t calibrate it, but what\u2019s great is it is balanced then I think that\u2019s the strength of the kind of the diversified model, but so all the businesses are contributing to that advance.","And if we continue to execute appropriately we\u2019re hoping to do better so. Next question please. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Sheryl Skolnick","Good morning. Congratulations to everybody by my count this has been right rather an extraordinary quarter with double-digit revenue growth and strong operating income growth across all of the business units.","But we\u2019ve been kind of talking about them separately with really key important factors that I\u2019d like to focus on being the retention the cost management, and that you have mentioned and you have talked about.","As well as the synergies of synchronization of the business the opportunity do that on the Optum side and what I\u2019m getting at is that there was the change in the company back in November there\u2019s been change building over the last several years.","Now we\u2019re seeing results I don\u2019t think that was an accident I think those things are to very clearly related issues. I\u2019m sensing you are at scale, I\u2019m sensing the business is transforming, and my question therefore is can you talk about what changed in the way you manage this business to get all of these many parts and pieces that are so strong to work together now better perhaps and also in the future and does that means that this sort of performance should be more sustainable.","Stephen Hemsley","Well, I'll start and so my colleagues can join in on this but I would kind of say dramatically that we have been endeavoring to perform at these levels and interest level of consistency for sometime.","It is not just a factor of internal average efforts, I think there are market, external market factors that putting pressures to bear as well. So, we bear some of the responsibility for - if we so optimize our performance and some of it is due to kind of external market dynamics and pressures.","But I think that for the last couple years, we have been endeavoring to really make the business work together on a more optimal level across the enterprise. It has been the function of trying to drive a better culture, it has been a function of trying to achieve a strong chemistry among senior managements and kind of effort where we are working together and, helping each other with both their challenges and opportunities.","And I do think this is a very strong group of people who are committed to working together and to optimizing the performance that are really focused on serving customers, consumers, care providers really focused outside and making sure that we are delivering on the promise of enabling the better healthcare system and really helping people live healthy alive and get access and services to facilitate that.","And I just think that has come together and it is an effort so it is not sustaining as making sure that we keep doing this. And I do think that there is a stronger chemistry among the teem today and emerging, maturing leadership group across the board and I say its board based, I would say its not three or four people, I would say its 75 or 100 people across the Board.","And I think that - I think people make a difference and I think that\u2019s been part of it. I think we\u2019ve also been focused on that culture to make sure that we are collaborating effectively and focusing on serving the markets. So I think those things have played into it and we'll look around \u2013 Dirk McMahon would like to try add to this.","Dirk McMahon","So Sheryl, its Dirk, how\u2019re you doing. A good example is the advocate for me call model, that was a joint effort plus Optum and UHC with Optum handling the clinical pieces. If you look at what we are doing with our service offerings making sure our digital offerings get consistent, making sure all of our customer communications are clear and cognized and simple, those things coordinate across the enterprise \u2013 that's a good example in the case we\u2019re managing across.","Stephen Hemsley","And I think the decisions, the way we go about making decisions and how we choose leaders in the organization are really built on more focused on collaborating and being ambitious to make sure the enterprise performs for those who we serve and so I take a lot of factors that are may be intangible to have contributed to that and I think you just have seen some of the effort start to emerge and I think we can do better.","So I\u2019m hoping this is the - you\u2019re seeing that the beginning of what we can do going forward but we have to keep working on it. Thanks for the question. Next please?","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hello everybody. I'm going to follow up with another Catamaran consolidation question. I guess the $0.30 an EPS accretion that we\u2019re looking for next year, I assume that\u2019s after as plowing back some of the opportunity for the underlying customer base, so assume that the overall opportunity from putting the two together is more than what we've reflected in the $0.30.","Can you give us some flavor of what might be ploughed back to combine entities clients. And then one of the issues that\u2019s been raised and I want you just have you comment on it, is the Catamaran has a lot of health plan members or clients and I know in Optum like OptumInsight has a lot of business with other health plans, you just comment on how that relationship works, I know there seems to be some concern that people may view as competitor but how has your experience been in Optum working with other health plans?","Stephen Hemsley","Sure, well there is several in there, I might, it is premature for us to get specific about elements related to transaction that is still really subject to approval and so forth but kind of somatically I would offer that the accretion is really more a function of the transaction itself.","The capital we deployed relative to the cost of that capital against the earnings stream of Catamaran as it is, we are clearly focused on driving the overwhelming majority of the benefits and synergies that arise from this back to customers, improving the value proposition, improving and progressing a PBM model that is distinctive in the marketplace.","And we are really focused on the customers benefiting principally from that of which UnitedHealthcare is a customer as well but also as you point out very important customers that are other payors in the marketplace, very, very good companies and those relationships are clearly important and vital to this model going forward.","And we are committed delivering on all commitments related to that and really developing and delivering a supporting capability to their PBM strategies so that we produce for them, a distinctive capability and advantage into the marketplace and to meet their specifications as they see it and become a very trusted partner in this category. ","I think we are a trusted partner in this category - for a variety of payors and care providers across the spectrum in Optum and our business has continued to grow and evolve there and Larry, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that.","Larry Renfro","Hi, A.J, it\u2019s Larry. So good point that you made and good question and we live this everyday and I will kind of reiterate almost everything Steve just said but obviously, I have spoken to quite a few of the customers but may be what you want to think back a little bit is frame what we do today. ","If you look at OptumHealth and you look at OptumInsight you would plan that if we have internal and external customers that\u2019s pretty balanced between the internal and external breakdown.","If you look at what\u2019s really happening with the Catamaran transaction, it will get very close to being balanced as well but some of the things that we heard as we talked to the existing clients and so forth that this is what Steve said is that, the reason we bought and entered into this combination with Catamaran was because we needed to scale. ","We needed enhanced technology, we needed specialty and synchronization programs, we needed well grounded management team and as a result complementary business that same reasons that people want to do business with us, they have those same interest and that\u2019s why we believe we really marry up really, really well with this new model.","Now some of the things that we\u2019re going to have to do is we\u2019re going to have to execute. We\u2019re going to have to execute day one as we get involved with new customers. ","We\u2019re going to have to live up to commitments that have been made and we know that and we\u2019re pretty good at that. This going to have to be total transparency, today we do business with 300 health plans, we do business with 4,500 hospitals.","So we\u2019re used to really working with a lot of people and having to have transparency and this is just going to be another aspect of it.","Obviously privacy and security around information and data and we\u2019re going to have to come up with the way that we believe this is going to be pretty easy with no disruption because we are on the same technology platform and we\u2019ve been on that platform for about 10 years. ","So overall we feel pretty good about this transaction but I think if you went back and you looked at what we do in OptumHealth, you would find that lot of these clients already clients of ours and they already work with us in various intervention and prevention and wellness programs.","You would find the same with OptumInsight. So overall, we kind of know this model and I would say as long as we execute and as long as we execute and as long as we execute we should be fine.","A.J. Rice","All right, great thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, may be if I can ask similar question in a little bit different way, when we think about the accretion of $0.30, my understanding is that it\u2019s versus not deploying the capital else but you\u2019ve already kind of talked about a $0.07 headwind so far this year from cutting back on share repurchase and I guess that you can do that again next year to bring leverage back down.","How do you think about kind of the net accretion versus, if you had continued your previous capital deployment plan in 2016 and then I understand the concept of returning the overwhelming majority of the benefits back to the customers but usually we don\u2019t think of year one as being the high watermark from an accretion perspective, I mean where does that $0.30 number go to in year two and year three?","Stephen Hemsley","Well, first of all we\u2019re not providing that level of guidance in particularly at this early stage but we think that, this deployment of capital is compelling relative to the market opportunities.","And I think the capabilities we can bring to the marketplace, so we think that this business will continue to grow, we think that will become a more effective serving customers and it will become more affected as a business and particularly in the market dynamics that we see ahead as specialty pharma continues to emerge in the marketplace whether it\u2019s going to require greater information, greater clinical engagement.","So we think this is a very good use of capital that will be a important business broadly for the marketplace, serving all sectors of the markets that where prescriptions are engaged.","And we expect this to grow, so we don\u2019t expect this accretion to flatten out or trend, we expect the business to actually improve year-by-year and so we would expect that contribution to grow and would grow we think much more than would be a share buyback if that\u2019s what you\u2019re using it as an example.","Our orientation to deploying capital is to find growth opportunities aligned with our strategic capabilities and that is our priority in terms of deploying capital, paying dividends and share buyback is really, when we really have excess capital if you will to bear. So we are very pleased with this and we can - we\u2019ll continue to look for investment opportunities not only in this area but in our other Optum services and in our benefits businesses where we think there would may be opportunities down the road. I don\u2019t know if that gets to your Larry.","Larry Renfro","Sure, Kevin I\u2019ll get little more granular and may be this is not were, you were going but I\u2019m can\u2019t been held responsible here for that $0.30 in 2016 and the way that I look at it, you\u2019ve got some factors that we have to pay attention to very, very carefully right now such as client retention, such as sales, such as our operating leverage, our customer service and our management.","All of these things that we really have control of inside of Optum and how we manage the business and with the combination of Catamaran, who has the strong management team, who has strong experience, strong relationships, this is a very, very strong management team and so we feel confident on lot of levers that we can use and pull to go towards that $0.30.","Now I\u2019m not even talking about network discounts and I\u2019m not talking about drugs \u2013 at this point of time because as we talked about some of these categories will go back to others and our clients as we work with them.","So we\u2019re confident from what I call operating plan standpoint, what we have to do by 2016.","Stephen Hemsley","Thanks for the question and next question please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold","Hi. At your Investor Day you indicated you expect to achieve your long-term earnings growth target of 13% to 16% in 2016 recognizing now that the 2015 EPS is going to be higher than your expected. Is that objective still on track and as you look into 2016, you mentioned that rates are keeping up with cost trends in Medicare, could you comment on your other lines of business how you see headwinds, tailwinds? Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Sure. The other lines of business I\u2019ll ask Jeff, Austin, and Steve maybe to respond in terms of our overall, we are not changing our outlook with respect to our long-term growth trends or with no intention of suggesting that.","We still feel confident that in the long-term our businesses are capable of producing growth in that range and we are hopefully seeing our performance start to recover back into that range.","So as it relates to the individual businesses maybe I\u2019ll start with Steve Nelson.","Steve Nelson","Thanks Steve. Hi Christine, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. With respect to the Medicare business, it\u2019s really well positioned for 2000 now and will even increasingly improve for 2016 to serve more seniors which is really our objective provide not just better benefits but great health outcomes and a better healthcare experience.","And I\u2019ll just tell you how kind of we think about that as we are in - as you know in the midst of our 2016 benefit planning period. We have now shaped our networks in a really meaningful way, we have added premiums under half of our total membership as premium which was an important transition and something that we needed to do and executed that this year making great progress on starts, we have really strong clinical programs and customer service innovations and improvement that not only as I said provide benefits but create a better healthcare experience for our members.","And we have great market share and brand position, so when you couple this with the growth of the population and increased propensity to choose Medicare advantage over fee-for-service it is really strong position and very positive outlook. Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Good morning Christine, it's Jeff Alter. I think the commercial business shares very positive view of the future, we've been through a tough couple of years with lot of headwinds, lot of disruptions from the ACA which tend to - I think our ability to manage trend better than some others.","And I think as we go into 2015, 2016 and beyond kind of the combined power of Optum healthcare working together to keep trends lower, keep our pricing lower. I think you should expect the growth that we\u2019ve had over the last six months or so to really be what distinguishes us going forward and that\u2019s delivering more and more value to the marketplace through different product designs but more important over the long run better management of cost and delivering that better management back through lower pricing and growth to the marketplace.","Austin Pittman","Good morning, this is Austin. Strong momentum continues in our Medicaid business, we are very honored to continue to see strong growth, we look for that growth to continue throughout the year and into the future.","Really built on very strong relationships with our state partners, strong clinical programs focused on getting better outcomes, high quality outcomes for the constituents and overall I think we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate over time and partnership with those states value.","And that sustained value we think is what really continues to create that momentum moving forward.","Stephen Hemsley","So I think pretty solid across the board in terms of and the Optum business continues to be strong, the backlog pipeline and Optum continues to grow and revenue backlog continues to grow actually at a faster pace than what we\u2019re actually showing in our reported results, so pretty positive in that regard.","We\u2019ll take maybe two more questions, so the next one please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks good morning. I was wondering on this Optum UHC better together is that strengthened or less strong if you will post to Catamaran transaction. And how would that be informed by your 2016, 2017 selling season and are there any other milestones that might inform one decision versus the other?","Stephen Hemsley","I would say just in broadly that kind of coming back to an earlier question that I think the chemistry and the operating dynamics across the businesses continue to mature and get better I think we have a very strong generation of leaders here and they\u2019re working together.","In terms of this particular transaction, a lot of work done at the corporate level in terms of the actual developing and execution of a transaction of this caliber and then working with the Optum team and the OptumRx team that has been probably the orientation at this point in time.","So I would say that as it relates to that transaction, I think it was our - I think we\u2019ve really good capabilities at our corporate development, organization are - treasury organization and so forth and then they take the business expertise from the Optum team really where our PBM resides.","So that is probably in - that flavor was probably played out more in that. But I would tell you that the better together dynamic across our businesses has never play \u2013actually been better and as I said earlier, I think and certainly it\u2019s our intent that this is just the beginning. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take the next question from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sean Wieland","Thank you. Long time listener, first time caller, thanks for taking my question. So this week you said the Optum360 and Mayo is getting together. Mayo as you know is also embarking on their implementation of APAC. So that\u2019s a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Can you comment on the value proposition to Mayo given their simultaneous rollout of APAC and how you\u2019re going to manage this? And also can you tell us what the organic growth wise in the OptumHealth business. Thanks.","Stephen Hemsley","Well welcome Sean, and maybe Bill Miller can touch on Mayo and John perhaps your last question.","Bill Miller","Yes Sean, this is Bill, I\u2019ll answer the implementation work going on down at APAC. It's a very insightful question, because that is a lot of things going on. And it was instrumental and part of the discussion as we arrived at our relationship with Mayo, because what we'll do is working concert with them with respect to their rollout of APAC.","But if they evaluated that, and they looked at our tools, the combination of our tools working with their existing systems and the systems that they\u2019re going to install, they felt like they wanted to move ahead, because they were independent and the best in the market as they saw them.","And there were other things that we're going to work on collectively that I think enhance Mayo's position around patient engagement and some other things that they want to sort with from a consumer perspective, which we\u2019re going to work with them particularly in the context of revenue management.","So, they\u2019re comfortable with the so called cooks in the kitchen. We\u2019ll collaborate in that context and there is not that much overlap and where there is we\u2019ve accounted forward in the project plan. So we feel very comfortable about going forward.","John Rex","Yes Sean, this is John Rex. So OptumHealth did have a very good top line growth in the quarter that you noted 27% top line growth. I would say all the businesses contributing if I would have call out certain businesses in terms of where we saw particular strength that I want to note on the call and call at the OptumCare businesses.","So those are the care delivery businesses certainly one of the big five drivers that we talked about extensively at the Investor Day back in December in terms of where our focus was over the next five years. Driving that growth it was really a growth in patients served in our existing markets. It was also de novo expansion new market expansion really heavily along those areas in terms of driving the vast majority of growth with OptumHealth for the quarter.","Stephen Hemsley","So to just to sum up the quarter, the story is really again about growth, growth in revenues, earnings based on more consistent performance for customers, growth in the number of people we partner with and serve across the healthcare system.","And growth in the scope and diversity of our businesses. So we thank you and we\u2019ll see you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's program and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day."],"21216":["UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (NYSE:UNH) Q1 2016 Earnings Call April 19, 2016  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Stephen J.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws.

A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

Please go ahead.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016.","UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momentum is evident in the highest levels of customer and consumer retention in our history combined with new customer acquisitions driving strong revenue gains across the enterprise; growth in the size, scope and diversity of products and services within our client base as well as a number of new customer opportunities we are pursuing; steadily improving metrics for brand and reputation and steadily rising net promoter scores across our businesses. Customers buy value and expect results and we are sharpening our performance focus, driving the highest quality customer experiences, helping us become the go-to choice, a must-have partner for everyone looking to improve performance and sustainability in health benefits and health services.","When we combine higher quality from consistent excellent execution with practical innovations at scale, our opportunities to grow and serve continue to expand. Our intensified commitments to quality performance and to growth on the strength of that quality positions UnitedHealth Group to look forward toward what we believe may become our best decade of performance and growth yet.","Turning to the results, we are reporting today our first quarter revenues grew 9% prior to acquisitions and over 24% overall to $44.5 billion with broad strength across the enterprise. In health benefits, medical costs were well managed and controlled as is evident in the consolidated care ratio of 81.7%. Prior-year reserves developed favorably by $360 million in the quarter; the medical days claims payable increased four days year over year to 51 days. Cash flows of $2.3 billion or 1.4 times net income continued at a strong and reliable pace.","First quarter's operating cost ratio decreased 110 basis points year over year to 15.2% due to a combination of business mix, technology-driven operational efficiencies and the cumulative overall effects of revenue growth. These efficiency gains were partially offset by continued investments in our businesses. Our tax rate reflected early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation, adding roughly $0.06 per share in the quarter. You should expect it will add considerably less in coming quarters due to the natural pattern of equity-based compensation activity for our company.","First quarter adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share grew 17% year over year and our full-year revenue and per-share earnings outlook is strengthening, as Dave Wichmann will describe shortly. Since we know exchanges are in the minds of many of you, let me take a quick minute for an update. As you know, we have been evaluating public exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We have maintained our regular public dialog with you since November about the individual exchange market and how our own experience and performance have been unfavorable in these markets.","The smaller overall market size and shorter-term higher risk profile within this market segment continue to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis. Next year we will remain in only a handful of states, and we will not carry financial exposure from exchanges into 2017. We continue to remain an advocate for more stable and sustainable approaches to serving this market and those who rely on it for care.","With that, I will now ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's exceptional performance and then Dave to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide UnitedHealth Group comments. Larry?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman","Thanks, Steve.","Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our Investor Conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this year. We continue to estimate Optum will contribute 42% or more of enterprise-wide operating earnings this year, even considering our ongoing investments to support the future growth of this young business.","Optum's performance reflects the large-scale opportunities we are pursuing and the tremendous efforts our 100,000 employees make to deliver differentiated services and capabilities to those seeking to solve complex challenges across the healthcare system.","Our first quarter revenues of $19.7 billion grew 54% year over year or 11% prior to acquisitions. OptumRx revenues grew 72% to $14.3 billion, while OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to $5.7 billion, which is growth of 21% over the first quarter of 2015.","Our first quarter operating margin of 5.6% includes the continuing increase of pharmacy care revenues as you have seen in the past two quarters. Overall, Optum produced $1.1 billion in earnings from operations. As you may know, we identified five drivers for Optum's growth over the next five years. They are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services, and international. Last quarter we spent some time on a more detailed review of care delivery. Today we will focus on pharmacy care services then follow up briefly with data analytics.","Pharmacy care services is a high priority area for us. This focus goes back from 5 years to the original decision to undertake the largest and arguably most complex business in-sourcing ever attempted. It required significant investments, precise execution and flawless delivery.","As you know now, it has been a real success. Last year we took another step, our combination with Catamaran led by Mark Thierer who now heads our entire OptumRx platform and serves as a senior member of our overall Optum leadership team. This combination was a significant advance of scale and today the business is running at over 1 billion scripts annually up from 350 million in 2012. Eight months in, the greatly expanded OptumRx is advancing a meaningful differentiated solution for clients in the marketplace with distinctive capabilities around patient centered data analytics, new capabilities in specialty pharma such as home infusion and workplace related resources.","Since we came together our retention rates have persisted in the high 90%s and we are building our largest ever pipeline of opportunities. We were pleased this quarter to announce an innovative partnership with Walgreens to which we are creating a 90 day at retail pharmacy offering. This is all about meeting consumers where and when they want whether that means home delivery or walking into the local Walgreens store. Together, will provide choice and cost savings to our clients as we work and benefit together in a meaningful more collaborative way.","We are enthusiastic about the potential of the extension of our relationship with Walgreens, the largest retail pharmacy in the U.S. Overall, this year we expect OptumRx to generate more than $58 billion in revenues and manage nearly $80 billion in pharmacy spend for our customers including $30 billion in specialty drug spending.","Pharmaceutical spending comprises 12% to 15% of the overall cost of health benefits and has been the traditional focus of the pharmacy benefits industry. We find that focus much too limiting when it comes to improving health and healthcare overall. The impact OptumRx has on healthcare and its cost has the potential to be profoundly broader and deeper. Here you have the most frequent consumer touch point in all of healthcare, one that provides great visibility into the full healthcare continuum. An individual's engagement with OptumRx becomes more impactful when we break out of the one-dimensional procurement and formulary arbitrage model of today and open up providing consumers integrated medical and pharmaceutical services. In the process, we help reduce unnecessary overall systems utilization including ER visits, hospital admissions and readmissions and provide more effective and timely interventions to improve adherence and health outcomes.","That's the value proposition of the future we are focused on. Employers using our integrated and technology enabled approach can save in excess of $120 per member per year across their combined medical benefit.","In summary, our objective for the impact of this business goes far beyond traditional pharmaceutical management to where the potential to influence both the consumer and the health system for the better is much greater. That is why pharmacy care services are core to our growth and value story over the next decade. Optum also is delivering differentiated value from our work inside the health systems.","Our second core to our growth are unrivaled existing capabilities in healthcare data science and analytics. Companies new to the space are excited about the potential that someday these forces will vault healthcare into a new age. For Optum's customers, that someday is today. We are meeting their critical needs right now. We are the leader in using advanced technology and predictive analytics to connect stakeholders across the care continuum with the insights to better manage the health of populations and the resources they depend on.","Our continuously updated, integrated and curated clinical and claims data asset comprises more than 80 million lives of robust clinical data and 170 million lives of claims data. We can see from both sides. Beyond the 250 million clinical and administrative lives, our diverse and comprehensive data set includes 8 billion lab results, 4 billion determinations and 3 billion medical procedures. We can provide a real-time clinical and financial picture that is fully integrated and spans years of longitudinal detail.","Our health data resources continued to grow securely and responsibly every day. Today, our analytics products are helping thousands of care providers. And ultimately, the millions of consumers they serve translate data into action and action into better medical outcomes. Today, not someday, we help our customers step up from reacting to challenges to designing and implementing actions that reliably lead to better health delivered at lower cost.","Today, we are delivering the wealth of information, analysis, and positive benefits of big data with results that include double-digit improvements in critical performance factors like utilization and chronic disease control, which in turn empower care providers to adopt and succeed in new models of care and related new revenue streams.","Today, we lead the way in implementing predictive analytics in healthcare because healthcare is all that we do. Healthcare technology and data analytics have been our specialized focus for years. So while others learn to crunch large amounts of static data, Optum is fully integrated into the live flow of healthcare transactions, enabling us to provide up-to-date useful information that makes the healthcare system more intelligent and enables it to act that way.","Now, let me turn it over to Dave.","David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Larry.","As we open 2016, UnitedHealthcare's momentum continues. Strong new customer growth and historically high retention levels reflect the competitive value UnitedHealthcare offers in the marketplace. Quarter by quarter and year by year, we continue to gain new customers and retain valuable established customers who choose the combination of our more engaging consumer experience, distinctive service, product innovation, and integrated clinical and network value.","People using our modern consumer-based benefit designs are supported by actionable information available at their fingertips, enabled and delivered by advanced analytic capabilities, as Larry just described, increasingly channeled through consumer and care provider-friendly mobile technologies.","Employers continue to be drawn to well-managed competitive cost trends, physician and consumer engagement, and value-based arrangements for care delivery. We partner with our largest customers to benchmark performance and design customized plans that help them advance year by year along the continuum of ever-improving benefit performance and heightened consumer engagement. And we are serving individual patients and overall populations with more complex medical conditions.","Our coordination of services and ability to close gaps in care significantly increase the value we bring to consumers and customers. Simply put, the greater the level of patient needs, the more we can help. As a result, we continue to deliver exceptional organic growth. Our U.S.-based benefits businesses grew organically to serve 1.3 million more people with medical benefits in the first quarter, and that brought organic growth to 2 million people in the past year.","Looking at commercial markets, we are up about 700,000 people in the quarter and 1 million people since March 2015. First quarter 2016 delivered diversified growth across self-funded national accounts, public sector, small groups, middle-market businesses, and individuals.","Turning to exchanges, as we expected when we spoke with you in January, we grew roughly 300,000 lives through the first quarter and served 795,000 people on public exchanges as of March 31. We expect that level to decline to around 650,000 by December. Through this first quarter, we have seen no change in our estimates of cost from the 2015 exchange period. This quarter, with the majority of our 2016 exchange members new to us, we have been appropriately cautious in our reserve estimates, reflecting an additional $125 million in full-year 2016 exchange losses. These were fully absorbed in this quarter and fully considered for the year in our guidance range. And as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate financial exposure to exchanges in 2017.","In Medicare, the value of our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to resonate, differentiated by the stability of our benefits, networks, membership, and distribution systems. We offer seniors clear value and a consistent modern consumer experience, all of which drive new growth as well as strong consumer retention. This strength is reflected in our first quarter membership growth of about 300,000 seniors.","Medicare is a consumer business, with seniors receiving a variety of outreach approaches focused on better and more consistent care, such as receiving home visits, and benefiting from our personalized, compassionate, and education-focused consumer service. In 2015, we helped close 9 million gaps in care for seniors we serve. And we expect nearly 65% of our members to be in a four-star plan by 2017, with further improvement in that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more.","We believe our Medicare prescription drug benefit business will be much better positioned for 2017. We've pulled back in a number of markets this year to reposition products and added membership and the new product potential via a modest acquisition in the first quarter. Our Part D membership decreased 70,000 people in the first quarter and should decline by another 200,000 or so by year-end. This suggests we will serve 4.7 million to 4.8 million people by year-end 2016, considerably better than what we projected last December. And we expect to return to growth in Medicare Part D in 2017.","Switching to Medicaid, managed care serves as the most effective proven tool to ensure budget sustainability for state Medicaid programs. This financial predictability along with the ability of managed care to expedite systems transformation, comprehensively integrating care while addressing social determinants, has resulted in an unprecedented level of procurement activity. Of special note is the significant increase in the volume of opportunities for populations with more complex needs, such as people served by long-term services and support programs.","The recent award of Nebraska's integrated health, behavioral, and pharmaceutical model reinforces these expected trends in procurement to include more populations with more complex needs and to look to integrated solution to address state's needs. Our expectation for continued expansion of opportunities to serve all Medicaid populations was reinforced by our recent award in two California counties and across our community and state business the addition of 145,000 people in the first quarter.","Let me now touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Building on the strength of our first quarter, we expect full year revenues of approximately $182 billion, up from our prior outlook of $180 billion to $181 billion led by strength in OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual.","Strong first quarter results combined with a slightly lower tax rate for the balance of the year and the impact of recently completed acquisitions allows us to increase our outlook for adjusted net earnings by $0.15 to a range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We continue to foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion.","As you know, we expect Optum to grow full year operating earnings by more than 30% in 2016. We continue to expect seasonality to be a factor in our overall earnings results. Similar to years past Optum expects to generate in the area of 60% of its operating earnings in the second half of the year while the current consensus view appears to be modestly more first-half biased.","Taken together, this suggests that updates for full year UnitedHealth Group earnings per share estimates after recognition of our first quarter performance would most appropriately be focused on the second half of this year.","Turning to capital, we closed the quarter with a strong balance sheet. We expect share repurchase activity to be more pronounced in the first half of this year with the second half focused on debt reduction toward targeted levels and we will see our dividend levels \u2013 we will address our dividend levels at our June board meeting as we do each year.","Steve?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Dave.","Today we are in a strong position at a unique moment in time. We have the opportunity to considerably elevate our performance around quality and customer satisfaction, delivering greater value and driving unparalleled organic growth across our entire franchise. While remaining as always disciplined on pricing and cost management.","We are focused on delivering higher quality at every touch point with every customer and consumer, doing this well elevates customer trust and loyalty, loyalty that becomes the foundation for an extended period of growth benefiting consumers, society and shareholders. We're intensely focused on this agenda and expect it will produce strong clean results in 2016 and a positive view of opportunities in 2017 and the decade to come.","So thank you for your interest today. And operator, could we please open for questions, again one per analyst please this morning. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we can take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question, nice quarter. Can you explain to me a little more about what's going on with the individual exchange business? You've given us a lot of information, but it sounded like you said $125 million added to reserves, so that would be like $0.08 of earnings pressure this quarter, and I think you talked about only $0.15 of earnings pressure for the whole year previously. So I'm trying to understand whether that was all earnings pressure this quarter or was that coming out of the PDR? What's the PDR value today on the balance sheet, maybe would help.","And finally, how does the withdrawals at the various state levels impact what you're doing with Harken Health?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me go with the \u2013 so I'll have Dan respond to the first part of this, I'll just indicate that Harken is a small and interesting innovation that we are considering and we will stay with it, again it's in a very modest pilot position. So it really doesn't affect our review of this in terms of the way we're thinking about our positioning on exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We will be down to, again, a handful of states that we will be actively participating in the exchange. Dan, why don't you just give them the overall baseline in terms of the exchange P&L outlook?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Peter.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","So let me \u2013 why don't I recap what we shared with you in our prior conversations and then talk specifically about what we're updating today. So in January we described an expected combined loss for both the 2015 and 2016 policy years of $1 billion. Inside that, the 2015 policy year loss was $475 million, and that number, as Dave mentioned, remains unchanged. Obviously, the balance related to the 2016 policy year, so at that point was estimated at $525 million. Today we are updating our full year outlook for the 2016 policy year to a loss of $650 million. So that $125 million increase was fully recognized in our first quarter financials and not surprisingly our PDR, as you asked, did increase over the course of the first quarter.","As we look at it, our enrollment is very much in keeping with our expectation at that 795,000 lives on the exchange specifically, and I'll tell you that well over half of that enrollment is new to us this year. So as we look at it, the early indications on the health status of the members appears to be a little bit worse, so we are being appropriately cautious in updating our full year outlook and recognizing that additional $125 million in the first quarter financial results.","In the month of June, importantly, we will have a first indication of how our risk scores actually compare to the industry and we will look forward to updating you further at that time with regard to our individual ACA business. Thank you.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's really helpful. And then how much is the PDR value exactly now?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","It's bigger.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","What we're trying to convey is that we added $125 million to the quarter and added for the full year. So the PDR has increased. We weren't going to get into the exact amount of the PDR in this morning's. Maybe we can take that off line through the course of the day.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. I was hoping you could help us understand the prior year reserve development figure, how that breaks out? It's obviously a lot larger than what you had a year ago. How do we think about that benefiting or not benefiting the first quarter earnings? And if you can just give us any detail on where that came from?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Dave, you want to handle that?","David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thank you, Matt, for the question. The prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2016 advanced explicitly by about $220 million or so, and that on a comparative quarter basis. That influenced our MLR favorably in the quarter as well as our EPS as well. The development, although I won't get into the specifics of how that's broken out by line of business, it was pretty broad reaching across all of our lines of business, and really is reflective of what we experienced in the fourth quarter as well, which is the delayed realization of affordability efforts and end market initiatives that we pursued in UnitedHealthcare in the back half of 2015. So we're very pleased with how our trends are developing consistent with the forecast that we provided you before and obviously this is a favorable development in the quarter.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And last year's first quarter was actually unusually low. Dan, do you have anything else to respond?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","No, the only thing I'd highlight is just add a little bit more color on some of the things that are contributing. As we look at trying to drive greater value for customers and consumers that we serve, some of the areas not surprisingly we've talked to you about at length in the past, our focus on inpatient management is ever present, 2015 marked our seventh consecutive year of absolute reductions in both admissions and bed days on a per capita basis and that's true across all of our lines of business. But we also extend that work into other areas with particular focus around outpatient because it's one of the bigger drivers of cost and making sure that we're driving care to the most appropriate setting and likewise looking at out-of-network spend. So there's some context, Matt, on some of the things that we're looking at. And as you look at the contribution to the quarter, I would tell you the change in the development, the majority of that, was P&L impacting to your question.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think if you look over...","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","If you look over the last four years you'd say this quarter was more normal and that last year would be more of a low outlier. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Larry, you're very good at boiling things down to bullet point lists. I wondered if, in this data analytics conversation, you could talk about the audiences that are consuming your technology in data analytics and I'm interested in the breadth there, and perhaps where you see the most significant untapped opportunity for monetizing the data and analytics?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman","Do you want me to take it?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman","Dave, it's Larry Renfro. I'm going to ask Bill Miller to comment on this and he'll take you through into some of the specifics of areas that we are talking to and people we are talking to. But in general, across the \u2013 nationally, obviously, we are working with everybody on the provider side as well as we are also working with our own programs internally at UHC. So we've got a good start in terms of how we're using the data, the analytics. it's a key, key component in terms of how we're headed for the future. Bill?","Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight","Yeah, I'd say just to follow-up \u2013 and I appreciate the question, Dave. If you look at our history, we've got decades of experience really using analytics as a foundational tool to build a lot of businesses. And when you ask about constituencies that we serve, it ranges, as Larry mentioned, from providers, payers where we're particularly strong, but also government, pharma who we've been servicing for a long time, and now more recently, consumers and employers.","Just to give you a flavor for some ways that they're consuming these analytics, I mean, from a payer and provider standpoint, people have been using our analytics to close gaps in care on a monthly basis. We fire off 131 billion rule-based decisions every month to help close gaps using our tool like Optum One, which you've heard a lot about. It's really crunching and assessing both clinical and claims data to predict where we're going to see people that need interventions, and those interventions are additive to the tool and how we've extended it in terms of being able to action it where we can actually go out and prove where we've shown how our interventions intercede in people having strokes, people having heart attacks, and what that saves not obviously is good for the patient, but obviously good for the system. Our revenue cycle analytics actively are taking out friction between payers and providers, speeding up payment, driving more accuracy and improving the financial conditions of both payers and providers.","So I could go on and provide a lot examples, but they range from strong financial performance that our analytics drive to clinical performance which really drive better outcomes and lower costs.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So if I could summarize, all the markets you would expect. Payer, provider, employer, state, Federal, anybody who sponsors a broad program, domestic, U.S., international and life sciences. And I'd say we are kind of in the second or third generation in terms of tools, tools that could be effective, and I'd parse them into two areas: kind of those that really affect clinical encounters and outcomes so they're kind of more in the Optum Care domain, where you can really drive performance; and then those that are broader system-wide, which might be more in the Optum360 domain.","And then the other thing I'd say is that we're in the early stages because the process of those who are interested in these analytics are really just getting going and being able to use them at their full value in terms of the real-time speed they operate at, et cetera, because they're used to things that are much slower, agreed?","Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight","Agreed, and I think that's where we've seen a lot of the uptake, Dave. As reform has hit, it's the need for speed, the need for action, the need for having tools that actually allow you to take, affect, and move the needle with respect to cost, quality, and outcomes is critical in how they integrate with other systems.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Whether they're at a consumer level or whether they're at a system-wide level.","Bill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight","Right.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so that's why I think we're in the early stages but have such a well-established base in this, so I would think that there will be continued evolution and growth to come from this.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Very good, thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you for the question. Can you speak to some of the one-time pressures on MLR? So how much was the leap year impact? With the PDR, would there be any pressure on MLR from exchanges that may fall off next year? And how did the four cost buckets end up versus your expectations?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Dan, do you want to touch on that?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Good morning, Sarah.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","So as you look at the consolidated care ratio, so we reported 81.7% in the quarter this year, and that compared to last year, it's about 30 basis points increase year over year. As you look inside that, the biggest factor driving the increase was the additional calendar day, and second would be then the exchange impact, and that being partially offset by the change in reported development on a year-over-year basis. I think the last part of your question was on cost categories. Is that what you said, Sarah?","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yes, the four cost buckets, inpatient, outpatient, Rx, physician, how do they trend versus expectations?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Good. So as we looked at our medical costs in the quarter, they were \u2013 we had expected coming into the year a moderate increase in the trend, the underlying utilization trend, and I'll tell you in the first quarter we were able to manage to that outcome and so very consistent with it. On a category basis, I would tell you that I wouldn't spike out any change relative to the guidance that we provided at the investor conference back in December. And we continue to expect on the full year a commercial cost trend in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And you're seeing pressure in the usual places, outpatient, specialty?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Yes.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Testing?","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Yes.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So nothing really changed.","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","No, very consistent with what we described in December.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us some indicators on how the risk mix is looking on the new Medicare Advantage lives. It looks like United has added around \u2013 accounted for around 65% of the growth in the MA market. So I'm just interested in terms of as you track that, if you can give us some details on how risk scores are looking on the new MA lives. And then in terms of the mix of those members that are coming from competitor share gains as compared to attracting them from fee-for-service? Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steve Nelson?","Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer","Sure, thanks. Good morning, Scott. We're really pleased with the growth that we saw in both the open enrollment period, but also in our outlook for SEP, the special election period. And this growth is a result of the hard work we've been talking to you about over the past two or three years around \u2013 and putting ourselves in a position to offer stable benefits. But the work around improving our stars, engaging our network differently and aligning incentives, really good engagement with our distribution system, and then innovations in our member experience have all led to not only strong sales, but it's important to note, strong retention as well. So the vast majority of our membership is retained membership, membership that we have great experience with.","But in terms of the mix across \u2013 and the different categories that I would think about in describing our mix is around geography, which is very broad-based. The growth came pretty evenly across our geography, so that was very much in line with our expectations. Our new to Medicare population, we're seeing actually that population choose Medicare Advantage more often, the percentages growing there, and we see that sequentially. That's our experience, but that again is very much in line with our expectation.","And then the new-to-us category, which folks that have just enrolled in other plans and enrolled in one of our plans again is very much in line with our expectations. So we're seeing a really strong performance in this business over the first quarter, and we expect to build on that. And our outlook for growth in 2017 is really strong in both \u2013 I should mention in both the individual and the group retiree segment as well, as we're seeing a really strong pipeline there.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So really what I'd say is in three dimensions, well dispersed geographically, well mixed between new to Medicare and new to us, and then a good mix between individual and group, so stable group.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. So it sounds like broad-based pretty much across all the channels is the bottom line.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think the point you made about how well dispersed we are geographically is key, so good question. Next, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, thank you. You mentioned that international is one of your five major pillars. Could you speak to where you expect to see the growth, where you're seeing the opportunities in international? And how is Brazil doing?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. They actually, I think, are two different categories, so I'll ask Larry to touch on international because I think when we talked about it in the context of growth it was more on the Optum side. And then Dave can touch on Brazil.","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman","So, Christine, it's Larry. I think we sized back at the investor conference in December, we sized that market as being about a $500 billion business. This is a marathon, it's not a sprint. We are getting established. We have actually been in the UK for about 10 years. But what we're really engaging in today is much broader. It's down the lines of integrated care. We're working with the trust, and in the UK the trust would be the hospitals. We're working with what's called NHS Improvement. They're the organization that really monitors the trust. We're working with NHS. We're working with the Prime Minister's office, the Department of Health. So we have a variety of programs that we have underway, and we believe that we're pretty well-positioned at this point to bring a lot of the products and services that we actually have in the States. I didn't want to interrupt the conversation a few minutes ago about the data and the analytics, but that also is a very, very good area for us to introduce, and we're working to do just that as we speak today. Dave?","David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Christine. It's Dave Wichmann. So just specifically a few comments on Amil and the activities we've undertaken. The business remains profitable as it was last year. Similar to last year, it's continued to become more and more competitive in the market and I'd say the market segments that are the most attractive in Brazil. And the performance improvement across the business has been substantial. We have put in very strong pricing and cost containment disciplines. We've improved our service substantially down there, I'd say, to more of a kind of a UnitedHealthcare-style service approach, but in Brazil. Our Net Promoter Scores in the market continue to advance, and we have a more extensive and better performing healthcare delivery company broadly, so I'd characterize that all as a stronger foundation.","Obviously, we're still impacted by the devaluation of the real. That affects both our revenues and then you can see it there probably best, where in local currency, we have a 16% increase in our revenues, but when you translate into the U.S. dollars, it's a 15% decrease. And I think it's obvious that the economy is not particularly strong there, companies are struggling, middle class is flat to declining slightly, and obviously the political situation is unsettled. It certainly doesn't help things a whole lot. So we are pretty measured in terms of our view about Brazil right at this point in time.","We are competitive, like I said, in certain segments and we are focused on our growth in those segments, and we are growing. We do have a fair amount of in-group attrition right now as employment levels decline on a \u2013 at an employer-by-employer basis, but we are seeing growth underneath all of that, which is very encouraging.","I think most important, really, as it relates to Amil is that we've \u2013 not only are we a strong insurance company, but we've created a strong healthcare delivery company throughout the course of the time that we've owned Amil and we see that as very positive positioning in that market and a meaningful source of our overall performance advance expectations here in 2016.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So profitable despite the economic stress, not particularly helpful political environment, but continuing to actually fare well and growing as a \u2013 in terms of its dimension as a delivery system, which I think is distinctive in that market. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Wright with Sterne Agee CRT.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks for the question, good morning. The last time I think you all updated the market sizing opportunity for Optum was back in 2011 at over $500 billion. Do you have any updated thoughts on what the size of the opportunity is now?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman","Sure. It's Larry. Brian, we have sized the \u2013 and I'm going to turn this over to John Rex. I'm probably going to answer the question and then he won't have anything to say, but the domestic side today, we would size at about $680 billion, and the international side at $500 billion. So you're looking at $1.180 trillion that would be the market size. I don't know, John, do you have anything?","John Franklin Rex - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Optum, Inc.","No, that's accurate. That's where would be in terms of the current view of domestic, up from the initial $0.5 trillion. And you think about that growth across, you know, at that point, we talked about eight markets. I would say that there's been growth across all those markets. I'd highlight areas really probably in such as care delivery and kind of technology is among those areas that have been growing among the faster since we last provided that. But kind of a proportionate movement in terms of the area that we spiked out a few years ago.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So next question, please.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. Maybe I'll just ask about the acquisition pipeline and the opportunities. It looks like you spent about $1.7 billion in the quarter. I know there was \u2013 I've read about the Symphonix deal. I wonder if you could comment on some of the other opportunities that you've seen and taken advantage of.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So maybe we'll talk a little bit about the M&A activity we have done. We typically don't comment on where we're going in these areas for a whole host of obvious reasons, so our comments in M&A are more retrospective than they'll be prospective.","David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer","A.J., thanks for the question. It's Dave Wichmann. So our acquisition pipeline and our acquisition activities are really focused in a couple of areas in particular. Obviously, we just got done talking about the size of the services market globally, and so we continue to invest capital to access or broaden our capabilities across Optum and then to also establish a foundational market position, so it can grow from there.","We also see interest in the \u2013 still in the international markets, although our activities there have dampened just a bit given the \u2013 how those global markets are performing overall. And of course we still have interest kind of broadly across our business. We haven't done much in the health plan space in quite some time because of all the work that we've done over the course of the last two decades to establish strong market presence as well as strong presence in each Medicare, commercial and Medicaid. But certainly we would continue to consider those things in the future.","As it relates to the first quarter, I think folks know that we funded the Helios acquisition at that time, which is a workplace health PBM, in the first quarter. We also, as we have indicated in the past, have a strong interest in continuing to develop our OptumCare business. And so there's a small acquisition inside there as well.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No real change. The same basic agenda, looking at capabilities, looking to build out the platforms. Probably on the international side there might be more opportunity in services and benefits at the time, so good question. Next, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning. So question on the tax rate and the intangibles comments you had in your prepared remarks and the press release today. What should we think about as the tax rate going forward from here for the rest of the year? And what do you think is the sustainability of the benefits into 2017?","David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer","Tom, it's Dave Wichmann again. So thanks for your question. The tax rate change is really because there was a new accounting pronouncement that came out in March, which we think has a $0.10 impact on the full year of which we recognized $0.06 in the first quarter. The pronouncement wasn't required to be adopted until 1\/1\/2017, but as is often the case, if we're prepared to adopt, we go ahead and adopt early as allowed by the pronouncement. The sustainability of that is this is going to be a little bit of a challenge, I think, broadly for companies because what it does is subjects your tax rate or your tax position to more of a period type cost or some more volatility overall in the expected effective tax rate, and in part because it has to do with the combination of the performance of your stock and then also the timing of option exercises as well as stock-based plans, either vesting and\/or becoming available to employees at given points in time.","So there will be a little more volatility in the rate. We expect the full year rate to be in the neighborhood of about 41% or so for the full year 2016. And we'd expect on that at least this impact, if you will, of the new accounting pronouncement to be pretty consistent year-after-year, depending upon, again, how the stock price performs as well as the vesting activity underlying our equity-based plans.","David Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer","But it is a year-by-year proposition and so long as you have equity-based compensation and a belief that your stock is going to continue to perform, there will be tax benefits that come through and then they'll just come through quarter-by-quarter. Right?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","These used to go through equity in the past, so they're now just going through the P&L. And one other question you might have, just to make it clear, why is it $0.06 in the first and $0.04 in the balance of the year, and it is just the timing of the way in which we issue equity in our business, which is generally in the first quarter.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks a lot. Larry, I just wondered if you could you update us on your retail care, neighborhood care model in terms of giving us a sense of what number of locations you're up to, and if the target is still kind of 25 to 30 clinics a year?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman","Sure. I'm going to ask Jack Larsen to join in this conversation. But that target, as you said, of 30, I'd say we might try to be a little more aggressive about that. If we kind of back up and we kind of look at our business and I think you're pretty much aware of this is our overall business plan, we're trying to be in 75 markets and we're balancing how we do that through acquisitions, through startups and so forth. So we are progressing on target, and our expectations are that we will continue to grow and that's one of the areas, as Dave mentioned, that we will be looking to have acquisitions in, more along the care delivery side, but from I think you're speaking more about the urgent care and what we're doing there. So let me turn it over to Jack and let him answer this question.","Jack Larsen - Executive Vice President, OptumCare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Thanks, Larry, and good morning, Michael. Yeah. I would just amplify what Larry said, we do have aspirations for rather smart growth with our standalone neighborhood care centers. I think from a consumer and retail point of view we're seeing great receptivity for the units, the kind of services we offer. And look, one of the more important determinants of overall healthcare cost is where a consumer enters the healthcare system, and we think what it is that our neighborhood care centers offer with respect to the portfolio of services and retail orientation of it, really hits the mark in a number of ways.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then just one quick question. At some point should we expect the rebranding effort to come under the Optum banner, or is that not necessary given the local dynamics that are out there?","Larry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman","We're always studying that, but what I would tell you, and I think you know this pretty well that this is all about local care delivery and being in local communities. So the brand is pretty strong in the different areas where we work. We do brand it as Powered by Optum and so forth, but those things are six of one, half a dozen of the other, so we're going to have to watch that for a period of time before we make any decision about full branding.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for the update.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for fitting me in here, guys. I want to talk about the commercial business. The membership numbers came in a little bit stronger than we were looking in the first quarter, so curious where some of those gains are coming. And then I'm really more interested in the 2017 national account selling season and what you're seeing there, how customers are reacting to the potential mergers for some of the two or four of the bigger companies out there? And maybe, are you just seeing more accounts put out RFPs, or do you think retention levels for the industry will be similar and maybe this is a 2018 event?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let's do the first one first with Dan, and then maybe Jeff can comment on the national business scene.","Daniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Josh. I appreciate the question. Certainly in the quarter we had very strong growth in our commercial business. It was well balanced across both funding status as well as geography, and then within that by line of business. As we talked at the investor conference, you can look at the fully insured result as an example. The results inside there are actually muted a little bit by a large customer in a third-party exchange that went through a funding conversion.","So if you actually adjust it for that, you'd see inside there really are strong growth in our small and middle market, and we continue to see customers responding to the value proposition that we're offering in the market. And we also see from a pricing standpoint our competition moving more in line with us. So as they orient more around a future outlook of cost that resembles something closer to reality, what we see is that we're becoming more competitive, and that market frankly favors is.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff?","Jeff Alter - Chief Executive Officer-UnitedHealthcare Employer","Sure. Good morning, Josh. It's Jeff Alter. The national account selling season is probably just cost of the cycle. It's down from the last few years. There aren't a lot of large clients out to bid. I think part of that is the industry does a lot of proactive renewals, the same as we do, to keep some of the large clients from going out to a full bid. It's early. The market is sizing up now, we're in a season of the finalist meetings. Probably by June we'll get a better sense of where we're positioned and how that market is shaping up. But it is a selling season marked with a lot of smaller cases as opposed to some of the past seasons that had some fairly large clients out to bid.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So no real impact from any of the pending mergers, is that fair?","Jeff Alter - Chief Executive Officer-UnitedHealthcare Employer","Fair now. I'll probably update you a little bit better once we get through the finalist season and some of the post-finalist discussions.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That may be more a dynamic to the next year.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's probably more a dynamic next year. So maybe we only have time for maybe two more questions. So next, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities USA.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hello, gentlemen, thank you very much. And as always, it's a pleasure to look at your earnings release. So I'm going to step back from some of the important details we've been discussing and focus on the question of how UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare are integrating, which is always one of my focus areas. But in particular, my concern is that the cost out of pocket is very significant for the consumer. If you go on the exchanges and you try to price an individual policy, it can cost you $38,000 without subsidies. Similarly, if you're insured by an employer, your out-of-pocket costs rise every year, yet Optum is clearly influencing through tying its analytics and services to the actual provision of care and changing that process. Optum is clearly influencing United; it's clearly influencing the market. When or how can United take a leadership role to revolutionize or take that next step to revolutionize the benefit and cost structure so that we consumers can actually see it in our pockets and United can gain share and then really dominate the market?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is quite a question, and I admire the direction of it. But maybe I could only respond to it in the broadest context.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","That would be great, thank you.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","If I were to take some of the national account clients that we're privileged to serve and who have been more progressive adopters of the entire breadth of capabilities that we can bring to them and then working with them cooperatively and then working with them in terms of how they are engaging their consumers, if you will, you actually see distinctive performance patterns. And you see them distinctive in terms of, I'd say, two dimensions, better use of the healthcare resource system, resources in total, and a year-by-year improvement in the consistency of that pattern of usage, and improvement in their overall health status as they embrace with and get comfortable with programs that are more consumer-friendly and easier and, as you suggest, fueled with data analytics that are now really positioned that they can actually act on them and the whole spectrum of what we have been talking about that some of the things that we are doing and capabilities we're putting in the marketplace on a real-time basis.","The marketplace is adjusting in terms of how do I exactly use these. They know directionally how they want to use them. I don't know if they are nuts and bolts to quite that point, but these more progressive clients have had distinctively better cost positions and distinctively better patterns of consumer decisions, resource utilization, and health status, wellness.","If we can translate that from those venues to the more progressive \u2013 to make them more progressive in other sectors of the marketplace, and I think about the large government sectors because they have the same attributes as large health employer sponsors. They are sponsoring large populations. They have more influence on how these programs go. Then you begin to get into the water with respect to consumer behavior and you get into the water with respect to care provider behavior. And those kinds of developments I think can really establish these patterned measures, can really drive change.","And clients are seeing it, states are seeing it, governments are seeing it. Some of Larry's commentary with respect to international is showing some of these patterns to international governments that have arguably a different healthcare system. And their response to these things and then the whole idea that the technology is now capable of doing this at such scale and such speed and doing it down to a mobile expression, whoever uses that mobile expression, whether it's a care provider or a consumer, those things are playing out.","So we are in the early stages, the best way to see it is in the large national accounts. And then, believe it or not, you can see it in some of the things like Medicaid, where you can see large state sponsors that once they really get these programs in a mature state, are driving distinctive results relative to the populations they're serving.","The next stage is really getting this directly to the consumer. And I think there, platforms like Rally really represent the first generation of a way to actually jump over and really get in the consumers' head using these applications and things like that. And I think this is just the beginning. So that would be my reaction to it. I don't know if we can react in a more granular way. So I thank you for that question and next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes, thanks. I appreciate you fitting me in. On the Medicare rate, could you give us your thoughts for 2017? Any reactions to the 0.85% post the fixing of the error, the risk coding changes, and the impact on your partial and full dual mix of business, the employer group waiver plan?","And then on the HIF, the tax holiday, do you see that flowing through to seniors and accelerating industry growth? And how does that all impact your book of business for 2017? Is it about a top line or margin expansion?","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think we're going to get into \u2013 we typically don't get into the nuts and bolts of the Medicare rate. We would again kind of express disappointment that the funding patterns that Medicare has been using for Medicare Advantage seems to under-fund a program that is so well embraced by seniors and so effective at serving them. So we continue to advocate for more consistent and more market-oriented funding for that. So, Steve, I'll \u2013 beyond that comment, offer your response to that and then the \u2013 her second question.","Steven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Good morning, Ana. It's Steve Nelson. I'll just make a couple comments to add to Steve's there, beyond the rates, a little color around insurer's fee and the changes to the group benefits. With respect to insurer's fee, to step back a little bit, our goal is to provide predictable and stable benefits to seniors. It's something that we were able to do this year and that's I think going to be important over the long run. So as you know, we're in the midst of benefit planning right now and that is going to be one factor that we consider amongst several other factors in our pursuit of this goal to offer stable benefits in what, as Steve accurately described it, remains an under-funded environment in 2017. So it will be something that we'll consider and be able to talk more about after we get through our planning season.","In terms of the group, change to the group benefit, while we're disappointed in that change, it remains \u2013 I would just say the value to the retirees and employers who are trying to find solutions for the retiree population. Medicare Advantage remains a very strong value proposition, and we're seeing that actually play out in our pipeline development and as we look towards 2017 as one of the strongest in years. So there's a lot of work for us to do in terms of continuing to advocate for seniors on behalf of this very popular and effective program, and we're going to continue to do that. Thanks for the question.","Stephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So that's the end of our questions. So just in closing, I offer that we have a unique opportunity to serve more people in more meaningful ways in distinguished UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare through the quality of our work. And as we elevate our focus on quality service to consumers and customers, we expect broad-based growth to follow. So we thank you, and that concludes our call this morning. Thank you very much for attending.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"21299":["UnitedHealth Group Inc.

I will be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information.","This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the Company\u2019s Investors page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 17, 2017, which maybe accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the company\u2019s website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead, sir.","David Wichmann","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. This quarter, we are pleased to report continued broad-based growth and forward momentum for our diverse healthcare enterprise. In our sessions with you each quarter, it is both humbling and an honor particularly from this chair to represent the dedication, energy and work of the 260,000 women and men who comprised this company today. I have the privilege of witnessing their efforts up close as I work with our people across the globe and it is inspiring. Each day, our people leverage clinical insights, data and information, advanced technologies and a service minded culture to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. Having the opportunity to live this mission and witness its impact drives all of us.","Over the past few decades, we have evolved as we have grown to serve more people and expanded our capabilities, but to us it often feels like we are just getting started. We see more opportunities to serve and to grow further in the next 10 years than ever before. We are focused on diversifying our business applying analytics and advanced technology to improve the use of information and better engage people and to improve the effectiveness of our businesses and ultimately the broad health system. We are raising our quality through rigorous net promoter disciplines leading to greater trust and loyalty. We are reducing healthcare costs to make healthcare more affordable advancing market leading innovations and simplifying the healthcare experience for consumers and care providers. The pace of growth of our organization that is achieved will be determined by how well we work with, perform for and serve others. The more we effectively serve the healthcare market\u2019s true needs, the more we will realize our full potential leading to predictable and consistent growth in revenues, earnings, cash flows and enterprise value.","To that end, this morning we reported strong performance in the third quarter of 2017. We grew revenues by 9% to $50.3 billion and grew adjusted earnings by 23% to $2.66 per share. And we reported $7.5 billion in cash flows from operations and annualized return on shareholders\u2019 equity of 22.5% and a debt to total capital ratio of 38.2%, down nearly 900 basis points over last year. We now expect full year 2017 adjusted earnings to approach $10 per share. We expect this strong business momentum and performance to continue into 2018, 2019 and beyond driven by growth and service to our customers. In light, we will walk you through recent business trends in more detail beginning with Larry Renfro, our UnitedHealth Group Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Optum.","Larry Renfro","Thank you, Dave. Optum\u2019s third quarter included continued growth, strong margin than earnings and further strategic advantage. Third quarter revenues grew nearly $2 billion to approach $23 billion, an 8.4% advance over last year. Optum\u2019s earnings from operations of $1.7 billion were again well-balanced with each segment producing double-digit percentage growth in operating earnings. A nearly 16% increase in Optum\u2019s earnings was driven by the combination of strong revenue growth, business expansion and strengthened operating margins for both OptumHealth and OptumRx and a steady 20% operating margin at OptumInsight. Overall, Optum\u2019s operating margin of 7.4% increased 70 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. OptumHealth grew revenues over 21% year-over-year as it expanded to serve approximately 9 million more consumers over the past year. OptumHealth has among the broadest reaches in healthcare directly serving 90 million consumers.","Per capita revenue growth was again strong in the third quarter rising more than 9% versus last year as earnings from operations increased 27%. OptumHealth is supporting the U.S. Departments of Defense and Veteran Affairs by providing healthcare services and expertise. Earlier this year, the Defense Health Agency awarded Optum a 5-year agreement to support Military Health System\u2019s global advice service. Beginning in March 2018, our registered nursing staff will provide triage services, self-care advice, care coordination and general health advice to active members of military and their families, 24\/7 via secure phone videoconference or web chat.","In August, the Advisory Board and OptumInsight agreed to merge in a transaction we expect to close by the end of 2017. The Advisory Board has long been a distinctive leading provider of research, consulting and technology serving about 4,000 hospitals and health systems across the nation. We believe their outstanding team of independent healthcare experts can extend their work into payer services, life sciences and other healthcare arenas leveraging Optum\u2019s data analytics capabilities and the breadth of Optum\u2019s product offerings for our combined client base. We look forward to their team led by their Chief Executive, Robert Musslewhite joining OptumInsight.","We were pleased this quarter to receive a multiyear award to serve the Triple-S Blue Cross Blue Shield Puerto Rico Health Plan managing its administrative and operational infrastructure. We expect our technology and capabilities in core operations. Transaction processing and connectivity will help Triple-S achieve its quality, satisfaction and cost ambitions. OptumInsight\u2019s revenue backlog has grown more than $1 billion so far this year reaching nearly $14 billion at third quarter\u2019s end. And earnings from operations grew 11.6% over last year\u2019s third quarter. At OptumRx, we fulfilled over 320 million adjusted scripts in the third quarter, growth of 12 million scripts over last year and consistent with our above market growth rate in 2017.","Earnings from operations grew 11.3% over last year while revenues grew 4.7%. As we delivered substantial value and supply chain economics to our customers, OptumRx has positioned itself to compete as a market leader. We served the generic brands and specialty pharmacy needs of consumers in retail, mail and home infused delivery models. We have high customer retention and we have been awarded meaningful new pharmacy care service contracts, including the State of New Jersey beginning this January as well as a leading state Medicaid program beginning mid 2018 and ramping up to the course of the year. These complement growth from our health plan partners and from medium-sized and large employers in the commercial carve-out pharmacy market. We have strong momentum in specialty pharmacy, but we expect full year 2017 revenues to increase 20% over last year and growth momentum to continue into 2018.","Our synchronized data driven approach to specialty pharmacy integrates pharmacy and medical engagement. We then drive customer satisfaction by delivering strong service and personalizing the patient\u2019s experience across the breadth of information channels they choose to use. Through these and other ways, Optum brings insights to help make health systems perform better. We recently formalized the way we present our distinctive data and analytics capabilities under the Optum IQ brand. The Optum IQ name sharpens our narrative by capturing the rich data and deep distinctive analytic capabilities embedded in the products and services we delivered to customers. Overall, at Optum, we remain relentless in pursuing organic growth, strong execution raising NPS, innovating and feeding and growing relationship.","Now, let me turn it over to Steve Nelson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. Steve?","Steve Nelson","Thank you, Larry. Like the Optum team, UnitedHealthcare is pleased to report strong performance across the business this quarter. At UnitedHealthcare, we continue to focus on a few critical priorities. The first is quality, which includes both clinical quality and the experience consumers and care providers have with us. We are gratified to see our NPS core is advancing with consumers and clients across our product lines and with providers. Next is our relentless focus on managing costs. As customers expect us to be good stewards of their financial resources, one example, 2017 is tracking to be the ninth consecutive year UnitedHealthcare\u2019s customers will experience fewer, inpatient hospital admissions per 1,000 people.","Third is our partnership with Optum. We are further leveraging capabilities to improve performance and innovate for our customers and care providers, nowhere does our clinical engagement performed better than where it combines with the clinical delivery capabilities of OptumCare\u2019s local market ambulatory care practices. Consumers regularly give OptumCare practices NPS scores in the 70 to 90 range and for 2018, 100% of OptumCare Medicare Advantage patients will be in plans rated four stars or higher. Together, we are able to better serve the clinical needs of UnitedHealthcare patients with the higher quality, lower cost and improved customer experience. In turn, we strengthened Optum\u2019s practices through market leading growth, innovation and clinical insights all aimed at better serving people one at a time everyday.","The fourth priority is what we refer to internally is distinction. It is how we describe the truly compelling experience we are creating for people across a variety of dimensions. This includes creating distinctive relationships with care delivery system partners and driving simplicity for consumers. On Rally, our consumer digital platform we added additional private health insurance plan selection capabilities this past quarter to help pick the best benefit plan for their needs taking into account their age, family status, health background and economics.","Doing these things well leads to the final priority, I will discuss today, growth, where our innovative commercial benefits have grown with remarkable consistency and we have considerable long-term opportunities for substantial growth in the public and senior sectors. Nationally, there are about 85 million people representing 1 trillion in annual spending who do not benefit from managed care offerings. The majority of these people are served by unmanaged higher cost fee-for-service programs operated by federal and state authorities. These people will benefit from the insights and the progressive tools that effectively support coordinated patient treatment across all access points in the healthcare system. Seniors and Medicaid beneficiaries served through our more progressive care models see higher quality care, lower costs and improve value. We expect the growth for years to come as the market continues its steady shift from costly outdated programs to innovative approaches like those offered by UnitedHealthcare.","In Medicare, our revenues of $16.3 billion grew more than 17% over last year. Over the past year, we added nearly 1 million people, 100,000 of them in just the last 3 months split evenly between Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement. We expect more Medicare growth in 2018 based on both the growing MA market and our unique value proposition, which offer stable products, a simple and personal experience and a distinctive culture. In 2018, our quality Star scores advance again. Approximately 85% of the seniors we serve will be enrolled in plans rated four stars or higher. The initial stars data for 2019 payment year once again show strong organic improvement, because our underlying plans are performing consistently at higher levels. We expect our final star ratings in 2019 payment year to approximate or exceed the high performing levels of 2018 supporting benefit value and better health outcomes for the seniors we serve and growth for our business in this important market.","In community and state, third quarter revenues grew 12.8% over last year. Third quarter membership levels remain stable representing a year-over-year advance of nearly 600,000 people with the continuing favorable mix shift toward more complex health conditions and higher acuity programs, which is our strength. During the quarter, we went live with programs in Virginia and in October, the First Californians joined UnitedHealthcare under new Medi-Cal contracts in two counties. In addition, we are excited by our active pipeline of renewal and new business opportunities as states expand and diversify the populations they serve through managed Medicaid.","Turning to UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, our commercial group full risk offering sustained momentum in a consistently competitive environment growing to serve 40,000 more people this quarter more than 0.5 million in the past 12 months and 1.1 million over the past 3 years. These results reflect improved experiences for consumers and predictable cost trend management for employers driven by a combination of innovative benefit designs and locally payer networks, all of which lead to rising retention and strong new business generation. We recently decided to enter the Northern Plain\u2019s health insurance markets, including Minnesota beginning in the second half of 2018. Our team in Minnesota is looking forward to serving our neighbors more fully in coming years. Taken as a whole, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues this quarter by $3.6 billion to $40.7 billion nearly 10% growth and earnings from operations of $2.4 billion in the quarter grew over 13% year-over-year.","Now, I will turn the call over to John Rex for a financial review.","John Rex","Thank you, Steve. Across UnitedHealth Group in the third quarter, we delivered strong, well-balanced performance, with most principal businesses again posting revenue growth rate, up 10% or higher. Consolidated revenues of $50.3 billion for the quarter grew 8.7% over last year despite the ACA effects at UnitedHealthcare. Our consolidated earnings from operations exceeded $4 billion and our net earnings to shareholders of nearly $2.5 billion rose 26% year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted EPS rose nearly 23% to $2.66 per share. Medical costs have been well managed within our established outlook range, while trending modestly lower.","The third quarter medical care ratio of 81.4% brought the year-to-date ratio to 82% would suggest we will be closer to the lower side of our full year 2017 outlook of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. The operating cost ratio ticked up 10 basis points sequentially to 14.7% in the third quarter due to the typical seasonally higher levels of operating expense as we prepare for on-boarding new growth in January. Overall, operating costs remain within the range of our expectations even as we see meaningful opportunities to improve our performance in this area.","Cash flows from operations were $7.5 billion in the third quarter or 2.9x net income bringing the year-to-date adjusted figure to 1.6x net income. Third quarter cash flow was driven by strong underlying business performance, working capital management, the absence of an annual insurance tax payment in the quarter, and the annual receipt of payments from CMS that adjust rates to reflect member\u2019s medical conditions. Our strong performance enabled us to reduce our debt to total capital ratio to 38.2% at September 30. Since we acquired Catamaran 2 years ago, we have reduced this ratio by 11 percentage points even as we continue to expand our business portfolio and enhance shareholder value. Over that time, we created a unique, diverse and fully capable pharmacy care service business, continue to build on our OptumCare platform through the acquisition of urgent care, ambulatory surgical and local market physician practices, and distributed nearly $5 billion in dividends repurchasing $2.5 billion in stock.","We have increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted net earnings and now expect to approach $10 per share. This would be a full year growth of 24% and strongly ahead of the original range of $9.30 to $9.60 per share as we communicated at last year\u2019s investor conference. Dave?","David Wichmann","Thank you, John. Before I give a first look at 2018, let me touch briefly on the federal executive order from last week. We have a great deal of experience in the area covered in the order, short-term policies, association plans and expanded use of HRAs. We will be engaging with policymakers as the regulatory frameworks in these areas are developed over the next 60 to 120 days and hope to elaborate once the process has concluded. With regard to cost sharing reductions, you will recall that we have a very limited exchange presence, about 30,000 people in four states who are CSR eligible and we submitted plans for 2018 both with and without the CSR payments. Thus, we expect any impact to be extremely small.","Now, to 2018 as you look at next year, it is important to keep several tailwinds and headwinds front of mind, themes, we have been consistent about over the last several quarters, continued growth, momentum and performance, particularly with customer retention as our NPS disciplines improve, increasingly effective capacities to manage and contain both medical and operating costs, the improving performance and capabilities of our modern operating technology and data analytics infrastructure and ongoing efforts to be strategic investors and thoughtful stewards of the capital you have entrusted to us. With regard to the headwinds, these remain largely around externalities centering on government programs, funding trends and taxes. On the latter, the return of the health insurance tax is the most meaningful. We and others have advocated strongly for the repeal or continued deferral of this tax. It ultimately increases cost to consumers through either increased premiums or benefit reductions and thus affects Medicare beneficiaries, individual policyholders, large and small businesses and Medicaid recipients. Absent the insurance tax reinstatement, we see our 2008 per share earnings squarely in our longstanding 13% to 16% long-term growth range.","In 2018, the insurance tax would represent for us roughly $0.75 per share of comparative year-over-year earnings headwinds. That figure is composed of the rate increase in the tax itself, the effect of our market share gains in commercial and Medicare Advantage since 2016, and the accounting convention that creates a timing gap as it applies to commercial businesses. So as we look toward 2018, we see our per share adjusted earnings within a typically sized range with the top side of that range in line with the current market consensus for 2018 and we see an enterprise with strong momentum and a commitment to performing to its highest potential in 2018 and beyond.","Before opening up for questions, there are a couple of things we would hope you take away from today\u2019s report. First, our businesses are performing well at all levels and particularly for those we serve. We expect to continue to do so in 2018. That performance continues to produce distinctive growth. Second, we have focused initiatives in numerous areas such as innovation, digital health, artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, NPS and advancing a consumer culture. The breadth of these initiatives reflects our restless and ambitious team, one determined to make a difference in healthcare serving one person at a time.","Finally, we are a healthcare company rooted in our core competencies and delivered in benefits and services. Together, UnitedHealthcare and Optum offer distinctive competencies in clinical insight, technology and data and information. As we bring these key capabilities and distinctive value to clients, we are privileged to serve more people and we expect to continue strong growth for a long time. Our goal remains realizing the remarkable growth, service and social potential of this enterprise. We look forward to discussing all of this more with you in more detail at our investor conference in November.","Thank you for your interest today. We will now open the floor to your questions, one question per person please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Good morning. I would like to ask you about 2019 Medicare Advantage plans we have seen good growth in your earnings from Medicare over the last few years. It looks like going into 2019, there is a lot more plans for pricing a little more competitively as well as growing geographically. You had great growth in 2018. Can you talk a little more specifically about what you are thinking having seen everybody else\u2019s plans now for growth in 2019?","David Wichmann","Thank you, Peter. And I appreciate you acknowledging our past growth, I think our team has done a very nice job in building this business and really setting the stage for our continued success in that area. Obviously, we are not commenting on the specifics of 2019, but we will give you some general sense of things. So, I will give it to Steve Nelson.","Steve Nelson","Sure. I assume that question is about 2018.","David Wichmann","Yes, benefits plan probably.","Steve Nelson","Peter, you said 2018.","Peter Costa","2018, sorry about that.","Steve Nelson","Making sure, okay. A lot of work to do between now and \u201819 benefit plan because we are about two days into the selling season for Medicare Advantage and yes, tremendous growth. We have been really focused at UnitedHealthcare across all the businesses to really advance the idea that I mentioned earlier in my comments around distinction and with very key focus on some fundamental areas, substantial growth, advances in quality leveraging our Optum capabilities, managing our costs both administrative and clinical and nowhere has that, I think, shine through more brightly than our Medicare Advantage. So, I think it\u2019s great to have Brian Thompson, our CEO of Medicare shed some light on 2017 and kind of outlook for \u201818 as you kind of see things shaping up.","Brian Thompson","Sure. Thanks, Steve. Peter, good morning. As far as 2017 goes, our performance continues to be very strong, what we are seeing aligns to our expectation. So that really sets the foundation for a robust optimistic outlook both for the industry at large as well as our performance inside 2018. I think what we are seeing as we look at the marketplace for 2018 is very stable benefits broadly, very few exits, very few closures, really great for this team here. I think that will enable continued advances in both popularity as well as the penetration for Medicare Advantage at large. Competitively, no big changes, generally speaking with respect to the competitive landscape, what we are seeing large, it aligns with our expectations. Our offerings in particular remain very strong, very stable, well-positioned for continued growth inside 2018 and we do expect to outpace the industry and growth in 2018.","Peter Costa","I was hoping you give a little color on the group business versus the retail business as well as how you are getting past the health insurance fee?","Brian Thompson","Sure. Peter, with respect to group, obviously 2017 was one of our strongest years ever both in terms of retention and strong growth. I think it can be considered a bit of an anomaly, but certainly don\u2019t want to diminish what is setting up to be a very strong year inside 2018 as well, great growth again in terms of new customers as well as strong retention.","David Wichmann","Okay. Thank you, Peter. Next question please.","Peter Costa","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. First, Dave, congrats on the new role. Secondly, just appreciate the commentary on 2018 very helpful. I think what I would like to try to delineate here is 2017 when they have one away you talked about it, I think your Investor Day, $0.25 tailwind, this year you are talking about it coming back is being a $0.75 headwind. I am just curious if there was a change in the way you passed it through in \u201817 versus as it came back in \u201818. And if you did, for instance, take lower net income target margins than any of your businesses, can you kind of flush that out for us a little bit and little color to background there? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Thanks for the question, Justin and appreciate your acknowledgment of the new role and our guidance on 2018. I will ask John Rex to respond to your question.","JohnRex","Good morning, Justin. Maybe let me give a little more color on that. So, first when we talk about the $0.75 that\u2019s the sizing of the year-over-year earnings growth headwind that\u2019s created from the tax coming back in, I\u2019d say it\u2019s somewhat over two-thirds of that is the explicit 2018 earnings reduction impact that we feel from that, while really the remainder of that. So they are somewhat under one-third derives from that really the tail impact that we saw from our 2017 earnings. If I think about kind of the composition of that and how that breaks down on the 2018 end year I would say more than half of that derives from Medicare Advantage and the non-deductibility of the fee and the restroom commercial risk products. And then as you mentioned really the other part of that $0.75 is just the other side of the tail of the 2017 tailwind. So, that\u2019s really the way it breaks down and overview as we think about the \u201818 impact.","David Wichmann","So, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Justin, we\u2019ll break this down greater at our upcoming investor conference, but we did recognize you would like to get some visibility on its components.","Justin Lake","Thanks.","David Wichmann","Next question, please.","Operator","We will take the next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to flip over to Optum. On OptumInsight, backlog grew nicely, I think previously the target there had been in the $15 billion to $16 billion range to end the year you will need a pretty strong fourth quarter to get there. I wondered if that\u2019s still the view and then OptumInsight has also been running at very attractive margins kind of above the long-term target. Is that sustainable or maybe asked a different way? Are we looking for a kind of higher target range? Are you revising the range up or is there some reason why that might moderate back down into the 16% to 20% range? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Thanks, Dave. Larry Renfro?","LarryRenfro","Dave, it\u2019s Larry. Couple of comments and then I am going to ask Tim Wicks to talk a little bit about this from a financial standpoint and how he sees it in the CFO role and I will ask Eric Murphy to talk about it as the business lead on OptumInsight, but as I know you know the third quarter finished slightly ahead and I would say going into the fourth quarter this is historical for us in terms of what we expect OptumInsight to actually how they will perform in the fourth quarter and they are right in line with our expectation. I think Tim will probably talk a little bit about that we had a pretty large account that came in at the end of the third quarter last year that may have a little bit of impact on the number the way that you are looking at it, but overall I would say that the momentum is very strong and we feel confident in our expectations. So, Tim?","Tim Wicks","Great. Thank, Larry. Dave thanks for the questions. It\u2019s Tim Wicks. Good to talk to you. The question around backlog, I think it\u2019s really important to know that as we hit $13.9 billion this year, it was a really great, strong quarter of sequential growth of $500 million and was led by revenue cycle management, BPL and government businesses. And also I am just noting that number has grown $1.3 billion year-to-date. I would also want to note that it\u2019s important to understand that late in Q3 of 2016, we had a very large end-to-end sale that\u2019s now in implementation. So, a portion of that\u2019s rolled off, but since that time as I mentioned earlier, we have also added $1.3 billion of new sales into that number and the backlog number is now up 11% year-over-year. And I will turn it to Eric to talk about the pipeline.","Eric Murphy","Yes, thanks, Tim. Good morning, Dave. Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. In terms of the specific question you asked about our backlog and our expectations regarding Q4 and for the year, first I will start with \u2013 Q3 was absolutely in line with our expectations relative to our contribution to backlog. We come into Q4 with a very strong pipeline of active pursuits. So, we are very bullish on our ability to be able to achieve our objective as you stated a $15 billion to $16 billion of total backlog for 2017. We anticipate the contributions of that backlog in Q4 being concentrated around our inventory and acute revenue cycle management, where our pipeline is up 60% year-on-year. So, we anticipate a strong finish to Q4 into 2017.","LarryRenfro","So, Dave, it\u2019s Larry, I want to take this back to Tim, because I don\u2019t believe he answered the margin question.","Tim Wicks","Great. Dave, first just to note, you had mentioned the margin at 20.7% for Q3. I think it\u2019s important to note, it\u2019s up 40 basis points from Q3 of 2016, so year-over-year a 40 basis point margin expansion than the same amount September year-to-date. Sequential margin expansion over just the last quarter has been 200 basis points, but as you think about that margin expansion just consistent with prior years, we anticipate being continued sequential margin expansion in Q4 and that\u2019s really driven by seasonality in the business whether it\u2019s perpetual sales or additional performance and incentive fee payments that we expect to see at the end of the year as well as Optum360 content sales and other technology and data and software sales. So, we expect this seasonality and we see it each year as we roll through the year and would expect the kind of Q4 seasonality that we have had previously, but not a real expectation to change our overall outlook to anything higher than what it is right now.","Dave Windley","Okay, thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to share your comments around trend so far this year, how it\u2019s coming in what\u2019s been maybe you think that it\u2019s coming in towards the lower end of what you are looking for and if there is any impact of the hurricanes in Q3 and potentially in Q4?","David Wichmann","Thank you, Kevin. As in our prepared remarks, we said that our trend is expect to be less than 6%, so within the lower end of the 6% plus or minus 50 basis point range that we had provided at the investor conference last year. Overall, it\u2019s looking strong. Our team does a very nice job of containing healthcare costs, but let me ask Jeff Putnam, our Chief Financial Officer of UnitedHealthcare to add some details and then maybe I will make a few comments on the hurricanes.","Jeff Putnam","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, Kevin. I\u2019d like to start our medical cost trend reflects our efforts everyday that we do to manage costs and improve clinical quality on behalf of our customers and we are driving this in several ways through traditional focus on medical cost management initiatives, getting at the right level of care at the right place of service. We are also increasing the effectiveness of our clinical model with additional focus on those with the greatest need and getting them connected to the right care. And we are increasing the alignment of our provider partnerships leveraging data and aligning incentives. As Dave mentioned, we are talking about our \u2013 looking at our 2017 trend to be below 6%, but that\u2019s still within the lower half of our original range from a year ago and you have to defer a little color on where we are seeing it, overall unit cost continues to be the primary driver and we look at it by category. It\u2019s really broad-based. We are seeing trend shift slightly downward across all categories and then there isn\u2019t anything specific that I call out around that.","David Wichmann","And then Kevin, as for the hurricanes, obviously it\u2019s been an unprecedented time period and it\u2019s been a really powerful and inspiring time to see how our employees have pulled together to help people that we serve and frankly their fellow employees as well in the communities broadly. I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank the countless women and men of our organization that gave so selflessly during this timeframe and continue to do so today. We invested heavily in the aftermath of these storms we provided financial relief for employees. We helped our customers get back on their feet. We worked with state leadership and we provided all kinds of financial assistance and in-kind services for the relief efforts in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. So, there is typically some level of utilization offset, but I want to remind you that in the case of Optum, there is also lost revenue from reduced utilization. These are significant markets for our OptumCare businesses and then we had of course a fair amount of direct damage to our business as well as the financial effects of all these relief efforts. So in the end, we didn\u2019t really pay a whole lot of attention to the financial impact if you will, but because that wasn\u2019t what was most important at the time, but in the end it ended up being not material to our overall performance.","Kevin Fischbeck","I guess, regarding the Q4 potential implications, I mean, if you are pointing to a lot of instructions going on and I think a lot of people are expecting how did that plan to accelerate costs Q4 volumes just to be seasonally stronger every year. Do you feel like you have got good visibility into that trend in Q4 that there is any disruption as far as claims processing or anything like that, that might create an issue for you one way or the other?","David Wichmann","We believe we have good visibility to our business and we don\u2019t see disruption is affecting our Q4 results.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, thanks.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Kevin. Next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Yes, thank you. Could you just talk to not necessarily looking for more numbers here on the question from Justin earlier regarding the\u2026","David Wichmann","Matt, it\u2019s very difficult to hear you. You are breaking up, are you on\u2026?","Matt Borsch","I am sorry, how about that? Is that better?","David Wichmann","Much, much, thank you very much.","Matt Borsch","Thank you. So, my question was picking up on the health insurer fee resumption. I am not necessarily looking for more numbers, but just sort of qualitatively you talked about more than \u2013 sorry more than half from MA and the two-thirds of the $0.75, so the rest of it presumably on the commercial side. Is that getting to the fact that in the small group market or where is it the commercial was not entirely a pass-through at least with respect perhaps to the tax grows up and has there been any change in the pricing environment that you are reflecting in the way that you are handling the health insurer fee relative to what you have done in the last few years?","David Wichmann","I\u2019ll let John to respond.","JohnRex","Yes. Matt, on the commercial side of that, that has to do just with the accounting convention on the commercial business in terms of the periods that one collects the tax and recognizes that and the period that one expenses it. So for any piece of business that\u2019s other than the January 1 renewal date, there is going to be some gap in the timing that occur. So, we had called out that one of the tailwinds in 2017 was the result of that.","Matt Borsch","Right.","JohnRex","That flips into a headwind for us in 2018, because we get the full expense recognition in 2018. So, that smoothes out over a few years, but it creates the thing or the 2-year variability.","Matt Borsch","Got it. Thank you. If I could just sneak in one other question here, is there anything to read into the \u2013 or maybe you can just talk to any circumstances around the loss of that the 500,000 public sector account and does that reflect anything in the competitive environment for a self-funded business?","David Wichmann","No, I will ask Jeff Alter to touch on it. It was a single account. There is nothing particularly unique about it other than we happen to lose this one and unfortunately so for, Jeff.","JeffAlter","Yes, good morning Matt. As Dave said, I think you have to think of this account as a very unique circumstances extremely large account. We were honored to serve them well through a number of renewals. We see very disciplined in our pricing on both admin and the projection of that client\u2019s healthcare costs during this renewal. And unfortunately, we weren\u2019t chosen to continue to work with that client. I would say we remain focused in serving that client and their members really well during this run-out period and we hope to be in position to compete again the next time that client puts their business out for bid.","Matt Borsch","Alright. Thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Matt. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","MichaelBaker","Yes, thanks. Just want to get some your perspective on the potential opportunity for more active management of state Medicaid formularies in light of the Massachusetts waiver that was filed?","David Wichmann","I will ask John Prince to comment.","John Prince","Good morning. This is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. Michael, in terms of the question around state Medicaid formularies, I am probably going to get into detail the specific Medicaid plan overall. We are very pleased to be very involved with Dave\u2019s. It\u2019s a very large business for us. We actually support state from fee-for-service Medicaid in terms of their design and plan. We also support a variety of managed care Medicaid plans in their design. I think most states are looking at different strategies to create more affordability for their customers. We have been very successful in that market working with states around designs that get out of affordability further ongoing plans beneficiaries as well as trying to become more consumer-oriented. I am not going to get into specifics on a given state, but overall, it\u2019s a very solid market, where people are very focused on value and experience.","David Wichmann","Good question, Michael. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Actually, at this point, my important questions have been answered. So, I will just let you proceed. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Gary. Next question please.","Operator","And we can go next to Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Good morning. I was just hoping to get a little more color on the increase in the favorable reserve development year-to-year? And then if you could give us any color on the relative performance in the business lines, commercial, Medicare and Medicaid? That will be great. Thanks.","David Wichmann","Well, I think our development is indicative of the cost containment efforts across our enterprise and we have \u2013 I will ask Jeff Putnam to comment on its components.","Jeff Putnam","Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, as Dave mentioned, we are working to control medical costs and improve quality. And our development this quarter reflects that as well as a modest change in claims processing timelines and both these, they take some time to mature and get their way into our claims data and reserving as we maintain a very consistent and tightly controlled process. And with this, when you step up and look at this, we are pleased with the overall accuracy and consistency of our reserving over time, especially when you look at $117 billion in medical spend last year and approaching $130 billion this year. By business as you know we don\u2019t break that out specifically, but I would offer that both our commercial and government businesses recorded favorable development this quarter.","David Wichmann","And then maybe Steve Nelson can touch on overall performance.","Steve Nelson","Sure. Hi, Chris. So, as I mentioned in my earlier comments really excited about the performance across all of our businesses. We are really well-positioned and we see a lot of opportunity. So, maybe I will just ask Dan Schumacher to comment broadly on, I think particularly of note is the strong performance we have had in fully insured and then maybe Austin Pittman could just share a little perspective on the Medicaid \u2013 managed Medicaid opportunity continues to be a strong growth opportunity for us.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Thanks, Steve. Chris, to your question around performance in each of our businesses, we are performing from an earnings perspective in line with or better than our expectations. And probably within that, I would highlight to Steve Nelson\u2019s point, our commercial business is standing out a little bit. And that really is built on very strong growth foundations. So, we are doing well on the fully insured side. We have grown that over the last 3 years as we mentioned in the prepared remarks by 1.1 million lives and inside the year, we are doing better than what we had expected when we got together a year ago at the investor conference. So, really strong growth and underpinning that is some really potential efforts that we have made over the last several years to broaden our product portfolio so that we could pair that with highest performing positions and be able to create price points in our offering that can appeal to a broader spectrum all the way from our largest clients down to our smaller clients. And then I think also worth mentioning is some of the advances we have made in not only our clinical model and medical management, but our innovations around the consumer both our advocates on the phone as well as in our digital experiences and a lot of that is in partnership with very strong partnership with Optum. So, those are some of the things that are contributing to the strong commercial performance.","David Wichmann","Yes, thanks, Dan. I will just comment on the Medicaid market overall. It continues to be a very strong marketplace, very active. We are honored with recent new market wins in Virginia as well as in Missouri. We have had important renewals recently with Louisiana and Colorado, Arizona LTSS, so again really strong performance across the board I think in recognition of the value that we are bringing to our state partners. Because we look forward, we have got a very strong pipeline over 20 RFPs in-house. That pipeline is shaping up pretty heavily with a turn towards populations of very complex needs, which really plays to the strength of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We have carved out a very distinctive capability in serving those populations. So, again, it\u2019s a strong marketplace. I think states continue to look to manage Medicaid that deliver value in predictability and cost as well as importantly increasing the quality to the individuals that we serve. So, we are very, very bullish about the future of that marketplace. So, hopefully, you are getting a good sense of the consistency of the performance of the business across the board that we are referring to in our prepared remarks. I might add to that, that our international business, our global business has performed nicely year-over-year as well. Nice progression in particular coming from our colleagues down in the meal.","Chris Rigg","Thanks a lot.","David Wichmann","Yes, thanks. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. The theme of consumers on high deductible plans has been having an increasing impact on the industry in cost terms and I think United has the most work here understanding the dynamics\u2026.","David Wichmann","Sarah, we are struggling to hear your question as well.","Sarah James","Sorry. So, the theme of consumers on the high deductible plans has been having an increasing impact on the industry in cost terms. And I think United has done the most work in understanding the dynamics of consumer behavior, deductibles and HFA balances. So, can you talk big picture where do you see high deductible plans going as a percent of the commercial market, what\u2019s the growth profile there and can you give us an idea of the cost trend differential or initial headwind to cost trends experience when a consumer moves to high deductible plans from a traditional commercial plan?","David Wichmann","So, these plan designs have been heavily sought after and have been a key contributor to our growth in part because of our ability to offer an account like an HSA alongside them are in HRA as well. So, it\u2019s been a considerable growth category for us and it\u2019s expected to continue to rise, but evolve and become more modern with greater focus on tailoring products and networks to individual consumer needs whether they be individual policies or in the case of a group A\u2019s policies, the individuals inside those groups, but maybe I will have Jeff Alter provide some additional color on or Dan Schumacher.","Jeff Alter","Sure. Thanks, Dave. Good morning, Sarah. Just for context as you look at our portfolio across our self-funded and fully insured clients just a shade under 30% of our enrollment base is in consumer-directed offerings, a little less so in our fully insured offerings and a little more so inside of our self-funded offerings. And so we have seen some very nice take up in that over time as employers increasingly look to that as a vehicle to help continue to offer high-value benefits at a more reasonable price. In terms of sizing the delta as people step into initially into consumer directed and then what it does over time, I think obviously if that varies considerably based on where people set those attachment points and deductibles, but needless to say that there is a very, very meaningful first year benefit depending on how you structure it and we have seen improved performance on a trend basis relatively speaking over time in our high deductible offerings.","David Wichmann","Thank you for your questions, Sarah. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Sheryl Skolnick","Thank you very much. So, forgive me, but I am going to make an observation here on, it is both comforting and remarkable in a positive way to note the consistency not only of the very strong results across the enterprise, but also the presentation and commentary and guidance and a brilliant debut, David and I don\u2019t say that for any reason other than must not be easy to come in front of all of us asking out the questions on your first earnings call and this is certainly a good way to start, but that consistency is important and the way I look at the company both in terms of the growth and in terms of the de-leveraging in the capital deployment which is where my question is going here. So, you have now returned to stellar ROE performance 22% plus, you\u2019ve got your debt to total capital under 30% at 38% presumably with the kind of growth you are talking about this year and next year there is more room and you have from what I see a multitude of opportunities, David is the keeper of the keys has been involved in so many of the acquisitions that the company has made and you are now sitting on top of the organization what\u2019s the next strategic direction in terms of capital deployment. I know the basic formula, but where are the interesting things that United needs to go and do whether it\u2019s internally or externally to take the company beyond where it is today?","David Wichmann","Thank you for your kind remarks, Sheryl. I appreciate that. As you might suspect this transition was architected by Steve Hemsley in our board and they have done a fantastic job and I guess that should be no surprise to anyone. And thank you for your acknowledgment of the performance of the business. It does continue to advance quite nicely. All that said, we are not yet performing at our full potential and there is a lot of opportunity for this organization to continue to improve to better serve people to grow organically as well as deploy capital in ways that it has in the past with maybe a slight tilt in direction overall. As you know, we haven\u2019t invested in a significant health plan in nearly 8 years. We do, do some small plug-in acquisitions here and there and largely for the purpose to enter into a new market and\/or to gain some kind of competency that allows us to better serve people more nationally. So, the vast majority of what you have seen from us in terms of focus on the UnitedHealthcare front has been to drive an organic growth agenda and then to push more globally. And when I talk about globally I mean selectively globally, we entered into Brazil, we felt that, that was a good market. It is turning out to \u2013 as it continues to evolve to in fact be a good market and we look forward to the day when the political climate and regulatory and economic climates of Brazil shape up. We think that, that will be a nice growth category for the middle class and as a result will lead to nice growth in our business. You probably saw that we extended that into some initial activities in Chile, Colombia and Peru through the pre-announced acquisition that\u2019s underway with the Medica. That is \u2013 the combination of those two give us the type of South American presence that we believe we can leverage to serve the people of South America and they in a broader way recognizing fully that not all markets are investible. So, global will be part of it, but I would say measured global investments. The more significant investments that we will make going forward particularly on the growth front will be through Optum as we have in the past. As John articulated in the prepared remarks, we have formed the pharmacy care services business, which frankly allowed us to have a foundation from which to reinvent that business if you will meaning bringing greater technological capacities, bringing our synchronization story and capacities there as well as also addressing some of the transparency issues that exists in that market overall. We believe we can add considerable innovative value to evolving that.","Second of that would be are really where a lot of our investments are today is really in the healthcare delivery space, particularly in the ambulatory context across certain major markets in the United States. You have seen us move out on those obviously their smaller acquisitions, they may not show up as much, but the Optumcare business is one which we have grown nicely through local care practices establishing a foundation in urgent care, continuing to leverage our nurse at home capacities that came from the XLHealth acquisition dating back to 2011 I believe and \u201812 excuse me and then also the recent addition of our surgical capacities. So, Andrew Hayek and his team are continuing to build that business on an organic de novo as well as through the deployment of capital. And then I think, you will see us also move heavily in this area around technology and taking advantage of the vast assets that this company has in information and data leveraging that more distinctly like you have seen us with Rally, which was a pre-revenue company 3 years ago. Now, it\u2019s a distinctive consumer digital health capacity in the industry. We will continue to do the same on the healthcare delivery front as well as find ways to create greater value out of the data assets to better serve healthcare communities broadly. So, I\u2019d say those are the directions that we are headed with, so biased towards investing in Optum, but I would like to just underscore that our capital deployment philosophies will be consistent with what you have seen in the past. It\u2019s important for us to drive strong returns and liquidity for our shareholders. We will continue to see our dividend move to a market rate and we will be balanced about how we manage our debt positions as well.","Sheryl Skolnick","Perfect. Thank you so much.","David Wichmann","Thank you for your questions. Next question, please.","Operator","We will go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask you about OptumRx and the clinical synchronization model that you have tied to medical membership up-sale and margins relative to what you are seeing now with the standalone providers like expressed having pressure retail same-store sales down and your thoughts about potential entry and your response to maybe Amazon coming in which is being speculated?","David Wichmann","Okay, there is a lot there, Ana. I will ask John Prince to respond and maybe I will give you a few comments on Amazon at the end.","John Prince","Sure. Thank you, Ana. It\u2019s John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. I will cover a couple of parts. So, I think the first part was around sync and the second one is just sort of the broader market and then lastly is entrance to Amazon and others. So, in terms of sync, our strategy hasn\u2019t changed. Our focus is around how you solve fundamental issues in healthcare, one is driving and that\u2019s the best net cost and pharmacy cost for our customers. The second one is how we improve the total cost in healthcare. And I think that is where we are differentiated in the market where with our capabilities at Optum, we are able to actually solve that total cost of healthcare. We had a earlier version of that in the market, the last 2 years. We have done with UnitedHealthcare with other health plans direct from markets. It\u2019s actually created a great value in the market. We are now pivoting that to a broader solution. So, we have a new version of sync which we are out in the market selling. It actually not only leverages the touch point of the phone call, how you actually saw borders in the healthcare, but we are actually very focused on what happens with the prescribing physicians, what happens in the doctor\u2019s office and how it can influence that. We are focused on our digital assets, which is where a lot of transactions happen in healthcare. And we are very focused on what happens in retail setting and have a lot of partnerships in that retail setting. So, we are taking things to the next level.","In terms of the second question, which is on market pressure, at a broader level, I think the market is very active. I think it is very interested in the solution. We have actually had a really good selling season. We actually have had a lot of good wins to the market. And I think that shows that people are very interested in a new story around what drives value as well as what drives experience. And so I\u2019d say the market is very robust, very interested in value and that\u2019s actually to working out. So, we are going to end the season with a retention in the high 90s as well as a very strong selling season. So, I think we are in very good position in terms of looking at broader market. The last piece is let me cover Amazon in terms of the market. And I will frame that discussion from a broader context. So, as you look at what we are focused on from an OptumRx standpoint, we are focused on creating the next generations of pharmacy care models. And as part of that as I mentioned before, we are focused on total cost healthcare leverage and that model is also very focused on achieving a member\u2019s health and wellness goal on behalf of our clients. So, it\u2019s a very different model that really leverages clinical expertise and it\u2019s at the heart of what differentiates us in the market. As it relates to partners in the market, we are channel agonistic. So, our perspective is that we will meet a consumer where and how they want to be served. So, as you look at various retail partners, we are open to new distribution partners. We are willing to partner with anybody that drives value, decrease cost and also improves the consumer experience. So we are open to any partner out there that actually addressed that. Our history has been very effective. So today, we have deep relationships with CVS, with Walgreens and with other partners in the market and we are open to \u2013 we will continue those types of partnerships.","David Wichmann","I think you addressed any commentary. I might say, I was really just going to talk broadly about partnerships. The business has done a nice job of partnering with the marketplace broadly in the past and in no time will that become more important than the future as well. So, we will continue to engage with innovative and thought leading organizations and seek to serve consumers better managing their healthcare needs in helping make health systems work better for everyone. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. I wanted to go back to MA. Can you help us think about typical margin profile in year one at MA versus rapid improvement, you have historically seen kind of into year two, when do you get that to sort of full mature margins and then help us think about any difference between that ramp for individual versus group? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Brian?","Brian Thompson","Hi, Ralph. Yes, this is Brian Thompson. I won\u2019t get into the specifics. What I can share with you is obviously as we approach 2018, the return of the tax is the biggest headwind. The good news for us is our own internal advancements are really meaningfully helping us reduce that tax impact to those that we serve first and foremost is our quality advance, secondarily is the productivity and scale that we get from that growth. And then to your point, perhaps the biggest tailwind for us is that strong clinical engagement that we did in year one that we see come to fruition in year two. So, it\u2019s certainly the biggest momentum driver for us as we prepare for the return of the tax in 2018.","Ralph Giacobbe","And what about group versus individual?","David Wichmann","It\u2019s very comparable.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Thank you.","David Wichmann","Thank you, Ralph. Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Zack Sopcak","Thanks for the question. So, Dave in your opening comments, you touched briefly on the capital plans covered in the executive order. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit of color on the experience you had with those, were they meaningful and maybe it\u2019s hard to say at this point, but how margins may have historically been in those businesses versus those were typically accustomed to?","David Wichmann","Yes, thank you Zack, good question. I am going to ask \u2013 we do have considerable experience with short-term plans. I am going to ask Dan Schumacher to comment.","DanSchumacher","Sure, thanks, Zack. Good morning. So, probably addressed the association as well as the short duration plan, so on the association front, the reality is we have got decades long experience in that. Actually, our individual business was founded on an association and we likewise support associations in our group business. All told, we have got about 300,000 members in association plans today. So we have got a lot of experience, the performance is strong and I would say generally in keeping with our broader portfolio. And so we will look forward to engaging the dialogue around how they could shape going forward. On the short duration policies, obviously, the regulation that came in on April 1 that reduced the amount of links of the plans has been challenging for the marketplace. And so we are excited to see that extended to the full year, because the reality is it provides a bridge for people in between coverage. It\u2019s a lot more affordable option. It provides very strong access and value to consumers. And the reality is before that regulation we saw incredible increase in the growth as the cost of exchange offerings have grown and it\u2019s been a bridge for people. So, we look to continue to support people as hopefully the duration of those plans gets extended.","David Wichmann","Thank you for your question, Zack. We have time for one more question.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take that question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christine Arnold","Good morning. Thanks for putting me in. I think that we really haven\u2019t delved in as much detail as some of the other things as OptumHealth and recognizing that as a tailwind to your 10% to 15% top line target as well as your 8% to 10% margin target. How should we think about that business performing over the next couple of years in the context of that top line and margin assumption putting SCA aside? I know you are still investing a lot in that business. So, was that 8% to 10% margin something we should be thinking about near-term or should we think about that as a longer term target? Thanks.","David Wichmann","Maybe I will ask Tim to comment on the margin and then maybe Andrew can provide some comments about where we are headed with the business.","Tim Wicks","Sure, great. Thanks, Christine. So, as we think about the year today, reported margin grew 50 basis points year-over-year and 160 basis points sequentially driven by FDA. In addition, there was margin expansion from our care delivery businesses, HouseCalls and financial services as well and overall OptumHealth earnings grew 27% while we make strategic investments in the platform much as you represented. I think as you look at those investments, really important to think about that we make those investments in businesses that we have an intent to grow and those investments are designed to further improve that ability to grow and that\u2019s really evidenced even in this most recent reporting period around our revenue growth at OptumHealth of 21% year-over-year for the third quarter. I turn it over to Andrew to talk specifically about the areas of investment and market areas, where we are making those investments across platforms.","Andrew Hayek","Thanks, Tim and thanks for the question, Christine. So, we are pleased to be at the higher end of our range of 8% to 10% margin in the third quarter. And as Tim mentioned, we continue to balance current profitability with making investments in future growth and some examples of those are investing to help transition physician groups from fee-for-service to value-based contracts, which does require an investment period. Second is investing to ramp up new contracts and as Larry mentioned in his prepared remarks, in our military and veterans segment as an example for contracts commencing in 2018. And thirdly is opening new MedExpress locations. And as you would imagine that requires an investment as each location ramps up to profitability. So given this, we expect our margin to continue to fluctuate over time and be in that range of 8% to 10%. We will continue to balance current profitability with investing and we were pleased with the 27% growth year-over-year in the quarter. There is strong performance across most of our businesses, local care delivery, HouseCalls, behavioral, financial services, consumer engagement. And so we were bullish on the business and we will continue to balance investing with current profitability.","David Wichmann","Great. And Larry?","Larry Renfro","So, Christine, it\u2019s Larry Renfro. I just want to make a couple of comments that one is kind of a commercial here on the military side, we have a new senior executive leader here by the name of General Patty Horoho. She has joined us about 5 months ago and she is leading the effort in the OptumHealth side of the military programs and I might ask \u2013 just ask her in a second to comment on a couple of the programs that are coming through on the military side. The other piece that I would add into this is that we have Optum360 that is part of our OptumInsight organization that utilizes OptumHealth as well in a lot its programs, especially when we do, do programs with major organizations that we have worked with on the West Coast and the East Coast. So that\u2019s tying in as well when you get to the physician groups and surgery centers and so forth. So, to keep it short, so Patty, would you mind just talking a little bit about what you are working on and give everybody a little [indiscernible].","Patty Horoho","Thank you, Larry and good morning. I have the honor to join Optum about 6 months ago after 33 years of experience culminating as the 43rd U.S. Army Surgeon General. And what we have been able to do is really leverage and find ways to transform our healthcare system from one that treats diseases to one that promotes good health. And so two of our newest 5-year contracts kept in the September of this year, we began performing the medical disability event for military veterans on behalf of the Veterans Benefit Administration. And through this contract, we provide exams in 44 states in the District of Columbia. The second 5-year contract is the TRICARE Global Nurse Advice Line, where we will operate the Military Health System\u2019s Global Nurse Advice Line starting in 2018 and this is our frontline nurse advice care coordination line offered 24 hours a day utilizing telehealth capability to military service members, retirees and their families worldwide. And what I would just say is that this is just the beginning of our ability to serve our military, their families and our veterans and we are just getting started. Thank you.","David Wichmann","Great. So, I think you could take from that that our bench is deep and continues to get deeper. Welcome, General Horoho and thank you Christine for your comments.","David Wichmann","So, I will wrap briefly with this. UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare are intently focused on fulfilling the healthcare needs of the people and customers we serve. As we had distinct tangible value to healthcare, we continue to grow at a sustainable market leading pace. We expect to continue this trajectory through the remainder of 2017 into 2018 and for the decade ahead. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at our investor conference in New York on November 28. Thank you for joining us and for your continued interest in our enterprise.","Operator","And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Security (sic) [Securities Laws]. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amount is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 19, 2012, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2011 and discuss the potential we see to better serve our customers and markets in 2012. We're committed to continuing to elevate our performance this year as we outlined in our Investor Conference just about a month ago.","2011 was a strong year across a wide range of performance factors. Continued focus on fundamental execution improved service and value for our customers. Financial performance was driven by revenue growth across all of our businesses, including from new business relationships and strong retention of our established clients. Relentless cost management and continued business simplification were prevailing themes in 2011, and innovation and development activities for new markets advanced steadily throughout the year, as we strengthened key capabilities to respond to emerging growth opportunities.","For many years now, we have focused on the combination of fundamental execution and practical innovation to yield value and performance from our assets for the benefit of those we serve. We concentrate our efforts on 2 market-facing business platforms: UnitedHealthcare for health benefits and Optum for health services. Both leverage our common competencies. This enterprise-wide focuses enabled us to steadily advance year after year, compounding our gains over time. Today, UnitedHealth Group is more capable and considerably more nimble than just 5 years ago. This enables us to better respond to the pace of change required to lead in serving the core needs of the healthcare market. Our commitment remains for this enterprise to adapt and grow at a market-leading pace and deliver consistently superior performance to customers.","We will begin with some 2011 highlights and then turn to a more detailed review of UnitedHealthcare and Optum's recent progress and growth. UnitedHealth Group earned $4.73 per share in 2011, an improvement of 15% year-over-year. Cash flows from operations of $7 billion were once again more than 1.3x full year net earnings. Revenues approached $102 billion, up nearly $8 billion from 2010. Full year revenues grew 8%, with revenues growing 7% at UnitedHealthcare and increasing by 21% for the Optum businesses.","The 2011 operating margin of 8.3% was stronger than when -- than we are -- we originally expected and close to the level achieved in 2010. Our 2011 operating cost ratio increased 10 basis points to 15.3% due to an overall increase in regulatory readiness and compliance costs and to the rapidly growing level of fee-based and service revenues.","Fourth quarter adjusted operating cash flows of $2 billion brought full year cash flows from operations to $7 billion, an increase of $700 million or 11% over 2010. Total dividends paid increased 45% year-over-year in 2011. And we repurchased $3 billion in shares, $500 million more than the upper end of our plan for the year.","We completed a fourth quarter debt offering at the lowest net interest rates in the history of our company. And we ended the year with a ratio of debt to debt plus equity of 29%, a 1-percentage point reduction from 2010. At year end, we held a strong available cash position of $1.6 billion. ","Let's review how these results were driven by our complimentary business platforms.","UnitedHealthcare's growth performance has been distinctive in the marketplace. Over the past 2 years, we have grown to serve 2.6 million more people, with at least 6-figure advances in individuals served in every product category over that time. Fee-based commercial actually saw a 7-figure growth. Fourth quarter 2011 growth was well balanced, with increases of 70,000 people served for Employer & Individual, 40,000 people for UnitedHealthcare Community & State, 65,000 people for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and 25,000 people in stand-alone Part D.","For full year 2011, the Employer & Individual business grew by nearly 1.1 million people, with gains in risk-based products of 145,000 people and fee-based offerings of 915,000. 2011 was the best UnitedHealthcare commercial growth performance in a decade. Our results reflect our emphasis on newer, more affordable products, consumer-friendly innovation and stronger local market relationships and engagement with the people we serve. ","Consumer engagement is central to our health benefits value proposition because improving patients' decisions, whether related to lifestyle or access to care, is critical to their total health. One effective tool for engaging consumers is aligning financial incentives with healthy actions. Our UnitedHealth Personal Rewards products offer consumers incentives, such as a reduction in their premiums for completing biometric screening, participating in education programs when needed and demonstrating compliance with care programs.","Since its introduction in 2010, both new and existing customers had -- have embraced the distinctive benefit offering. And we now serve nearly 1 million people in Personal Rewards incentive designs. This has been one of the most successful commercial product launches in the history of UnitedHealthcare.","Another key component to consumer engagement comes from the power of consumer information. The emerging intersection of consumer health information and enabling technology makes it possible for people to more easily take greater control of their health. Last week, UnitedHealthcare and Optum exhibited at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. They demonstrated nearly a dozen innovations ranging from fitness gaming, to $45 Telehealth doctor appointments, to a new portfolio of health applications for mobile phones and tablets, to a highly personalized treatment cost estimator. These are innovations that empower consumers with better, more accessible information and help them improve their health and well-being.","2012 is off to a solid start in Employer & Individual, with fee-based growth tracking favorable to plan and risk-based performance on plan. As we discussed at the Investor Conference, we project risk-based membership to decrease in January, followed by improvements over the balance of the year. The majority of the January 2012 decrease is due to the loss of 1 public sector client and 2 public sector funding conversions to our fee-based products. Client retention appears stronger this January than last year for both risk-based and fee-based products. ","In Medicare & Retirement, Medicare Advantage finished the year with growth of 25,000 seniors in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year increase to 170,000. Our net new January Medicare Advantage growth will position us to achieve the 250,000 to 300,000 2012 growth we targeted at our Investor Conference outlook prior to the pending Excel Health acquisition. Excel Health is moving through the regulatory approval process and should close on schedule in the first half of 2012.","In Part D stand-alone, we added another 25,000 members in the fourth quarter to close with growth of 325,000 in 2011. As you know, the low-income market benchmark priced below our bids for 2012. We estimate that we enter January down approximately 625,000 people on a net basis. We believe we will grow from this level over the balance of the year in the open retail market, which provides more favorable returns. Due to the slow start, year-end 2012 membership for Part D may be lower than our initial expectations from November. ","Medicare Supplement continued to deliver consistent and dependable growth performance, which we expect to repeat in 2012. Supplemental products provide an important balance of offering, serving the needs of seniors both individuals and groups.","In Community & State, our Medicaid business grew by 40,000 people in the fourth quarter, bringing full year growth to 205,000 through a combination of new business awards, program expansions and market share growth. We expect 2012 growth above 2011 strong results, as more of our nation's Medicaid population move into coordinated care programs and the eligibility for Medicaid begins to expand in 2014.","In that vein, we were honored to learn earlier this week that we qualified as a successful bidder for the State of Washington's managed Medicaid expansion. Longer term, the intersection of Medicaid and Medicare for so-called dual eligible members is gaining greater attention from policymakers.","The combination of Excel Health with our organization's existing depth in -- of experience and serving the needs of dual eligibles further strengthens our capabilities in this area and positions us well to help meet the growing demands of this market segment.","Our full year consolidated medical care ratio of 80.8% increased 20 basis points from last year, with the fourth quarter increasing 10 basis points year-over-year. Reserve development was not significantly different between years. In the full year, UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio of 80.9% was 30 basis points better than our estimate at our Investor Conference. Overall, the rate of increase in use of the medical delivery system remains moderate across our benefits businesses. By far, unit costs continue to be the most significant trend driver, particularly in inpatient settings.","As we previously reported to you, we generally saw evidence of increasing utilization in the second half of 2011, especially as compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2010, when utilization trends were essentially flat. This was most prominent in outpatient and physician office settings. We expect higher utilization trends to continue steadily throughout 2012. ","To summarize UnitedHealthcare, diversified top line growth continues to be the central story for our health benefits businesses. UnitedHealthcare earnings from operations of $7.2 billion increased 7% year-over-year, driven by revenue growth of 7% and productivity gains in operations, partially offset by the impact of new premium rebate obligations.","Optum, our health services business platform, produced strong growth in 2011, with revenues up 21% to $28.7 billion. Total earnings were just over $1.25 billion, fourth quarter earnings from operations were $279 million, with operating earnings at each business unit slightly outperforming our most recent expectations.","To touch briefly on each of Optum's businesses, OptumHealth's revenues exceeded $6.7 billion in 2011, a year characterized by gains in capabilities and growth in a wide range of markets. OptumHealth services will become even more valuable to the medical delivery system if care providers increasingly share in the financial responsibility for managing health and healthcare costs for broad groups of their patients.","OptumHealth is expert in 2 key areas for improving both health outcomes and costs: one, consumer engagement and decision making, including selecting the highest-quality venue for care; and two, provider engagement relative to the alignment of benefit design and the consistent use of high-quality and resource-sufficient evidence-based care practices. ","OptumHealth delivered services to 2 million more unique individuals in the past year. OptumHealth now serves approximately 60 million people. This includes 700,000 patients through its collaborative care medical delivery network, more than 40% of these patients have a pair other than UnitedHealthcare, illustrating both the reach and neutrality of this business. ","OptumHealth Financial Services continued -- continues to grow. It added another 260,000 consumer accounts and increased customer assets under management by $350 million or 31% in 2011.","OptumHealth's earnings from operations of $423 million decreased year-over-year, as we fully expected when we realigned this business at the beginning of 2011. From that re-based starting point, OptumHealth has exceeded our performance expectations to full year operating margin of 6.3% also met expectations, and we fully expect to steadily improve this performance as it grows, more fully integrates and matures.","OptumInsight's revenues of $2.7 billion increased 14% year-over-year. OptumInsight had strong sales performance in 2011 and enters 2012 with significant momentum across the business. Adjusting for the divestiture of the clinical trials business, OptumInsight sales bookings grew 27%. And contract revenue backlog increased a similar 26% on a comparable basis to $4 billion.","The number of clients willing to recommend OptumInsight doubled over the past year. We provided compliant services to more than 600 new hospital customers, and we are in discussions with dozens of organizations about services related to their formation of accountable care disciplines. ","OptumInsight's earnings from operations increased 34% on an adjusted basis to $381 million. The full year operating margin of 14.3% improved significantly, and we expect strong margin and earnings gains for 2012 as well.","OptumRx grew revenues by 15% to $19.3 billion in 2011. This revenue growth was driven by an increase of 2 million people served and the growing mix of higher-revenue specialty pharmaceuticals. OptumRx earnings from operations of $457 million decreased 14% in 2011 due in part to investments to support future growth. This included technology to support its expanding services to the UnitedHealthcare commercial business, as well as its related implementation of a new, more flexible mail processing system.","For the overall Optum platform, we outperformed in 2011 due to strong sales growth, contributions from new businesses and more consistent, disciplined operating performance; in a word, execution. ","We expect 2012 to be a stronger performance year, as well as a building year, with accelerating performance in 2013 and 2014. This period will be defined by organic growth, driven by increasing customer demand for our technology and services offerings, operating margin advances and the benefits of our in-sourcing the remaining portion of UnitedHealthcare's commercial PBM services.","What we hope you are sensing is that UnitedHealthcare and Optum are distinct yet powerfully complimentary business platforms. UnitedHealthcare brings scale and market innovation pressure to Optum while leveraging Optum's distinctive capabilities. We share common relationships enterprise-wide, from regulators to care providers, the government and other benefit sponsors in pharma, both as customer and as supplier. The work we do across both of these platforms can serve to deepen the value delivered and the quality of those relationships.","This breath of engagement is critical to our distinctive market presence, our brands and our strengthening reputation. No one on the services side of healthcare has established comparable market scope and presence.","Through the capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, we have emerged as the market leader in the essential confidence of care management, operating in more venues than others and with better integrated data, technology and outcomes.","Our technology is emerging as a distinct enabler in operating advantage. Optum will take responsibility for externally marketing our enterprise technology in 2012, as we look to further externalize the cloud-based assets we've been developing. When taken in concert with our mobile health applications and the operation of roughly 2,500 dedicated healthcare Internet portals, you can begin to appreciate the scope and potential we bring to clients and the market overall. ","That technology is fed by distinctive data and analytical applications and skills. UnitedHealthcare is one of the most prolific health data producers in the country. Optum is expert at translating data into information that can be used to analyze costs and performance, compare clinical effectiveness, execute predictive modeling and provide decision-making information to consumers, care providers, other payers and the government.","Our cultural embrace of innovation as a discipline engages both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. UnitedHealthcare ideas help drive the innovation dynamic to which Optum must respond. UnitedHealthcare is an ideal market platform that executes well, quickly feeds back change to further innovate, a uniquely efficient and innovative [ph] real market dynamic.","No one in health benefits can offer Optum the scale that UnitedHealthcare does. In turn, UnitedHealthcare's growth of 2.6 million people over the past 2 years is both a product of Optum's distinctive services and a top line driver for Optum's results as well. And we make these capabilities and scale advantages available to others, not just for products branded UnitedHealthcare. Today we serve thousands of parties across the health system.","In the end, this complimentary alignment from health benefits to health services allows us to deploy capital and grow across a wider range of critical healthcare markets in virtually every geography and within a range of regulatory structures from heavily to lightly regulated businesses.","In summary, 2011 was a positive year for our businesses across many dimensions. But 2011 ended 3 weeks ago. For 2012, we are rededicating ourselves to fundamental execution. For us, that starts with serving others, a commitment to service excellence, managing healthcare costs, disciplined operating cost management, practical and productive innovation, developing and rotating leaders to strengthen our business platforms and the executives themselves, deepening external relationships and building new relationships and new business for 2013. These are the basic disciplines of our businesses. They have served us well, and we expect to continue to bore you with them. ","At this early stage, we continue to take an appropriately cautious posture on 2012 financial performance. Our fourth quarter results were above our expectations, but they do not alter our view of 2012. Initial growth results are basically in line with the plan we communicated at our November Investor Conference. We continue to plan to invest a total of nearly $400 million to the income statement for a form readiness and compliance and preparations to in-source PBM services. ","We expect steadily increasing medical system utilization over the course of the year. Commercial premium and government program reimbursements will continue to be under pressure in health benefits. And we have no assumption of reserve development. And if it were to occur in the commercial segment, it would be fully subject to rebate calculations.","We expect 2012 to challenge us to be at our best to achieve this plan, which targets net earnings per share in the range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share, with $6 billion to $6.4 billion in cash flows. You should be aware that first quarter presents a challenging year-over-year earnings comparison. Our plans include a sequentially lower first quarter than we've reported today for fourth quarter 2011. But as always, we are committed to delivering our best performance.","One of our investors recently observed that at the current rate, UnitedHealth Group's business will produce cash flows from operations over the next 5 years, totaling roughly 60% of our market cap. We intend to grow and to produce more than that, and we will continue to be thoughtful stewards of shareholder capital.","If we accomplish the goals we set out at Investor Day, we believe the company will become an even more valuable enterprise to our owners and our society. We are interested in your questions this morning. As usual, there will be one question per person so we can speak with as many of you as possible. I will turn this call back now to the moderator for your questions. And again, we thank you for joining us today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just ask about the moving parts in the quarter on medical trend. And in particular, the -- it looks like the -- that you had a significantly favorable variance on the public sector side, if we infer that correctly. Can you talk to that and how much was Medicare versus -- sorry, MA versus Medicaid versus PDP?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, Matt, as you can appreciate, we addressed more this on a broad basis for UnitedHealthcare but maybe, Dan, you want to respond to that?","Dan Schumacher","Good morning, Matt. This is Dan again. So first, in terms of the quarter, we are obviously very pleased with the performance, and I guess I would probably talk to it in terms of the medical loss ratio. Our loss ratio across UnitedHealthcare was up, but it was better than our expectation that we laid out at Investor Day. As you look at the commercial business, we saw an increase in our loss ratio, and that was largely due to less favorable development on a year-over-year basis plus also the incorporation of premium rebates under reform. And I think it's important to remember on the commercial side in particular, we had very low comparison periods in 2010, in the third and fourth quarter in particular. On the government side of the business, we saw a reduction in our loss ratio year-over-year, and that reduction was largely due to more favorable development on a year-over-year basis.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on the commercial trend, did that still come in at about 5.5% for 2011? And can you just give us the reference point for what it was for 2010?","Dan Schumacher","Our -- from a trend perspective, it came in generally where we had expected, at around 5.5%, and it was lower in 2010.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Credit Suisse.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'd love to get your view out of the big picture question that wasn't addressed very much by the Street generally or your investor, and this is on bundled payments for Medicare. It seems like there's been a tremendous amount of interest by the industry, and I'm just wondering how we should think about the impact to UnitedHealth Group of the adoption of bundled payments by Medicare. For example, in the Optum products that you sell that enable bundled payments and any pickup in demand you're seeing, but also what it means for your Medicare Advantage and potentially, your commercial business if providers do embrace bundled payments for Medicare.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes. So I think we think about this broadly in the category of kind of changing our approach to payments. So it's performance-based. It is basically any of the variations that we see that are different than a -- let's say, a fee-for-service approach, and we approach it and have been for some time in UnitedHealthcare in terms of how we have been driving performance-based relationships and contracts. And as you know over the last, probably the better part of 2 years, beginning to work with the delivery community in terms of enabling them to begin to ready themselves and engage in a way that they can effectively use these kind of payment methodologies in the conduct of their own business. But I'll start with Gail with respect to the UnitedHealthcare side, and then I might ask somebody from Optum to respond to how we're working on the delivery side.","Gail K. Boudreaux","Good morning, Charles. It's Gail Boudreaux. I think Steve hit it. As we think about bundled payments or all ways we're going to compensate physicians in the future and delivery systems, we're looking at a broad spectrum. And today, we have everything from fee-for-service to full capitation. We're experimenting with different bundled payments already in both our commercial and our Medicare business, and I think it's right now a bit early for us to comment on the full adoption of that, but we think it's going to -- 2 things are going to be really important. One, clinical integration in addition to the payment methodology is going to drive our performance in terms of bringing overall cost and quality. And at this stage, getting the bundles right, I think, is really important in aligning those bundles appropriately to the right incentives and our clinical programs. So those would be the 2 things, but we have a number of pilots in place already around bundles and it's a bit early, but encouraging.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The CBO suggested a 10% savings on a certain cardio-related procedure for bundled payments. Can you share any experience you've had with what percent savings you might expect on a unit cost from the adoption of bundles?","Gail K. Boudreaux","Charles, I think -- well, that was a very specific test run, and I think it's a bit early for us to be declaring savings. We think in cardiac and oncology, we're seeing some interesting results around oncology bundles. In particular, we rolled out a payment methodology there last year. Again, fairly early, but I don't know that we'd yet declare on what we think the total savings would be because it's not just about the bundles. I think it's about the integration to care, the incentives and the plan design. There's a whole number of other factors that come into play, and we see that both in our commercial business, as well as our Medicare Advantage business.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And I would expect that's going to run a wide range across the spectrum of service lines. So how about on the Optum side?","Larry C. Renfro","Charles, this is Larry Renfro. In general, I'd agree with everything that both Gail and Steve said. And we're, as you know, pursuing this in our delivery system. I might ask Dawn Owens to comment on this one more specifically.","Dawn M. Owens","Sure. If you think about the role that we've had with respect to bundled payments, there've really been 2 areas. One, in our specialty network solutions where there are categories of clinical care that are high cost, high variation and where we work with the care provider community already today to create bundled payments for those services, transplant is a really nice example of that, where it's a lot less about the unit cost but more about the total cost of care, alignment to quality, to protocols and so forth, where we deliver strong returns for patients and the system overall. Obviously, it's also a really important piece of the work we're doing in partnership with the delivery system in our Collaborative Care business, where we're taking total cost and total quality responsibility for the patient populations that we're serving. That's in Medicare, but also in commercial models as well. And so learning which models and which markets work most effectively in a skill set, there are a lot of factors and dynamics that come into play to create a successful model on that front.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I might just add by saying, broadly, what we see the benefit of a variety of different alternative payment approaches to the marketplace, and if we recognize that it is a widely ranging marketplace, as a result, these approaches are going to vary significantly. But over the course of time, we're committed to changing the way healthcare is paid. We do believe these approaches will be a better -- will produce better outcomes, better use of resources and will be better for healthcare, and we're going to be committed to doing our part along those lines.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just getting back to the MLR differences, I think we calculated them, what you call noncommercial all other, and acknowledged there's a lot in there. We had those up somewhere around 50 basis points for the first 3 quarters and then down almost 110 basis points. And that translates into almost $200 million of sort of change in cost. And I think Dan said earlier that, that was mostly due to changes in favorable development. So should we assume that the change in the noncommercial business was driven by a $200 million swing in development? And then any color on whether that was Medicare Advantage or Medicaid or even Med Sup or Part D would be helpful.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think Dan is going to kind of be restating what he said before, but I also don't think we're going to get into specific math in this kind of environment.","Dan Schumacher","Sure. Josh, it's Dan. We saw favorable development in all 3 of our UnitedHealthcare businesses in the fourth quarter and on the full year. In the fourth quarter of this year, it was more weighted towards our government programs. And in the fourth quarter of last year, it was more weighted towards our commercial businesses, and that's what I'd say with respect to kind of where it's falling along the business continuum inside UnitedHealthcare.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Maybe I can ask a different question, and I'm sorry. Can you talk a little about hospital unit pricing and contracting and any changes? A couple of your peers last quarter stated that they were seeing some change in of those trends. I'm just curious if you are seeing any differences in the actual unit cost on the hospital side.","Dan Schumacher","Josh, it's Dan again. On the unit cost side, it continues to be the most significant driver of our trend. So it's an area of intense pressure and intense focus for us as a business, and I would say that's been relatively consistent. And underneath that, the inpatient setting is the most pronounced.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But no change?","Dan Schumacher","No fundamental change. It continues to be a pressure point for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just in looking over your fully insured commercial enrollment for the last few years and then also taking into account the prepared remarks on your enrollment this year, do you think that the economy is having less of an impact on employer health benefit decisions than say a couple of years ago? So maybe said differently, as the economy -- is it perhaps improving and employers are not being as restrictive on their health benefit plans as perhaps they were back then?","Gail K. Boudreaux","So in terms of the economy, I don't think that the economy per se has had an impact on the restrictiveness of employers in their offering of benefits. What we are seeing, though, is employers are very focused around value-based benefit design, things that encourage health and wellness, trying to get real value out of the plans that they put in place. So we've seen significant interest in the narrow-network value-based offerings that we put in the market. As we look at our growth, particularly in the fully insured side, that's where we've seen a pretty significant uptick. Consumer-based health plans have done very well in this marketplace. Plans that have more consumer responsibility and transparency are selling really well. And I think employers want to see consumers engaged in health and getting value for it, as well as the money that they put in. So that's really the -- probably the bigger shift than employers fundamentally changing their perspective based on the economy.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Rex with JPMorgan.","John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just turning to Optum unit here. So back at Investor Day, you talked about a doubling of the ROC, I think, and from that unit over the next 5 years, so I think between now and 2015. And also kind of I think you've kind of repositioned that breaking it down into 8 different markets, and what I wanted to get is kind of a flavor, what you think about that growth trajectory. So I took those 8 markets that you were looking at, at Investor Day. Can you spike out -- so if I take it down the market segment and instead of kind of the way it's configured right now, can you spike out the 2 or 3 that would be the biggest contributors to that doubling?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Larry, you want to comment?","Larry C. Renfro","John, it's Larry. I'm going to start and then I'm going to have John in trends [ph], kind of pick this up and maybe go a little bit broader than the question that you asked. If you look at what we're trying to do from now until 2015, there's kind of 2 key areas of focus: one would be our fundamental execution; and second would be strengthening of our -- what I'd call strengthening and deepening our overall leadership team. And it will kind of all play to those 8 markets that I will let John get into in a second. But if you bear with me a minute, I think it's worth talking about this. If you look at the key indicators for us and what I think you ought to look at us in accomplishing over the next few years to 2015, there's really 4 areas you might look at as indicators: one would be organic growth, of which we had double-digit growth in 2011; two would be our development of health IT; three would be the development of clinical services; and four would be our PBM in-sourcing. So we believe we're in the right markets, and they are large and they're growing, and we believe that we are getting great market response. But those 4 key areas that I think from an indication standpoint from now until 2015, you want to pay some attention to. The key to our investments or return from the standpoint of acquisitions, I might take a moment and just give you an example, a model that we're following, and you can kind of take a look at that model and understand where we're kind of going. If you looked at OptumInsight and how we -- in 2009 and 2010, how we were really making significant investments and building out that platform. In 2011, we didn't do any acquisitions on purpose. We focused on integrating, and we focused on growth. The results from doing that, the top line growth is double digit, our margin has gone up 2% from 12% to 14%, and we expect that to continue from 2012 and beyond, so both the continued margin growth as well as the top line growth. So if you apply that same model across the OptumHealth and OptumRx, that's kind of the discipline that we're employing to really -- to get to that 2015. So I think you got to look at that model, but you can also look at the 4 areas that we need to focus on in terms of the improved fundamental execution. I don't know, John, do you have any comments?","John S. Penshorn","Got it. I think I'd just build on that, Larry. I think, as Larry mentioned, we -- of the 8 markets, we're in the right markets, they're large and they're growing. We're getting good market response for all of them. The key focus areas, as he mentioned, were the organic growth, health information technology, clinical services analytics and the PBM market. So I think we're in the right markets, and we're growing in those markets. And you got 2 effects: one, we're growing the top line and you already see that in the numbers across the board, which is 70% of our numbers year-over-year is actually organic growth, so you have a strong organic growth story. And then as we get to scale, you'll see the second piece, which is our margins expanding and I think you're going to see that in our different [ph] businesses, and I think Larry highlighted the story in OptumInsight, which is growing from 12% to 14% and we're expecting that to advance next year and get integrated to our long term guidance, which we've stated at Investor Day and continuing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I had a question on OptumRx. Specifically, I wanted to see if there was any update on the response that you've been getting from employers, any feedback they've been providing or any update on RFPs that you are looking at this year. And then going back to the prepared comments on revenue growth driven by higher-revenue specialty pharmaceuticals, if you could just speak to the size of the growth opportunity that you see there for the mid- and long term.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think we will broadly -- we don't -- we won't comment on customers or specifics along those lines, never have. But beyond that, I think we can respond more broadly, Dirk?","Dirk McMahon","Yes. So I think we have good relationships with consultants in the national account space. We're going to leverage those to continue to gain access to sales. We have a really good -- we're building our administrative platform and infrastructure. We think that'll improve our future competitiveness. We're working hard on our value proposition, which we talked about at Investor Day. It's all about improving total cost and quality by optimizing across medical and pharmacy. And we grew it out that last year.","Stephen J. Hemsley","2 million, right?","Dirk McMahon","We grew, yes, to 2.1 million members and 767,000 of those were external.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And then I think the response in terms of the marketplace is that there is an appetite for a new, more innovative competitor in that marketplace, and I think we're in the mix on all the RFP activity, right?","Dirk McMahon","Yes, we're definitely in the mix.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just on the specialty pharmaceutical growth opportunity for the mid and long term?","Dirk McMahon","Well, look, we -- I've read a bunch of stuff and we looked at some of the projections. We're -- probably 40% of the drug spend by 2014 across medical specialty, across medical and pharmacy benefits would be specialty drugs. We think we're well positioned for that market, specifically in the area of our clinical programs and our ability to handle and monitor the use of those drugs. So I think we're very well positioned to participate in the growth of the specialty market.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And we do all our own specialty. Larry, do you want to comment?","Larry C. Renfro","I just wanted to make an additional comment on what Dirk said earlier. When we began the year this year, we decided to put an announcement out of the Optum leadership team. And in putting that announcement out, one of the areas that -- and people that we wanted to bring over and to strengthen and deepen the organization was a person by name of Mike Matteo. Mike is the head of UHC's National Accounts, or he was the head of UHC's National Accounts prior to this move. He's moving into Optum to be the Chief Growth Officer. And Mike's background, he has tremendous relationships, both internally and externally. He's been experienced in business growth, business expansion, as well as executive sales leadership. And Mike is going to be working with OptumRx and Dirk's team to really put together a robust sales plan, and I just wanted to comment on Mike so that you would get his name. I don't know, Gail, if you have any thoughts on Mike?","Gail K. Boudreaux","No, thanks, Larry. I'd just add that we had a tremendous growth trajectory in our National Accounts business and I think Mike, from our perspective, brings that skill to the pharmacy business, and we think it will be a great addition to Larry's team. And we have a very strong bench, so it's a good move.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You talked about provider stewards and bundling in the narrow network products. A couple of questions there. Could you tell us how much of your membership on the commercial side is in these narrow network products and kind of your expectations there? And could you also put some meat on the bones in terms of your ability to steer volume to more efficient providers, so say X percent of our hospitals are considered high performance and they get Y percent of our volume or the same kind of metric on the doctor's side?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think we can respond to that. Gail?","Gail K. Boudreaux","Christine, let me take it in a few parts because I see a couple of different questions embedded in there. First in terms of the value-based products, less -- roughly 15%, a little bit less of our membership right now is in value-based type products, and that is an area that continues to grow, as I mentioned at the beginning of my comment. In terms of the -- I think your second question related to steerage to high-performing hospitals and physicians. Let me sort of step you back. We've had a premium designation in place for a number of years, and we originally began to introduce that to the marketplace in terms of just cost and quality and information and transparency. Over the last several years, we've began to build that into our basic design of our networks, whereas before it was -- it is still available to everyone, but we've also now embedded it in our networks. So that's part of that 15% members that come through that, but everyone has access to those premium designated physicians. In terms of our pay per performance on the hospital side, that's an area that's growing. And I think what I shared with you at Investor Day was that we are taking our premium increases and putting those into -- or rather our rate increases, and putting those into pay per performance. So that's how facilities earn a base rate and then they earn their incentive based on a very specific set of outcomes that we work with them on based on the facility but on a universe of probably 10 standard areas; for example, reduction of readmission rates, improvement in overall quality scores, things of that nature. From that perspective, the percentage there is roughly about 12% to 15% of spend would go through that model.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","If you think about how much these narrow network membership and the steerage is going to change, and presumably you're steering to the lower-cost, higher-quality and more-efficient providers and that lowers overall trend. If you think about all these factors together, is your hospital pricing in 2012 -- ignoring utilization because it's always a question what's going to happen there, but is your hospital pricing decelerating in 2012 relative to 2011? And what did it do in '11 versus '10?","Gail K. Boudreaux","Well, I think Dan addressed that when he talked about trends. There's still a significant pressure on unit cost at the hospital level. And year-over-year, that's one of the most significant issues in our trends, so that's one of the reasons we're trying to shift the overall distribution of unit cost to more pay per performance. But in 2011 and '12, when you look at the details of our trend buildup, unit cost at the inpatient hospital side is still significant.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So you expect the unit cost to increase on the hospital side and that drives the increase in 2012 medical trends?","Gail K. Boudreaux","We expect it to be stable year-over-year in terms of the percentage increase.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'd just comment one thing about the term steerage. I think it's important to recognize that the products that are really moving in the marketplace today are enabled. And one of the reasons I think they're getting traction is because they're enabled by much better information, they're enabled by much better, more personalized technology. And as a result, the consumers are actually in a position of making an assessment, being able to make a choice, so the -- it is less steerage. It is more about providing information, aligning incentives, and that works on both the consumer side and care providers side to make the marketplace more efficient. So I think that's -- that is why you're seeing that kind of performance across those products. You get great outcomes, you get high-quality access, and you get the opportunity to get in more control of your health and manage the economics because of the tools and the designs that are now in the marketplace. And I think that's fundamentally different than what I would call the historic notion of steerage.","Gail K. Boudreaux","The one thing that I'd add to this comment, as you know, we launched the treatment cost estimator tool. We showed that -- I think we shared that tool in Investor Day. It is now available to our members, and it does provide much greater transparency for consumers to take control of that decision and have a real understanding of cost and quality among providers and plans. And I think that is having a big impact in the market as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I can see the commercial MLR in the fourth quarter was better than you thought it would be back in November based on your full year guidance, but I\u2019d still like to explore the 190-basis-point increase year-over-year. If you could kind of comment on how much of that is tied to sort of medical trend versus pricing as opposed to how much is due to PPD last year. You said that there was more in the commercial side a year ago. And then how much is due to rebates this year? And also -- and perhaps most importantly from my perspective, how much is due to the sort of increase seasonality of the business from higher deductible health plans? And how will that change in 2012?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Touched them all, so, Dan, go through it.","Dan Schumacher","Peter, how about this, I'll rank them for you in terms of contribution to increase year-over-year. The first is stable to favorable development, so the change in that on a year-over-year basis. The second is the introduction of the premium rebates and then the balance is that relativity between yield and trend.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And what about seasonality in terms of the change from more people in higher deductible plans? That changes the seasonality of your costs from Q1 to Q4.","Dan Schumacher","Seasonality was pretty stable on a year-over-year basis. The challenge is you don't see it because the baseline was so low in 2010 when you compare it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with UBS.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the questions around Optum and that expectation of return on invested capital nearly doubling over the next 3 years. Just from a timing perspective, first, do you expect that to be fairly ratable between 2012 and 2015, or do you expect that to be more heavily weighted early on versus later or vice versa?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'll have Larry answer this, but I -- because it will tie into the elements of what he had just said, but my expectation is that it's -- it is going to be a steady acceleration, where we'll continue -- I mean the framework, and I think you should bear in mind, and I think the OptumInsight is a good example of it, is that we're building these businesses. And as we build them, they'd become more integrated, more mature, the expectation for margin expansion is established, the cost of building these becomes less and the profitability reveals itself. Larry?","Larry C. Renfro","Yes. I think I'm going to go back, and I'll probably be doing this many times over the next few quarters to those 4 elements. I think if we focus on or if you are looking at this from an organic growth standpoint, what we're doing in the developing of health IT and clinical services, as well as the program with our in-sourcing at the PBM, I think those are very strong elements for you to pay attention to. I think in addition to that, just so you know, that we're operating off of a 5-year plan. And so when we're walking through this, obviously there are changes that you have to make based on changes in the market. But I think we believe that we have a very strong start to 2012. We'll see a solid performance, but we'll be able to measure that. And then I would also go back to what we talk about with OptumInsight because that answers the questions around acquisitions. It's a model that we're going to have a strong, strong discipline around in terms of making sure that we have selected capabilities that we're looking at, and we kind of have a strategy of bill partner or invest, and we're going to have a strong, strong discipline around that. So I do believe this will give you line of sight into some of the things that we're doing. And we'll be developing this and talking about it over the next quarters.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And I think it's kind of important to recognize that I think this is principally around execution. We're in the right markets. The businesses are well positioned in those markets. We brought additional resources to bear, and this really is a function of execution, really, over the next couple of years, right?","Larry C. Renfro","Right.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on M&A, as you mentioned, the -- when I look over the last couple of years, you spent, if I include Excel Health, probably in the neighborhood of $5 billion or nearly 10% of your market cap on acquisitions. And there hasn't been a ton of visibility in terms of the levels of accretion or expected performance from an earnings benefit perspective. Is there any way you can help us flush that out given the significance there in terms of what that's going to add up from an earnings perspective over the next couple of years?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Justin, I don't know how to respond to that because we'd have to basically -- is begin the process of almost reviewing acquisition by acquisition with you. So I think we'll try to do that as we discuss these results. I would say that I think Excel will be more on the benefits side than it will be on the services side. But I think maybe the best way to do that would be to maybe discuss our kind of return on invested capital in more depth with you in the future settings. But we're really not prepared to discuss it today. I do think that the acquisitions that have been made have been very prominent in terms of the growth of the Optum businesses, and I would say that we're very pleased with all of the acquisitions that we made and I'll just leave it at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In the commercial business after you allocate for favorable development, can you talk about how the trend changed over the course of the year relative to the 5.5% trend for the full year? So basically what I'm trying to get at is as we exit 2011, are you at that 5.5% trend now, or do you think you're closer to the 6%, 6.5% trend that you're assuming for next -- for 2012?","Dan Schumacher","Carl, it's Dan Schumacher. The trend in the commercial business increased progressively through the quarters of the year, and it was more pronounced in the third and fourth quarters in particular because of that slow baseline in 2010. In terms of where we're operating at today, 5.5% is reasonable.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I think we perhaps only have time for maybe one question or so. So the next, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.","Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Steve, could you just talk a little bit about the duals, how you guys are thinking about that in terms of timing and potential investment around that and maybe just remind us sort of the states that most interest you and the ability to scale the capabilities you all have into those different markets, talking about the cave footprint, the steps, that kind of thing.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. I would suggest I'll have Gail, and then I think Dan will probably run through a couple of our other parties here today. I would suggest that this is not new for us. This is an area we have been focusing on for some time, even dating back to the Evercare business, the INSPIRIS business, et cetera. And so this has been a market segment that we recognize is in need of management, has significant cost, has significant challenges, so we've been building these capabilities for some time and already have a pretty good base of business. This is really just emerging in a more national profile, particularly from a policy point of view about just what the challenges really are to these businesses. So I think we're really well positioned in Excel Health, gives us a great position in that. In terms of -- you can come at this from 2 directions: the Medicare direction and the Medicaid direction. So we are somewhat indifferent and expected different approaches will be taken at different market. So that's why maybe -- Gail, if you want to pick it up from those 2 sides.","Gail K. Boudreaux","Sure, I think Steve hit the major points. One, as we mentioned at our Investor Conference and in our breakout sessions, we do see it as a major opportunity. We think we're uniquely positioned because we have significant presence in both the Medicaid and Medicare space. We've been at this business for a long time. We have experience in managing clinically complex and long-term care populations, and Excel brings some additional capabilities to us, which I think will be really important. And again, I think experience and the depth of experience that we have really matters in this market. Not a whole lot has changed since we met in New York in terms of the timing of what is happening. We are engaged. I might ask Jack Larsen who leads our Medicaid business to maybe comment a little bit about what we're seeing in this space in particular.","Jack Larsen","Hey, Doug, Jack Larsen. So I think Gail said it right, not much on the surface has changed in terms of having a different point of view on timing. CMS in a number of the 37 states who have submitted letters of intent are collaborating towards CMS's published goal of 1 million individuals and fully integrated programs by January of 2013. I guess still where we're at, we think all these states that have shown interest have interesting aspects where we could perhaps add value. We continue to work with states where we participate in the underlying Medicaid programs and offer dual special needs plans, as well as other states where we don't have but has developed presence and really trying to work with them as they develop their own unique approaches as to how they're going to get after that integrated Medicare and Medicaid cost structure, which is just an extraordinary opportunity I think I shared with you in New York in December. So...","Stephen J. Hemsley","Thank you. I think in terms of time, we are -- we need to close this. So again, we thank you for joining us on the call today. We hope what you heard is that our heads are totally into the game for 2012. We intend to serve people well. We intend to elevate our performance even further this year. And we will keep building and growing our businesses and our capabilities for both benefit and for services. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","Here's some important introductory information.","This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual result to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risk and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.","Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 16, 2014, which may be accessed from the investors page of the company's website.","[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Given that we provided a comprehensive review at our investor conference just over a month ago and that our 2013 fourth quarter and full year results were generally in line or ahead of that discussion, we'll keep our formal comments brief this morning and spend more time on to your questions and topics of interest.","We see 5 takeaways from this morning's discussion. 2013 was a very strong year, as we meaningfully advance the enterprise's capabilities, our growth and growth potential, diversification profile and market momentum. There are certainly near-term 2014 pressures, particularly from ACA implementation and Medicare funding actions that will divert more than $1.50 per share in earnings from us in 2014. But we have plans and actions in place to offset these reductions and to grow revenue to a range of $128 billion to $129 billion and produce earnings in the range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share, with cash flows from operations between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion.","In 2013, we deepened our capabilities and market relationships and successfully moved beyond significant undertakings, such as the OptumRx in-sourcing, the implementation of the large, long-term TRICARE contract and extensive ACA readiness and compliance efforts. We move into 2014 with operational readiness and performance levels stronger than ever before.","As Medicare Advantage underfunding is hurting seniors' benefits and causing disruptions to beneficiaries, our focus will remain on advocating for fair and consistent government funding to this program that now serves some 30% of this country's Medicare beneficiaries. In continuing to innovate, shape and improve our Medicare Advantage products and services to sustain these benefits can bring the best resources and service experience for American seniors.","We will continue to focus on delivering earnings per share growth in 2015 with our ultimate performance, dependent in part on the results of the Medicare Advantage rate-setting processes for 2015. And finally, while we will work intensively through the near-term pressures just discussed and covered comprehensively at our investor conference, we believe even more firmly that long-term, no organization has greater ability to serve and enable a more effective, modern healthcare system and respond to a national imperative to improve the performance at health care and reduce its cost from consumer benefits and well-being to care delivery and enabling technology.","UnitedHealth Group's long-term growth and earnings potential in this undertaking has never been more compelling than it is today.","To briefly review 2013. Full year revenues grew nearly $12 billion or 10.7% to $122.5 billion and net earnings grew 4% to $5.50 per share. Earnings were at the top end of the range we provided more than 1 year ago despite the subsequent imposition in sequestration, which cost approximately $250 million in operating earnings or $0.15 per share in 2013.","Cash flows from operations is $7 billion or more than 1.2x net income. Fourth quarter cash flows were $1.1 billion and we ended the year with more than $1 billion in non-regulated cash. We raised our dividend by 30% once again in 2013. It is now at a $1.12 per share annual rate. And we purchased nearly $3.2 billion of UnitedHealth Group shares in 2013. Return in equity for the year approached 18%.","UnitedHealthcare continued its extraordinary growth in 2013. We came to serve 4.5 million more people this past year entirely through organic growth, including more than 900,000 people in public and senior market benefit programs and nearly 400,000 people internationally. Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has grown by a remarkable 14 million people over just the past 4 years. Our benefit businesses are distinctively diversified locally, regionally and by product and customer type.","UnitedHealthcare earned $7.3 billion in 2013. UnitedHealthcare's operating cost were well-managed in 2013, as were medical costs, with commercial trends in the area of 5%. Hospital usage per capita was lower for the fifth consecutive year in 2013 and was lower across all our major benefit businesses.","UnitedHealthcare's results were negatively impacted by funding pressures and government-sponsored benefits, 3 calendar quarters of sequestration in Medicare and reduced levels of overall reserve development. Despite these pressures, UnitedHealth Care Group fourth quarter earnings 9% year-over-year to $1.8 billion.","UnitedHealthcare ended the year more aligned than ever, with key care provider partners. We have $28 billion in annual medical spending and 8 million members served under fee for value contract, including more than 2 million people under the most progressive of these performance arrangements.","We are intensely focused on expanding our integrated and accountable care leadership throughout 2014 and we have set an aggressive target of having more than $65 billion in value-based contracts with care providers by 2018.","Turning to Optum, our Health Services platform. Our focus on growth, simplification, integration and building larger and deeper relationships produced record revenues and operating earnings in 2013. Revenues grew 26% to $37 billion. Every reporting segment produced double-digit percentage revenue growth. As just one example of Optum's performance, our local care delivery business in OptumHealth increased both the number of payer partners and increased the number of people it served by 6% and it expanded operating margins more than 2 percentage points in 2013. Medical cost performance and patient satisfaction levels were excellent, with the overall trend held flat and our physician groups participating in health plan contracts with quality Star ratings ranging from no less than 3.5 up to 4.5 stars.","During the fourth quarter, Optum, QSSI was honored to be engaged and serve CMS in their efforts to enroll million of Americans to the federal and state exchanges. Great progress was made over the past 90 days and we are pleased to be a part of that effort. And we will stay involved in the senior advisory capacity as this project moves to its next phase of development.","For the year, Optum's operating earnings of $2.3 billion grew 61%, or $875 million over 2012, and are now up 84% over our 2011 baseline year. Fourth quarter 2013 operating earnings increased 43%. Optum reached its 6% operating margin target 2 years early in 2013 and now has established a new target called 8 by '16, which means an 8% operating margin by 2016.","As we enter 2014 with our company in a very positive position, we will continue to closely study the development of the individual public exchanges in 2014 and will be selective in our approaches for 2015. However, we expect to realize strong growth by serving several ways: as established Medicaid programs grow through the ACA expansion; as eligible Medicaid prospects were identified to the federal and state exchange market; and as the inevitable dual eligible MME initiatives begin to form in our implement.","The recent Tennessee Medicaid award for 2015, in which we earned the highest score among 7 qualified bidders, our 2015 renewal in Hawaii and the Michigan MME award, all reflect our strong capabilities and established relationships in the rapidly growing Medicaid market.","We have won 30 new RFPs or contract renewals in the past 4 years and we have grown organically by more than 1 million people served through our UnitedHealthcare community and state business over that period.","Continuing on 2014. Our initial Medicare growth is within our estimate, with balanced new membership growth and large employer wins during the year, offset by our exit from plans covering 150,000 people and the loss of over 90,000 seniors in 1 state account. Our Part D and Medicare Supplement offerings continue to grow well in the marketplace.","We continue to expect commercial group risk membership to be stable in 2014, with our commercial individual insured membership declining over the course of the year. And the number of consumers served in fee-based arrangements declining due to the loss of that large state account, as well as some migration to private exchanges for both retirees and active employees.","Our 2014 plan includes the collection of insurance fees and related taxes from state Medicaid customers. We have strong oral commitment from our customers that these were paid and we will record these revenues as written contract amendments are finalized over the course of the year. The timing of these final commitments could affect quarterly earnings progression.","UnitedHealthcare's earnings in the first quarter will also see year-over-year variances related to reserve development, capital gains and the effect of sequestration, which did not take effect until April 1, 2013.","Optum continues to build out its businesses around the themes of engaging consumers, aligning and optimizing care delivery, modernizing the health systems infrastructure and using data and analytics to make the health system more informed, aligned and effective. Optum expects strong top and bottom line growth in 2014, with operating earnings in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion and $45 billion to $46 billion in revenue. This performance will put earnings growth in the area of 25% and that growth rate includes, in both years, the earnings contributions from realigning our IT and global services businesses into Optum in 2014. This natural alignment will help us create and capture growth opportunities in business process outsourcing for health care and in healthcare IT assignments similar to our efforts in service to CMS.","Optum's earnings are expected to be strong in the second half of 2014, due to growth investments early in the year, such as fully implementing Optum360, as well as more traditional seasonal earnings pattern.","In the fourth quarter of this past year, both S&P and Moody's confirmed our corporate debt rating and upgraded their outlook. We ended the year with more than $1 billion in available cash and a ratio of debt to total capital below 35%. We continue to project cash flows from operations in a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion in 2014 and expect to return well more than $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend.","Standing back from the numbers, UnitedHealth Group is in a very strong position. We have posted consistent growth for several years, as measured by people served, revenues, contract backlog, cash flows, operating earnings, dollars under value-based contract and so on. We have leading positions in our market, but our market share is much lower than leaders typically have in more mature industries. We serve large and growing markets, so we have considerable organic growth opportunities for the future.","Our scale benefits the consumers, clients and customers we serve through innovation, cost advantages, efficient service and so on and this naturally engenders further growth. That model is expanding in care provider services and care delivery, with government agencies and national employers and with consumers and in Brazil, in Europe and beyond. Very large and sophisticated customers are seeking an enterprise-level partner, one with proven capabilities and the financial strength to help them navigate the changes that both consumers and government regulations are driving throughout the market, a partner like UnitedHealth Group.","In closing, I would simply once more shorthand each takeaways. 2013 was a very strong year in growth, achievement and capabilities and putting some big operational tasks behind us. 2014 will feel the impact of the ACA taxes and Medicare funding pressures, but we believe we can produce revenue growth and earnings in the $5.40 to $5.60 per share range. We suggest the quarterly earnings progressions need to better accommodate the first quarter and first half factors we discussed this morning.","And finally, in the longer term, we believe our prospects to grow and produce positive change across the health system for the benefit of all the system participants and our shareholders remain exceptional.","So thank you for your time this morning and we now would like to address your questions, discuss areas of interest to you today. So can we ask the moderator to take over and we'll respond to questions. Again, 1 per analyst, please, out of respect for the others in line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","You touched on Medicare headwinds for '15 in the prepared remarks and I wanted to better understand if that's a headwind compared to '14, so an incremental headwind in '15?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I don't think we were really suggesting anything other than we had said at the investor conference, that, obviously, there were rate actions taken related to 2014 that we believe significantly underfunded the program. And we had indicated there that we are -- continue to be watchful about the funding posture on the Medicare Advantage program. And we will continue to be watchful of that and continue to advocate strongly for consistence, reasoned funding of these program and continued commitment to American seniors who participate in them. I think we didn't really mean anything more than that.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","As I think about items to watch, there was that update in December of the 200-basis-point change in fee-for-service cost trend assumptions, so that kind of got us to a starting point of down 6% to 7%. And I think about some offsets to that. United has been very successful in medical cost savings through ACOs and risk-sharing contact with providers. So could you quantify what kind of trend vendor these efforts could create across the entire Medicare book?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I don't think we can. At kind of that distance, we think these programs are extremely effective and they're effective in terms of their cumulative effect. And we are intensely engaged on them across, basically, all of our benefit businesses, but certainly as they relate to government programs. In terms of the discussions that were held in December, we are not going to speculate, really, on what ultimate funding may come forward or change our position on that. We are going to be intensely engaged as that process goes forward. And as I've said before, we're going to continue to advocate strongly for strong and responsible funding to these programs. And I think we really can't speculate on a process that is really just not even really formally begun.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Steve, you highlighted some seasonality issues, both in Optum, investing in Optum360 and then some seasonality issues there, as well as some timing issues potentially with the health insurance fee. Could you help us think about some of these timing issues within both Optum and UnitedHealthcare and how they might impact progression of earnings relative to what we've seen historically? I know you talked about first quarter, those 3 factors. But any help you could give us would be appreciated.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, I think -- well, I think the general theme is to be -- I'm going to hand these off because they do really touch different parts of our business. And I'll probably ask John Rex to speak to some of the front end on Optum and then in terms of the Medicaid activities, Steve and Dan. But I think the -- we're obviously suggesting that you relook at the progressions in terms of, again, I'll say the first half versus the second half of the year, given the timing of when these Medicaid contracts will actually fall in informal terms and the patterns of the Optum business, both in its new business and its traditional seasonality. But John, you want to start up?","John Rex","Yes. So when I think about Optum in 2014, so we'd expect a pattern, first half, second half pattern of roughly 40%, 60% in terms of earnings progression for the year. Now if you think about 2013, we're roughly 40%, 45% in the first half. So the impact there, you're seeing some of the impact of the investments we're making in these larger, more comprehensive relationship that we've talked about and that would be an impact that you'd see, particularly as you look across the Insight and the OptumHealth businesses.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Things like Optum360.","John Rex","And Optum360, in particular. The one that we talk about most.","Stephen J. Hemsley","And then, Steve, you want to talk about Medicaid?","Steve Nelson","Christine, it's Steve Nelson. We have -- as you've heard me say before, we have a year-round process we're engaging based on rates and we call this rate advocacy and especially from the competency of our business. But the fees and tax impact has been a part of that. We consider a part of our cost. As we sit here today, the states have over -- or I'd say, overwhelming majority of our states have agreed to reimburse us for both the fee and the tax impact. Actually, those fees have technically said no to us. We are continuing to be engaged with them in a productive and, I think, thoughtful discussion. So it's more work to do, but the progress is really significant and our outlook is positive. In terms of how we recognize the revenue, Dan, do you want to comment on that?","Daniel Schumacher","Sure. Christine, on the revenue recognition side, as Steve mentioned, the overwhelming majority, we've got commitments. With respect to revenue recognition, we'll be relying on written commitments. We have a very good share in hand today, but still have some more to get and will make progress over the course of the first quarter and throughout the year and that will influence the timing of the revenue recognition.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you elaborate on what portion, maybe you're not comfortable but if you are, what portion you have written commitments on the health insurance fee to get all of it recovered? And are they filling in efficiency adjustments below the line by telling you that you're getting the health insurance fee, but then saying you're going to get all these new memberships so maybe we don't need to you as much? Or are they recognizing the pent-up demand?","Daniel Schumacher","You fit a couple in there. With respect to the insurance fee specifically, the majority of our states are looking to do a lump sum true-up once the fee is actually known. So we'd expect to get it in the September timeframe from a reimbursement standpoint. And in terms of how many we have in hand from a written commitment, we have less than half but more than 1\/3. So we're making strong progress and we've got -- we expect in the next week and the coming weeks to be more of that, as well as for the second quarter. Your other question around pent-up demand, that was more, I think, aimed at the expansion population in the newest health members into those markets. We do have an expectation of higher views related to those new members and we have, in the vast majority of our states, a separate rate sell that does account for and reflect a higher initial use pattern. We'd expect that, obviously, to moderate over time as our clinical programs take hold.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Lake with JP Morgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Medicare Advantage. It sounded like you said you're seeing membership on track versus your expectations. Wondering if we can get a little bit more color here in terms of what you're seeing in open enrollments, specifically maybe talking through some of the impact from changes to your physician network and on member attrition. Because of this, maybe are you seeing any selection issues happening here in terms of bigger members leading more significantly than others, et cetera?","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'll have Jack respond to this. And I'm sure he will hit this point, too. But we would remind you that we start out the year 250,000 or so down, given the market exits we took and the single contract that we lost. So Jack, do you want to pick up on that?","Jack Larsen","Sure, Justin. Jack Larsen. Maybe before I tackle the multipart question here on the 2014, let me go back and remind you about 2013 and the very strong growth year we had there, almost 1 million members, with something around 425,000 in Medicare Advantage alone. With respect to the 2014 AEP performance, let me take the growth part first. I'd say we were on our plan in all of our major product lines, Med Stop, Part D, MMA. I think for individual Medicare Advantage, we took a little bit of a different approach this year and really aimed at preserving and, in fact, growing our share in markets that we would consider to be long-term, financially stable, viable markets for us. And in these particular markets, we have really strong growth and we have retention, member retention, that was actually improved over what we had seen in prior years. And I would say in some other markets, we made a decision that we were going to seed some share to others. And in those markets, where we pay some benefit decisions, we saw retention slightly less than historical levels, as well as the rate of production and new business. And I think, as Steve referred to, you hit it right out. We started with about 150,000 people affected by market withdrawals. Now on the group side, we, I think, chatted at the investor conference about the loss of a large state-based contract of about 90,000 people, effective 1\/1. And you're seeing those numbers in the recently posted CMS result. That will be offset effective February 1 through the win of a large state account in, roughly, the 90,000 member range. So all-in, I'd say, we're right where we thought we would be this AEP and feel pretty good about our plus or minus 50,000 member growth that we shared with you at the investor conference. In terms of mix, it's just way too early. I don't think we're seeing anything that surprises us. But we're doing that analysis now. We need to see a little more information on our inbound members from CMS. And I think we'll have a better point of view the next time we speak in the [indiscernible].","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jack, maybe just in terms of any comments on the impact due to enrollment of some of these physician -- from the physician network changes? And maybe talk a little about what benefit that's going to give you in terms of quality improvements and cost going into 2015? And then, just lastly, on those markets that you did decide to take a step back on, would it be fair to say -- should we think that the market should be concerned that you put -- that the members that are being put back into the market or that you're exiting are significantly different in terms of morbidity or risk versus those in the existing book and then maybe there could be some selection issues in the market broader?","Jack Larsen","Yes. So as I said earlier, we did see levels of attrition a little higher in those markets that we chose to seed some shares. Some of those markets are aware we are taking our network optimization, network restructuring kind of work. And it's also -- it's geography, but it's also products as well. So we differentiated between HMO products and PPO products. I think in terms of just what we are trying to accomplish in our network activities, there's just a ton of pressure all over the system. Steve referred to it and we talked about it at the investor conference. And I think that rate pricing pressures probably most defeat Medicare. The system's fragmented. Clearly, it has rising cost. And I think everyone agrees it's got the opportunity for demonstrably better outcomes. I think what we're -- the themes we see and really what the Affordable Care Act is telling us is law and CMS is suggesting us through regulations, is that the industry has to change and we have to change. We have to be more integrated. We need to be more aligned. We need to have a provider network that is aligned with us better, both in terms of data and financially. And we need to do all of that with far less resources. And I think these are the themes that we're responding to. This is what you are seeing us and others do in the marketplace with respect to reaching out and making affirmative changes in our network. So we're really evolving to meet the requirements of a Medicare program that's going to be successful in the future. So while it's going to be a little noisy and a little turbulent, we acknowledge that. I think we're conforming our business in the right way to be successful in the Medicare program in the future.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Gail, do you want to comment?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Justin, it's Gail Boudreaux. In addition to what Jack just said about network, I think it's important to think about that this activity across network is going on across all the benefits space. And Jack referenced some of just the incredible pressure in the system around rising costs, connectivity and, quite frankly, getting better outcome. But in addition to just the shaping of the network to meet the unique populations in Medicare, we're also very focused, as you know, on increasing our pay-for-performance across Medicare. We talked about that a little bit at our investor conference, moving that up dramatically over the next few years. Greater clinical integration. And it's all to drive better outcomes. And again, those who respond to CMS' desire to have greater primary care centric networks and better outcome, that's happening across all of the benefits businesses and it's really important about -- as we think about modernizing the health care system. So what we're trying to do there, I think, is evident in Medicare, but it's also evident in our other business. And our support is provide better data and allow these physicians to better and more effectively manage these patients.","Operator","We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think I just might switch gears and ask you about the Optum and the experience with QSSI. Obviously, in the last 2 months, you guys have gotten a lot of kudos for how that's worked out. Can you comment on maybe your thoughts on the business implications of the way that's played out? Has that opened up other contracting opportunities with the federal government, outside the federal government and beyond? And give us some flavor for that, if you would.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. Obviously, I think as you're suggesting, that it's had a very positive reputational effect. But Larry, if you're on the line, do you want to start this and then maybe Andy Slavitt comment as well?","Larry C. Renfro","Sure. A.J., I think you probably know this, so let me give you a little history here. When we started the project prior to October 26 -- and I'll just use that date -- we were a contractor that built the data services hub, as well as the registration process, something called the IDN. And then we controlled all the testing. When we got brought in on October 26 to work on fixing the site, we got, obviously, to work with CMS and HHS. And they did a great job of kind of outlining everything to us so that we kind of understood where we were at. And that's why we became the general contractor. And coming to general contractor, we were operating under, what I would call an urgent timeframe for about 60 days to get things accomplished. And then we were able to get through that, learn a lot and it's now in, what I'll call a more normalized environment. And we -- we have just become, as I'm sure you read, a senior adviser. And I'll have Andy talk about that in a second. But what I would say is we obviously learned a lot in terms of working with the federal government and being a part of the whole process. I would tell you that we are also working with a lot of the state. And I think that when we were at our investor conference, we talked about we were moving over on the UHG IT side, what we do with our technology infrastructure and so forth. So we believe that's going to tie in nicely to what we did for the government to be able to offer candidly around the industry. So it's going to expand what we do. So we appreciate what we were able to accomplish and what we've learned, but we believe we're just kind of starting. Andy, you got anything else?","Andrew M. Slavitt","Yes, just had a couple of quick thoughts. First of all, this is -- some of this is repetitive of what Steve and Larry covered. Clearly, this was a job done principally by CMS with the help of a lot of contractors. We were glad to be and continue to be glad to be involved. I think in terms of implications, I'll just point the 3 things. First is we try to build our reputation on big complex problems that we can solve for clients in health care and, hopefully, more clients will have an opportunity to see Optum in action and that's a good thing. Second, as Steve mentioned in his opening remarks and Larry just hit on it, we can bring technology outsourcing to this industry in a way that we think is unique to health care. And so we think there's opportunity both in and out of the government for us to do that. And the third, there are situations very much like this around the country and state-based exchanges, where some level of business problem-solving, prioritization and leadership will be called for. And we're happy we were able to jump into those situations as well.","Stephen J. Hemsley","I'll just finish by reinforcing the fact that we were pleased to be part of that. That was a broad team effort. There were significant efforts and progress made in terms of the participation from CMS, their leadership and their staff. And all of the partners, the outside suppliers around that, everybody pulled together in an extraordinary way to do that, the only way that could have been accomplished. And so, really, the credit really should be spread broadly.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to Medicaid quickly. Understand the comments about the lump sum true-up and that most states or all states have, essentially, verbally agreed to maybe the true-up for the fee. But from a GAAP earnings perspective, does -- can you just help us understand whether you can, on a GAAP basis, just assume you're going to get it in the first quarter and second quarter, if you haven't actually received anything in writing? Or just generally, how the fee might impact EPS on a quarterly basis?","Daniel Schumacher","Chris, it's Dan Schumacher again. With respect to recognition, obviously, the expense associated with the tax will be incurred in each month across the year. On the revenue recognition, we will rely on written communication. And where we have those, we'll be booking revenue in each of the respective quarters. And where we don't, we'll be weighting what we do. Even though you mentioned lump sum, they may pay in lump sum, but you will recognize appropriate matching once you get a contract.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Correct.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","But so, in theory, this could create a -- if you don't have something inked, at least early in the year, it could create a bit of a headwind in the first, second quarters of '14, is that correct?","Stephen J. Hemsley","That's why we mentioned it. It's exactly why we mentioned it.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to go back to the commentary around 2015. Obviously, appreciate that it's a little bit early to be talking about it. But with all indications that the 2015 MA rate may be as bad, if not worse, than the 2014 we've seen proposed, can you just give us a sense of what within your business might be doing better in 2015 than 2014? I mean, I just try to -- struggle with the concept. I think you started off by saying you expect growth in 2015 but the impact will really be determined by the final MA rate. So I just want to see if the rate is as bad in 2015 as it is in 2014, what operational levers within MA or outside of MA can you see at this point that might help you show a growth rate better than what you're showing in 2014?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, again, we're not going to speculate on where the funding activity will ultimately play out. We have a very broad and diverse business. We are intensely focused on improving our performance across the board. As you can see, the performance that has been achieved in -- broadly in several areas across UnitedHealthcare. The sense of growth in Medicaid to the very strong performance that we had in the commercial business this past year and the opportunities internationally. And then the opportunities for Optum, I think, are impressive and they have established a track record of performance. And we are intensely focused on our cost and the continued improvement of our businesses. So I would think that they would be all the traditional kinds of things that one would be pursuing. And we are pursuing them, I think, with significant intensity. I just think that in January, off of the strength of a phone call conversation in December with CMS, that we should necessarily take undue direction from that and that we will see how this process proceeds. And as I've said before, I think that there is a broader sense of responsibility to American seniors than to have underfunded the program, by our measures, about 6.7% last year. And if there is speculation that there would be underfunding at that level again in this year, that would be almost a 13% pullback on Medicare Advantage over the course of 2 years. And we would think that, that would be extraordinarily disruptive. It remains to be seen.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate the commentary about the underfunding, it does seem to be a significant cutover a couple of years. But and also, it's very difficult to propose -- or to forecast what's going to come out of CMS at any point of time. But when the rate hits, we have to interpret that the day it happens. And everything that you've outlined to me sounds like things, to your point, that you've been working on for 2014 and you're seeing benefits from them in 2014. I guess the question is, if we see something similar from MA in 2015, if you'd do the same things to offset it in 2015. There is a reason for acceleration outside of the MA business -- or is there, I guess, is my question.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Well, I think that we have probably more areas to accelerate and to grow and build on than perhaps anyone else in the space. And then we would take the steps necessary with respect to benefit adjustments, market considerations, network actions, premium actions, cost and distribution cost. So there's a broad repertoire of actions that we are taking and the question really comes down to the intensity of those. And that's where we get down to disruption.","Operator","We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's obviously still early in the year. But the issues around the roll-out persist. Over time, obviously, you would think that things would start to work themselves out. But just given the timeline of bids due just in the next kind of few months. I guess, what are your thoughts on playing in the exchange in 2015? Should we expect a similar approach and maybe more limited activity? Or have you seen enough where we should start to expect you to be a sort of a more active participant? And then maybe just how much, if at all, is the '15 MA outlook just sort of influential on that decision or not? Or is that sort of something that's kind of mutually exclusive?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. So Gail and Jeff, do you want to start?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Sure. Well, Ralph, first of all, in terms of the public exchanges, I think you know that we've got a very modest footprint. And as I shared at Investor Day, our decisions around 2015, our participation will really be very much reliant on how this market matures. So at this stage, we're really not projecting our participation. We will be looking at sort of the -- how robust the enrollment is, what the risks in those markets are and the consumers participating and, quite frankly, the cost structure is on those markets. So at this stage, I don't know that we have any additional guidance to give you from what we shared at the investor conference, but that's our outlook.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Would you expect to have that, though, just in the next kind of few months? I mean, I'm sure there'll be some level of incremental.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Again, it's a maturing marketplace. It's really early. It's just rolled out. We'll be looking at a market-by-market basis. So we're not going to give guidance around our participation at this stage, but we're going to watch the markets mature. And we'll get more information and we'll be sharing that with you as it becomes known to us. In terms of your second question on Medicare and does that influence our exchange participation, I would say, no, it doesn't. We're going to look at -- we look at each of our markets very specifically and look at the dynamics in those markets. So we will take a very focused look at exchanges. And as you heard from Steve, we'll also look market-to-market in Medicaid -- Medicare just as we did this year.","Jeff Alter","Generally, our view on '15 is that we are not dependent on exchanges.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","Right.","Jeff Alter","I mean, we will take this in a measured way.","Operator","We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Now my question, though, I'm sensing some sensitivity among investors and, indeed, some of this is on my end. Perhaps I don't understand exactly what kind of pricing decisions you made for 2014 with respect to your estimates of cost trend and a recoupment of the fees through higher premiums where possible. There's a sense out there that, that trend is kind of tied to premium right now and that perhaps, if the fees are 100 to 200 basis points, there's only 80 basis points or so of wiggle room. That was one statistics suggested to me. So I'm wondering if you can comment on that and give us some comfort or some indication of what's happening there, especially with respect to a trigger here, that's the medical cost ratios have been a tad high in the fourth quarter and I'm wondering if that's anything that might be indicative of the pricing versus cost trend in '13 and then in '14, anything in the conversation as we speak.","Stephen J. Hemsley","So we'll have Jeff kind of speak to that pricing discussion. And if we have not get fully your question, then we'd clarify it on the end. So Jeff, do you want to start?","Jeff Alter","Sheryl, it's Jeff Alter. So I think the market test and their surveys are correct. Our pricing in 2014 is stronger than it was in 2013. And you mentioned it, a part of the reason that it's stronger is because of the ACA fees, taxes, as well as the essential health benefits across all markets. And then when you look at small group and individual, the move to community rating, depending on which part of that marketplace you're looking at, you could see some much stronger pricing. Your suggestion around cost trend versus pricing, just a couple of things to think of. One, we have not changed the discipline of pricing that has gotten us -- has been successful for us for a very long time. We look at our forward cost, which now include, as I mentioned, some impacts due to the ACA. But we're certainly as focused on medical trends as we had ever been in the prediction of medical trend. The medical trend for pricing was about a point higher in '14 than it was for '13 and we match our premium to that. Again, I know it's been a few years, but we'll go back to the MLR. We manage this across hundreds of intersections, so that we try to stay as close to that rebate line as possible. So depending on which market you're looking at or studying, we may have rebates that are still to be paid in that marketplace. And we're continuing a long how to adjust to that very tight band around that MLR. And in other markets, we have the ability to price a little bit stronger. So that is all in that calculus that creates our forward pricing as we move forward. And now, more than ever, impacts for the ACA are also included in there.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Good discipline, well-aligned with medical cost trends and, really, not particularly significant changes in the marketplace. We're competitive, but we think we are pricing well.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Right. And the MLR performance in the fourth quarter, were you comfortable with that?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes.","Daniel Schumacher","Sheryl, this is Dan. From a fourth quarter standpoint, as we look at that, medical costs were well controlled. If we look at the implications on both loss ratio and trend, they were very much in keeping with our expectation from Investor Day and set the stage for the right jumping off point into 2014.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just ask on the commercial enrollment and what you're seeing from employers as sort of 2-part question. Number one, are you seeing anything significant in terms of employee uptake of coverage now that there's this broad awareness of the individual mandates? Some employers, evidently, are seeing that in some cases, I gather, as significant. And somewhat related to that, just curious on comments on the commercial risk enrollment results for the fourth quarter. Just those were stronger than we expected. I just wonder if you could remind us if there was a special factor there.","Jeff Alter","Sure, Matt, it's Jeff Alter. I guess, on your first question, it's sort of hard to tell. I think that would probably most happen in our largest clients. And it takes a little bit past 1\/1 to make sure that all those enrollment files are correct. And so we usually feel better about commenting on sort of the National Account growth or growth in existing accounts by the time we get to February, it's a little too early to talk about that. We do see interest for some employers to create a different benefit construct that could allow for growth. But we haven't seen those results come through yet in our 1\/1 enrollment. Talking about our fourth quarter '13, I think there were a few things that were driving that. There was a fairly large push in our individual business to sign up as many enrollees as possible early so that we can give that advantage of an additional year without the ACA impact. And that program was an aggressive program and it was very successful. And then we had mentioned probably throughout '13 that there was interest in our small group clients for alternative plan years for them to be able to keep their benefits for that additional year even prior to the president's announcement. So that did drive some, I'll call it one-time growth in the fourth quarter of '13.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just so I could understand, because I'm a little confused about it. I would think that those dynamics would make you feel more secure about retention at the small group and individual level but not necessarily explain growth if you're doing early renewals with your current account base. Was there an element to this that also drove some growth?","Jeff Alter","Yes. So in some markets, the value proposition that we put into the market was not matched by some competitors. And so we were able to take some share. And then you're right, it did help attrition. It also helped the sort of retention of groups that might have left anyway. So when you think of a small group attrition rate of somewhere in that 15% to 20%, those groups that were renewing in that fourth quarter, there was a higher attrition rate -- a better retention rate.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And sorry, just last thing on this. Wouldn't this make you maybe feel a little bit better about the guidance on individual, not that it necessarily moves the needle much, but given what you saw towards year-end?","Jeff Alter","We're not -- at this point, we're not changing our guidance for '14. There's a lot to play out.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can we talk about OptumRx for a minute and in terms of the growth you expect in 2014 and 2015, probably from outside clients. But also I want to understand how the rule changes that came out on preferred networks will impact you, whether there's integration savings -- integration expenses that you'll save, that you won't have to do next year. And then, from the early marketing window, what are you seeing in terms of how it's starting to look for 2015 and then the potential for your specialty trend to help you win business?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Okay, 3. Okay, so let's start with growth. I think we had a nice momentum coming out of 2013. Our value prop continues to resonate in the marketplace. If you look at '14 sort of excluding our last wave of the migration, we'll probably grow north of 1.5 million next year. Based on what we sold on 1\/1, we'd be confident in that number. As it relates to CMS, I'd like to comment more broadly, I think. What we'd like to see from the CMS proposal, any CMS proposal, is -- and the rule-making is the ability to continue to incent the efficient mail channel and manage preferred networks consistent with historical practices. We believe both those things are really good for the beneficiary and good for the Medicare program. Last thing, specialty trend, I would say a couple of things. I think we continue to have a good advantage with our ability to manage not only the specialty benefit but then -- the specialty spend within the medical benefit but also in our formulary. I think that's a good thing that we've historically done and our trend has reflected that over time. I think that got all your question, does it not?","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just integration expenses and then you bringing in the cost from doing the big integration that you've done this year or bringing that PBM in house, is there some substantial savings that we should be expecting going forward?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, we did recognize that savings. As I talked about at the Investor Day, there's -- we're not changing our guidance for next year. The avoidance of those expenses in 2014 compared to '13 definitely provided us with earnings lift in 2014.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And nothing incremental for 2015?","Stephen J. Hemsley","It's already in our numbers.","Andrew M. Slavitt","Yes, I would say that it's already in our numbers.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Do you think the changes, the rule changes, if they happen as they are proposed will hurt your competitors more than they will hurt you in terms of preferred networks?","Stephen J. Hemsley","You know what, I can't really speak to what I think about that right now. We'll hold off. We're sort of in the rule-making phase as we speak right now. We got to let the full rule play out. We'll give our comments during the comment period as will our competitors. We'll be able to speak more deeply about this as the year progresses, when we get a specific visibility into what the rules are.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up just on the commercial pricing and cost trends and would be interested if you can maybe drill in just comparing small group and large group for your expectations for 2014. So with the expected 100 bp increase in cost trend, how does that compare between small group and large group? And then maybe just an update on sort of the pricing environment in small group versus large group and whether you're seeing any variance there?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Jeff?","Jeff Alter","Sure. So we're not going to get into that level of detail in a call like this. I would say the -- just to comment around small group pricing, this is a transitional year for many markets. We're moving out of medically underwritten to community ratings. So I think on a call like this, in a summary discussion, it's hard to discuss small group versus large group when you have such a transition going on in small group as we move to that community rating formula.","Daniel Schumacher","Yes. And Scott, this is Dan Schumacher. I would just add that, obviously, in small group, there's a lot more variability than there is in large group because small group's going through the transition to adjust to community rating. And based on your health status previously, there's more variation in the price differential at the group level in the market than there is at the large group, which is always okay. I don't think there's any really new change in the marketplace.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux","This is Gail. I would just add to Jeff and Dan's comments to the tone of your question, which is that the small group market has remained pretty consistent, with the exception of the change in community rating. The market competitiveness is relatively the same as we commented the last few quarters.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question just broadly about M&A. 2013 was very quiet by United's standards. The deployment of capital for acquisitions is $300 million or so. So I'm curious, is there something in the environment do you think that the level of uncertainty around reform has created a bigger divide between buyers and sellers? Or is there something else going on there? And maybe, I know you guys have talked specifically around a pipeline, per se, for M&A. But with things you're looking at, would you consider it to be similar to what we're seeing in '13? Or do you think there's going to be more opportunity going forward?","Stephen J. Hemsley","Maybe we'll comment very broadly, but we generally don't like to comment on what our view of the potential expansion marketplace is or what our interest might be or are, because we consider that to be somewhat competitive and strategic. I'd just offer broadly that often, the biggest impediment is valuation and whether we feel comfortable with how the market is valued across a particular set of asset or asset classes. Do you have any comment, Dave?","David S. Wichmann","Josh, I think I'd just also remind you that we were coming off of the -- at least for us, we were coming off of the Amil acquisition, which was quite substantive the fourth quarter of last year. And what shows up more as a financing activity as opposed to an investing activity is the tender that we did for Amil's public shares, that's about 1.5 billion as well. So it was roughly about 1.8 billion or so allocated to M&A type activity. And lastly, I'll just say, to reiterate the thing at our investor conference, we are clearly a -- an M&A company and our interests in M&A continue. Our agenda is virtually the same, which is really around building these capabilities, geographic market presence. But possibly, a slight bias more towards Optum in the international markets, which we think are fast-growing and expansive markets. But we'd also look to -- for opportunities to leverage our scale broadly in our business.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just thinking about Medicaid. Clearly, you don't break out Medicaid MCRs. But at a high level, how should we think about the cost for the business, maybe excluding the industry fee, reflecting kind of the growth and mix that you'll be staying including long-term care duals, the expansion of re-procurement. How big an impact mix had on MCR? And would any changes be temporary once you get these people into your care management programs, or should there be a long shift upward in the MCRs for that product?","Stephen J. Hemsley","We don't comment -- maybe Steve can make a few comments on this. But in general, we really don't get into margin discussions at that level of depth. We have historically suggested that the range of margin for those businesses in the 3% to 5%, 3% to 6% level, depending upon the performance of the business in a particular year. And that mix, ultimately, even if one offering were to be particularly strong, it tends to generally, ultimately come down into that general range of 3% to 5% for that kind of business. And we're really not changing our perspective on that. And I think that's well aligned with the marketplace. That said, Steve, do you have anything to offer?","Steve Nelson","Stephen, I think those are good comments. I would just say generally, they -- the opportunities to grow in Medicaid are robust and they include a variety of populations. For example, more complex populations, the expansion population has different utilization characteristics, at least the first, as Dan mentioned. And as we engage with them and are -- both the complex population and expansion population, engage with them our distinctive clinical models and our pride of capabilities that we have, I think, a really strong track record, we'll be able to bring a lot of value to our state partners and good outcomes to these populations. So it's part of our business. It's part of the growth opportunity. And we're actually -- really like our position and our opportunities in the space. And just to expand on Steve's earlier comments in the beginning, really strong track record in competing successfully for this business with that.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Yes, it's a very localized business, local programs. So these margins run their range from year-to-year across that -- those geographies. And given our scale, we aspire to the higher ends of those margins. But we will run the range of those margins across our markets over time. So it is a business with a great deal of variation market to market.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","On specialty drugs, I'm hoping to get the sense of magnitude. Do the hep C drugs have the potential to make a meaningful impact on the trend in specialty? And from a rate advocacy standpoint, are you having discussions with the states, as I understand, a lot of this may hit Medicaid, are you having discussions with the states about them potentially backstopping you in some way on the cost of drug life stability?","Stephen J. Hemsley","So Dirk, do you want to comment in general. And then I think that sounds to me more like a Medicaid question than a drug question. But maybe you want to talk about the specialty additions.","Dirk McMahon","Yes, well, just hep C in general, I think -- we know that new therapies have recently been launched. The competition is valuable for our strategy at state. Like any other drugs, we compare the efficacy versus the cost of these drugs. And when we look at those, we'll decide where to place them from a tier perspective. We would, of course, steer utilization from a tier strategy standpoint to those that produce the most effective and most efficient outcome. So we're really about trying to manage the overall drug\/medical spend as we sort of take our approach to pharmacy management, I think hep C is similar. And as far as where they are in the trend, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen J. Hemsley","Sure. So from -- we do expect higher utilization of these drugs in 2014. We did see that in 2012 as well when we had the new introductions that came in mid 2011. But that's obviously something that's part of our forward outlook. It's contemplated in our pricing. In terms of the implications on our trend, we are talking basis point, not points, and it's fully reflected in our forward outlook. With respect to Medicaid specifically, just as the insurers' fee and other elements are components of cost, it is an element that goes into our build-up. It's an active part of our dialogue to the extent that we're covering pharmacy benefits in a state and it will be part of our beta process that Steve Nelson talked about.","So thank you. I would say that, that will conclude our comments today. We remain intensely focused on the challenges and the opportunities of 2014 and 2015. And we thank you for joining us and thank you for your continued interest in our enterprise. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day."]}}
