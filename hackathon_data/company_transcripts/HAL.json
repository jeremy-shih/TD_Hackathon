At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Thank you, Sam. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is available on Halliburton website.","Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Jeff Miller, COO; and Mark McCollum, CFO. Tim Probert, President of Strategy and Corporate Development will also be available today for follow-up calls.","I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, and recent current reports on Form 8-K.","Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the fourth quarter results, which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website.","Our third quarter 2012 results included a $48 million charge, which amounts to $30 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share, for an acquisition-related earn-out adjustment. This charge is reflected in both our North America and Latin America Completion and Production segment results.","Additionally, in the third quarter, we recorded a $20 million gain, which amounts to $13 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, related to a patent infringement settlement that is reflected in our corporate and other expense. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items on our financial results.","We welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?","David Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2012. First, I'm proud to say that we delivered industry leading revenue growth in 2012 on the strength of our international business.","Our international operations also delivered industry leading profit growth. The result is a record year for our company with revenue totaling $28.5 billion, despite the challenges we experienced in the North America market.","To put this in perspective, our business has nearly doubled in size over the last three years, nearly all of it from organic growth. We set new revenue records this year in all of our regions and in both of our divisions. From an operating income perspective, we achieved new records in our Latin America region and in five of our 12 product lines.","At the start of each year, I find it's important to reiterate our basic strategy. Our cornerstones remain unchanged. Leadership in global unconventional development expanding our share within the deepwater markets and helping our customers maximize recovery from mature fields.","As the industry leader in unconventional development, this year we elevated our service offerings with the start of the rollout of our Frac of the Future initiative. This provides the most efficient and effective hydraulic fracturing delivery system available in the industry today.","Globally, 2012 is a watershed year for the expansion of unconventionals. In addition to providing services on several of the first commercial unconventional wells in Australia, in China, we expanded our service footprint in key market such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Argentina.","Ultimately, we differentiate ourselves by offering a fit-for-purpose completion coupled with superior frac designed that maximizes well productivity and delivers the lowest cost per BOE for our customers.","In the deepwater area, we are seeing the payoff of our recent infrastructure investments with key contract wins and market share gains in areas such as Malaysia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Brazil. Our value proposition for deep water remains focused at improving reliability and integrity in well construction and completion activities and helping our customers reduce uncertainty. We believe our deep water technology portfolio expanding market position and service quality reputation will benefit us as new build deepwater rigs live in the market.","And lastly we continue to build out our capabilities in servicing mature fields. Over the last year, we\u2019ve seen great success in critical investments we\u2019ve made in the areas of specialty chemicals and artificial lift. These investments along with Boots & Coots have allowed us to more than double the size of our matured field business over the last two years. Our focus here is to share our customer\u2019s production and improved recovery rates, and provide the technology to optimize performance over the life of the field.","Underpinning these strategies as a continued significant investment in new technology, we\u2019ve more than doubled our technology spend in the last two years. And this year we will be expanding our R&D spend at a rate faster than our revenue growth as we further globalize our R&D footprint and drive solutions in unconventional deepwater and matured fields.","Now let me move on to operations. Internationally 2012 played out the way we told you it would. We exited the year with margins in the upper teens and averaged 15% for the full-year.","Let\u2019s look at 2013. There we anticipate international customer spend increase in the high single digits, maybe more, maybe less. Whatever it turns out to be, the market share gains we\u2019ve had, we expect our revenue to outpace the increased spending levels. We also anticipate full-year margins should average in the upper teens for 2013. We believe that this above market growth rate will come from volume increases as we ramp up on recent wins in new projects from continued improvement in those markets where we\u2019ve made strategic investments in the past several years, from the introduction of new technology, and some modest pricing increases and cost recovery on selected contracts.","Shifting to North America, 2012 was a very challenging year for the industry. Operations we\u2019re impacted by headwinds such as guar costs, pricing pressures and a significant drop in the natural gas rig activity. However I want to be clear before you listen to the rest of the presentation. We believe that the fourth quarter marked the bottom for U.S. land margins, and Jeff and Mark will tell you why we believe this.","Let\u2019s look at how we see 2013 for North America. First, due to the significant post Thanksgiving slowdown we experienced, we closed the year with approximately a one month supply of high-priced guar inventory remaining. We will be taking delivery of lower-priced guar this quarter and by the second quarter we expect our guar inventory cost to be at market rates.","Although current guar market prices have reduced from the high as we saw in early 2012, guar prices remain above historical levels. This has had a silver lining as it is making our fast growing PermStim fluid system a compelling economic alternative and more importantly puts a sealing on the prices we will need to pay for guar in the future.","In the U.S. we believe the rig count will continue to grow from current levels, but will average down slightly for the year compared to 2012. However we are seeing higher well efficiencies due to increased pad drilling, more 24 hour operations, rig fleet upgrades and significant advancements in drilling and completion technologies.","In 2012 we saw the average days per horizontal well drilled drop approximately 15% compared to 2011 and we anticipate continued efficiency improvements in the upper single-digits for 2013. We believe that this continued shift toward efficiency boards very well for us in the coming years, as no company has the ability to execute factory type operations like Halliburton.","We\u2019re also beginning to see signs of activity improvements in the first quarter as compared to December. The given the pronounced seasonal decline we saw in the fourth quarter it could take longer for activity levels to fully rebound to second or third quarter levels from 2012.","For the remainder of the year we expect activity levels to gradually increase, but we are expecting continued pricing pressure as we renew our last tranche of stimulation contracts. Many of our competitors are operating at breakeven or lost positions which should set a floor on stimulation pricing. However, an improvement in pricing will require a meaningful decrease in excess capacity which can happen of course in two ways, either equipment wears out, it is not replaced or increased activity takes up the slack. ","We are expecting the industry to add hardly any capacity this year and over time, we should see a drop in excess horsepower due to normal attrition. Increasing oil activity and rising service intensity will also help to a certain extent. However, we believe that without a significant uptick in natural gas drilling, it is difficult to see a path for pressure pumping equipment to reach equilibrium this year.","Our view is that the U.S. natural gas drilling will not be a major activity driver in 2013, although the rig count in that area appears to have flattened. The decline in output from existing natural gas wells will likely be offset by additional volumes generated from new gas wells, the restart of shutting wells and associated gas from new oil wells if we see any meaningful uptick in gas activity that likely will not occur until the second half of the year. That being said, we still strongly believe in the long-term fundamentals of the gas business and are not going to abandon that market.","We have stayed with those customers in the natural gas basins even as some of our competitors left to chase work in the oil plays. This strategy has deepened our relationship with these customers and positions us well when gas activity rebounds. In the meantime, we may need in these basins as a focus has a negative ongoing impact on our margins, but we believe this is the right decision for the long run.","Our growth strategy going forward remains the same. We'll continue to grow our market share in deepwater, in global unconventionals and in mature assets. I'm optimistic about the coming year and our ability to rebuild our North American margins and realized continued revenue and margin growth in our international business. And lastly, we remain laser-focused on capital and margin discipline when it comes to pressure pumping.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to provide an operational update and come back at the end of the call to summarize. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","Thanks Dave and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results. Overall, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter. Revenue of $7.3 billion was up 3% sequentially and represents the highest quarterly revenue in company history with record revenue from all three of our international regions, our Drilling and Evaluation division and eight of our product lines.","From an operating income perspective, our Latin America and Middle East\/Asia regions delivered record profit in our completion tool product line which holds the number one global market share position also had record operating income. Consolidated operating income of 981 million was flat to the previous quarter and was driven by strong performance from our international regions where we saw revenue and operating income growth of 20% and 39%, respectively, compared to fourth quarter of 2011.","Latin America posted an excellent quarter with revenue up 14% sequentially, despite a 2% drop in the rig count and operating income increases of 25% compared to last quarter and increased drilling fluids activity along with higher software sales in Mexico and Colombia led to the growth for the region.","Also contributing to the stellar quarter was project management in Mexico followed by higher stimulation and cementing activity in Argentina. An operational highlight this quarter was our tremendous success with various Turbopower turbine drilling tools in deepwater Brazil, drilling a horizontal pre-salt well the turbine tools surpassed customer expectation achieving a record rate of penetration on its first run in the Campos Basin and saving the operator multiple days of rig time.","Moving to the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue grew 11% sequentially and operating income increased 35% driven by year-end sales of software, completion tools and other equipment as well as the ongoing service revenue from key contract wins that have now started up. Now compared to the same period last year, operating income has increased by over 50%, which we would believe as a solid proof point that we\u2019re successfully executing on our international strategy.","Sequentially, Middle East, Asia revenue and operating income increased 14% and 46% respectively. Production enhancement led the growth with year-end equipment sales, in China, and increased activity in Australia and Saudi Arabia. Also contributing were completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Indonesia and higher software sales in China and Thailand.","As we continue to lead in global unconventionals, there are two items to note in Middle East and Asia market. In the fourth quarter we saw our first CleanStream unit, a mechanical ultraviolet alternative to biocides, and part of our CleanSuite environmental system successfully deployed in the Cooper Basin of Australia. And in the Malay Basin we executed the first high-pressure, high-temperature hydraulic fracturing job, utilizing our Sirocco frac fluid. Faster than indicated, up to 10 times improvement in production against offset wells and we\u2019re optimistic that this advancement will lead to further tight gas development in the area.","Our mature assets strategy continues to deliver with several key wins this year. In Malaysia we were selected to provide the services to exploit the remaining reserves in the Bayan Field with the potential total value of $1.2 billion. In the Middle East, we provided production monitoring SmartWell capability. It reduced water production by 2\/3s and increased recovery factor by fold.","Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS. We saw revenue and operating income increased 8% and 23% respectively compared to the prior quarter. The improvement was driven by the seasonally higher year-end completion tool sales in the North Sea and Angola, followed by improved drilling activity in the North Sea and Russia. Higher end of year software sales in Russia and Nigeria also contributed to the improved profitability. In deepwater East Africa we\u2019re awarded a six-year multi-country, multi-product line contract. This is the single largest contract award in East Africa today and is evidence of our deepwater leadership and service quality that we have been delivering in this market.","Also in the third quarter we opened the industry leading advanced perforating flow lab. This state of the art facility allows us to simulate a wide range of downhole condition\u2019s to evaluate perforation solutions in a controlled environment enabling us to maximize our customer\u2019s production.","And before we move on to North America, I want to be very clear on one of my top priorities as Chief Operating Officer. While I have not met many of you, you can be certain that I am dead focused on capital discipline, especially in the frac equipment area. Capital discipline to me means two things. First that we won't to increase our horsepower capital until we\u2019re achieving a better return on our deployed fleet and second, we will not put stacked equipment back to work until it's at an acceptable contract rate. If we have to stack more equipment to achieve these results we will do so.","Now let\u2019s look at North America results for the fourth quarter, where the market played out consistent with our previous commentary. We saw a significant drop-off in activity in the back-half of the quarter as customers exhausted their budgets. Our North America revenue was down 5% compared to the previous quarter, right inline with the sequential 5% drop in the U.S. land rig count. North America operating income was down 22% sequentially driven mainly by reduced activity levels around the holidays. Increased consumption over higher-priced supply of guar and continued pricing pressure in hydraulic frac ring as we renewed contracts.","Fourth quarter margins were also negatively impacted by the tactical decisions we made to position our business for higher future profitability. These impacts include the upfront costs associated with our frac and the future initiative, the margin impact of our continued presence in the North America natural gas basins and costs related to the idling of equipment and crews during the quarter.","And on our last call we said that we would park equipment in order to help stabilize the transactions priced market and to avoid setting a new low price point for stimulation. We also said that we would be retiring older equipment as we upgrade to our more efficient Q10 pumps. In keeping with these strategies during the quarter, we temporary stacked 10 fleets and retired two older fleets from service. We continue to incur the personnel costs as we retain those crews from the stack fleets. In addition, we expect that the new Q10s deployed into the North America market will be offset by the retirement of older fleets.","Now as an update to the Frac of the Future, we are continuing the multiyear rollout of our Q10 pumps. Where they are deployed, we are seeing a marked improvement in terms of well-side efficiencies. As a result of an improved operating cycle and reduced maintenance profile, our Q10 fleets delivered the same capabilities as our traditional fleet with up to 20% fewer trucks on location and with fewer personnel.","In the fourth quarter, we also introduced our first spread of dual-fuel Q10s into the field. These units use both diesel and clean-burning natural gas which is more environmentally friendly than traditional pump trucks and as the infrastructure matures, will position us to use the abundant supply of North American natural gas as our power source.","In the second quarter of 2012, we introduced PermStim. And after 2,000 successful stages, it has established itself as a premium fluid system. The proprietary chemistry of this fracturing fluid results in improved well performance. As an alternative to guar-based systems, its cost profile will also protect us against escalating war costs in the future.","Regarding stimulation pricing, the bulk of our customer contracts have been renewed and we expect the small remainder to be renegotiated in the early part of this year. There is still risk of further pricing declines, but we believe they are mainly behind us as there will be virtually no incremental equipment entering the market in 2013.","With respect to our other product lines, we did experience some pricing pressure in specific basins; notably for those services closer to the frac. We believe this issue is primarily related to the significant drop in activity that occurred in the fourth quarter. And as activity levels return, we would expect to see these product lines follow suit and stabilize as well.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we had a record quarter in terms of both revenue and operating income. For the year, our Gulf of Mexico operation grew 37% as we gained market share during the recent activity increases. Given the deepwater rig arrivals in 2012 and those scheduled for the back half of 2013, we anticipate this activity improvement will translate into double-digit revenue growth and higher incremental margins.","We also believe we will continue to grow our market share as these rigs move to a completion cycle on the new wells and anticipate that 2013 will be another record year for the Gulf.","So to summarize North America, we have seen margin pressure in two major categories. First, the transitory ones which include our higher bar exposure, the cost of our high equipment increase, upfront costs associated with Frac of the Future and our ongoing commitment to operate in the gas basins. These costs should take care of themselves as the year progresses.","The second category covers market based issues, specifically around natural gas activity and excess pressure pumping capacity which in turn is affecting stimulation pricing. These will balance out as the broader market corrects. Given the market dynamics, 2013 will be a year where we focus on driving cost out of the system. Frac of the Future initiative will help us get there, but in the meantime we've already made headcount reductions in the quarter and we're looking at areas where we can further optimize our cost structure. As a result, you may see an impact from severance in our first quarter results.","And now Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks Jeff and good morning, everyone. Our corporate and other expense totaled $106 million this quarter and included approximately $35 million for continued investment in our Battle Red completion tools manufacturing and other strategic initiatives. These activities will continue throughout 2013 but the related costs should begin to decline in the second half of the year.","We anticipate the impact of these investments will again be approximately $0.03 per share after-tax in the first quarter. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will average between $110 million and $115 million per quarter during 2013, including these strategic costs.","Our effective tax rate was 34% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the full-year 2012. As mentioned previously, we\u2019re nearing completion of a strategic project to realign our international operations to better position us for improved delivery of our products and services to our international customers, closer alignment to our international suppliers, more efficient use of our field technology and an overall reduction of cost.","Some of the indirect outcomes that we expect out of this transformational initiative will be an increase in our international earnings and a wide reduction of our effective tax rate going forward. As a result, we\u2019re currently forecasting the 2013 effective tax rate will be approximately 29% to 30%.","During the fourth quarter, we recorded an $80 million tax benefit in discontinued operations, related to the payment of our liability to Petrobras under a guarantee relating to work perform number of years ago on the Barracuda-Caratinga project by KBR.","As we move into 2013, we\u2019re anticipating the typical sequential decline in international revenue and margins during the first quarter due to the absence of year-end seasonal activities as well as weather related weakness in the North Sea and Eurasia and this drop-off could be more pronounced compared to previous years due to our strong fourth quarter performance. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, we\u2019re anticipating a mid teen percentage increase in revenues with a modest improvement in margins, which is evidence of our expanding international market share. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect international activity levels to recover from the seasonal impact and margins to steadily improve over the course of the year with full-year international margins averaging in the upper teens.","Moving on to North America, we expect U.S. rig count in the first quarter will be somewhat roughly the mirror image of the fourth quarter, but down slightly on average. Our expectation is that the rig count will improve throughout the year as activity resumes, but the full-year average for 2013 will be down in the low single-digits compared to 2012. In this activity environment we anticipate frac pricing will continue to be somewhat soft. However for Halliburton we\u2019ve got a very beneficial tailwind going into 2013 which is our significantly lower guar input cost. We expect the continued activity improvement in the Gulf of Mexico will also positively contribute to margins as well as cost optimization in our North America land operations as a result of our Frac of the Future and Battle Red initiatives. Therefore as Dave mentioned previously, we are optimistic about the coming year on our ability to improve our North American margins beginning as earliest the first quarter.","As you know we've been trying to operate within our cash flows, though we've also been trying to achieve higher investment yields on our excess cash. So, during 2012 we started investing in some longer-term fixed income securities that don\u2019t meet the accounting definition of cash equivalents. During the fourth quarter I\u2019m proud to say our cash and investment securities increased by $779 million. For the full-year we also achieved an increase in cash and investment securities, even as we absorbed a record $3.6 billion of capital expenditures, an additional $200 million of acquisitions. We anticipate a continued reduction in working capital as a result of lower guar inventories and coupled with a lower capital spend we expect to see higher free cash flow in 2013, and we are anticipating that our CapEx for 2013 will be approximately $3 billion which is about 16% lower than our 2012 spend level.","We currently intend to direct less capital towards the North American market in our Q10 horsepower build we\u2019ll be focused on fleet replacement. The displaced equipment will be retired from the market and the emphasis will be on the rollout of the Q10 pump and other ancillary equipment design to advance our Frac of the Future goals. Finally we\u2019re expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion during 2013.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments.","David J. Lesar","Okay, thanks Mark. Just real quickly, we are very proud of our record setting fourth quarter international results. This has been an ongoing focus of our growth strategy and I think these results bear that out. So for 2013 we expect international margins will average in the upper teens and as we have discussed we have called the bottom on U.S. land margins for the fourth -- as of the fourth quarter. With our lower capital spend and improved working capital, we expect to generate an even higher level of free cash flow in 2013 and we remain very focused on capital discipline.","So with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now opened. Angie, you're line is now opened.","Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","All right, thanks. First congratulations on the very strong fourth quarter and clearly for the year as well, particularly in the international markets.","David Lesar","Thank you, Angie. I appreciate it. Some folks have been critical of us chasing the international, especially the deepwater market aggressively over the past few years, but as I said then and I'll say now, I think that it's worth it. These are long-term markets, these are long-term contracts that allow for aggressive use of our technology and aggressive up-selling opportunities. So, I think you're starting to see the payoff now and you certainly will see it for the next several years.","Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","I agree and even better. I would add to that that you've done it on the top line but you've also shown very strong improvements in margins also above the peer groups, so a double bonus.","David Lesar","Yeah, thank you.","Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","So, to follow-up with that, your guidance for Eastern Hemisphere margins average in the high-teens slightly higher than our estimates which is obviously a positive, but I assume Middle East is a big driver of that. However, you referenced E&P spending in the high single-digits for 2013. Would it seem reasonable to you that growth for revenues in 2013 could be in the low to mid double-digits, and where do you expect to see the greatest strength?","Mark McCollum","Angie, this is Mark. The answer is yes and we do expect to outgrow the market in line with our strategies of outgrowing the overall increase in the deepwater market which we think will be a particular strength in 2013, on the back of our market share gains in Latin America as well as some of the increased activity in unconventionals and Saudi Arabia and Australia. And of course I should also reference the deepwater market in East Africa, those will probably be areas that will be primary growth areas, but we are expecting growth rate in the low single-digits -- I mean low double digits, even though we're probably a bit more pragmatic about what customer spend rates will increase on a year-over-year basis in the international markets.","Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","Right now, you mentioned low-double digits for revenue growth based on what you see today?","Mark McCollum","Yes.","Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then as an unrelated follow-up, I know in the past you've mentioned returning capital to shareholders in 2013 is a priority. I guess the question is, is it still a priority for '13 and is there a preference for share buybacks versus a dividend or could both be considered and does the Macondo timing have any influence on this decision?","Mark McCollum","That's a great question, Angie, and the answer is that yes, it's still a priority. We, as you heard through our comments, have been very focused on trying to not only just achieve a positive cash flow result but improving that cash flow result as we go into 2013. We're in the process of finalizing our discussions with the Board and internally about our strategic initiatives for 2013. We'll have that wrapped up in the coming weeks. And in that discussion I think the answer is that everything is on the table, but dividends, share buyback, I mean we certainly are staying tuned to what happens on the Macondo front, but it's not an issue that will preclude us from consideration of some of those options. And so, I guess the best way that I can say is, is stay tuned.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is opened.","James West - Barclays Capital","Good morning, gentlemen.","David Lesar","Hi, James.","James West - Barclays Capital","And congrats again on another good quarter. A question on North America as we look at the progression throughout this year. I mean you've got clearly some tailwinds with guar, the Gulf of Mexico, some improving U.S. land rig count. But you\u2019ve talked in the past, about normalized North American margins, you\u2019re much higher than where they\u2019re today. Is that something that\u2019s possible to get too in this type of environment where we\u2019ve, less slowly growing U.S. rig count or is this more likely when we get back to a better environment in \u201914?","Mark A. McCollum","This is Mark again. I think James, the answer to that is that probably in the slower growing environment where we continue to see some pressure around pricing in the broad market and a \u2013 its going to be difficult sort of close up the excess capacity situation until we see some meaningful increase in the gas rig activity. I think that\u2019s also going to mean that its going to be difficult to get us back to normalized margins, which we still believe are in the mid 20s for Halliburton.","James West - Barclays Capital","Right.","Mark A. McCollum","And so we \u2013 as we said, we\u2019re calling the bottom, we see that at least the things that we perceive this tailwinds to our margin situation sort of trump the continued pressure that we will feel in frac pricing and possibly \u2013 peripherally in some of the other product service lines that are little bit \u2013 they\u2019re closer to the frac than others. But I think that its just \u2013 its going to be difficult to drive them up back to those sort of historic normalized levels without a \u2013 what we sort of perceive is a normalized rig count environment, which includes a healthy dose of gas activity.","James West - Barclays Capital","Okay. So, but you would suggest though that healthy margin gains is not getting back to that what you see is normalized?","Mark A. McCollum","Yes. That\u2019s right.","James West - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then just one follow-up for me on the fracture side, obviously a few more contracts to rollover, but some of the initial rollovers of your longer term contracts would have happened when pricing was still above where it is today. Do you \u2013 can you give us maybe some help on percentage of contracts that maybe or above what you think pricing is in the market today and how many rollover as we go through the year?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, thanks James. This is Jeff. I think the \u2013 those contracts tend to roll each year, so we\u2019re working our way through the bulk of those. So, from a competitive standpoint as we look out we\u2019ve probably 8% of our business under contract and so we don\u2019t see a huge step down that will occur sort of resetting the prices from the first quarter that with last year.","Mark A. McCollum","Yeah, I think James, let me add one thing. Obviously, as Jeff said about 80% of our stuff is under contract and yeah we have some of the stuff that while the year ago at this time rolling over now, but if we don\u2019t see a price that\u2019s acceptable to us we may just roll it on a month-to-month basis, there\u2019s nothing that says you are required to roll it from year-to-year and in some cases we won't do it, because we don\u2019t want to get locked into a price we don\u2019t like, so we\u2019ll just go on more a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter. A couple of things, and first of all on the North American margin front; could you help us little bit understand the trajectory here, could you quantify on the margin front like you know what kind of how guar could provide in the first quarter?","Mark A. McCollum","This is Mark, Waqar. I don\u2019t think we want to give specific margin guidance; we\u2019re trying to step away from that for competitive reasons. But, I think we have been fairly transparent that the guar situation or Halliburton impacted us through the end of the third quarter about 600 basis points. In the fourth quarter that went up because we stepped back our usage of PermStim and tried to drive harder on using some of the higher-priced guar, so the marginal impact in Q4 of guar as compared to the pricing of guar back in January of 2012 was about 650 basis points.","And then the difference in margins, I would say roughly from there is split about 50-50 on pricing and activity in the fourth quarter, and so, I guess, if that kind of gives you some roadmap as we then step back, we\u2019ll wrap up this quarter using that higher-priced guar average in, lower sort of market based guar pricing into our inventory averages that should take us down. Now, the difference in \u2013 I think I\u2019ve also articulated that we sort of triangulate the difference in our guar pricing and our competitors has been in our view about 400 basis points or so through the third quarter, and I think that that maybe another market you kind of see as we start rolling back that\u2019s the big opportunity that we have vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Secondly, just on the pressure pumping revenue growth side, obviously November and December were impacted by the holiday season, but when you compare the month of October, how did that compare with the third quarter?","Mark McCollum","I'm sorry, your question is on our just overall activity?","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Activity on the revenues in pressure pumping or C&P in the month of October, how did that compare to the third quarter? Do you see any uptick or do you see continued decline in October versus the prior\u2026?","Mark McCollum","Yeah, the month of October actually was very strong for us. It was a really good month and in fact, early part of November was really strong too. As we looked at the market overall, we saw a fairly modest step down in the rigs, at least our activity through Thanksgiving and then a more dramatic step between Thanksgiving and December 15th. But we sort of triangulate if you look across the overall rig count, most of the rig count drop happened in the last three weeks of December, and kind of bottom fell out and our triangulation about 80 rigs went out of the market in the last three weeks of the month. And our business tended to follow that and we think that that maybe overall for the entire quarter at least our calculations about 170 rigs went out. So it kind of gives you a sense of 50% on the three weeks. Does that help?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Good morning, guys and thank you for making me look smarter than I really am.","David Lesar","You're welcome, Jim.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Jeff, a question, whenever a company management talks about a transformational event my ears perk up. You were talking about the strategic reorganization supply chain. Can you wax poetic for me for a few minutes on that and the implications of that?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, thanks Jim. We call it Battle Red, but it's a combination of rolling out our Q10 technology which is more efficient, it runs at a lower cost point and allows us to take people off-location. So that's part of that. It's broader though because we're also doing things in the back office with smartphone technology which has been rolled out through a large degree. It also allows us to take out a lot of back office costs. So, from a transformational standpoint, it's lower -- it's surface efficiency or lower cost per BOE for our clients, but then also internally to make sure that we're taking advantage of really what's possible today from smartphone sort of computational platform.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","And you mentioned this both internationally and domestically?","Jeff Miller","Starting domestically. At some point, it would move internationally.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you very much. And my follow-up question, can you guys give us some help on the magnitude of year-end sales for the international market? Just so we can kind of normalize expectations going forward. I know that Baker Hughes, their end of year sales were double last year. Just give us some idea because obviously you did fabulous in the international markets?","David Lesar","We don't typically try to give that much of detailed information on our direct sales, so I apologize. It certainly was a step up from where we had been on a year-over-year basis. It was a little bit higher. But in terms of our expectation, it was kind of in line. We saw more direct sales in our completion and production division than we had seen in prior years, some equipment and things into China and that probably was sort of year-over-year difference that we had. But clearly -- I mean it's going to be a big step down in Q1 I think in line with what everybody else has said, they will have an impact but in terms of our -- as I said on the call, our growth on a year-over-year basis is still going to be about 16% roughly.","Jeff Miller","Jim, that's what Mark said I think in the call, maybe we weren't as clear as we should have been. If you just compare where we think we'll be Q1 2013 to Q1 2012, we'll be up about 16%. So that's in my view sort of normalizes out the product sales and tells you sort of what -- sort of service revenue increase we're looking at year-over-year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Dave, thanks for that clarity. I\u2019m a little bit slow, can you just say that one more time that up 16% was at first quarter \u2013 the first quarter or second quarter, the second quarter?","David J. Lesar","No. Its first \u2013 its first quarter of 2012 to first quarter of 2013.","Mark A. McCollum","And that should be up 16%.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","International, okay. Great.","Mark A. McCollum","International.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Thanks for clarifying that. Now, in terms of the North American market, you guys indicated some pricing pressures, of some other product lines, but those that were more closely related to frac, so can I take that to mean that you\u2019re really not seeing any pricing pressures for any of your drilling related service lines at this juncture and what would be your perspective on expectation for pricing pressures in those product lines going forward?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, this is Jeff. We look ahead \u2013 I mean, look through the fourth quarter and we saw mostly activity declines having an impact, which we think right itself to the degree next year. So, from a pricing pressure perspective we\u2019re not seeing that now. As we look out into next year, we don\u2019t see that, we don\u2019t see the over supply necessarily the same way as we\u2019ve seen in frac, so we\u2019re not seeing it.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my final one here is just, in the rack you guys indicated the matching new product checked, its been a drag on international margins so on and so forth. I was wondering if you could give us some rough guidelines as to what that impact had been and are you guys still on schedule to \u2013 for that project to roll-off, I think with sometime here in the second quarter, right?","David J. Lesar","Yes. In the second quarter of 2013 the project should come to an end. Over the last quarter we had much better rig performance, things have been looking up, the performance in our rack overall was significantly better in Q4 and basically a breakeven. So, we feel good about how things are shaping up. We got some new contract work going into 2013 in that market and scale helps from an absorption standpoint, so we\u2019re continuing to press forward and hopefully once this [launch] \u2013 new project behind us, which at this point as long as we\u2019re executing it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. What we\u2019re really trying to do is to move beyond and put ourselves in a firmly profitable standpoint which we believe will happen during 2013, sort of toward the middle of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose. Your line is now opened.","James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Co.","Thank you, and let me add to the previous comments. Great job Dave in the quarter and for the year as a whole.","David J. Lesar","Thanks.","James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Co.","My question has to do with \u2013 with Russia and you highlighted a contract with BP-TNK in the quarter; could you one, give us some ideas to the significance of that contract win and then secondly, your market position in Russia let\u2019s just say well below your normal market share especially given this and I would imagine that that\u2019s \u2013 that this is a real area of emphasis for you because of the size of the Russian market given it's the second largest market in the world. Can you talk about your strategy in Russia and whether you think you can get up to your desired market position through internal development or do you think acquisitions of maybe existing Russian companies have to play a part in that?","David J. Lesar","Yeah, thanks Jim. The contract we referred to is Em-Yoga which is our mature field type activity if we\u2019re able to go in and prove really the breadth of our technology, so in fact rediscovering reservoirs and then adding to those, so we are excited about that, it's the leading edge of what we think could be more to come. So, I won't give you numbers in terms of significance but it's, I think consistent with our strategy to use our consulting capability, to not just pull through our services, but actually develop new thoughts and new applications of existing technology as well, more broadly with respect to Russia, it's a place where we are excited about the outlook. We think we\u2019ve got the right team on the ground. We think we\u2019re \u2013 have the right technology as that market moves more into what I\u2019d say is our sweet spot around multistage fracturing and some other types of mature field activity. We would expect that to grow with respect to M&A. I mean, we always consider those things but I don't think it's a requirement.","James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Co.","Are you saying that you think you can get up to what's a normal or are you saying you can get up to what you would consider to be an acceptable or normal market share position just by internal growth. I mean you\u2019re like one-fourth the size of (indiscernible), maybe half the size of Weatherford in Russia?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, Jim, let me handle this. Yeah, there's no doubt that our market share in Russia is not consistent with the market share that we would like or we experience in other parts of the world, but my view is we got to be smart about this. And there are certainly organic growth opportunities to grow in Russia and we are growing our business there. But for us to get up to the size of some of our competitors, we would have to look at some major M&A. And as you know, we've talked about this many times with you and sort of with a broader group, we are focused on returns and focused on capital discipline.","So, my view is that the need to be larger in Russia does not trump the need to continue to be focused on capital discipline. So, I'm not going to go out and do a major M&A deal in Russia just to get a revenue base that's the same size as our competitors, but really never generates the kind of returns that we want to see off of that. So, I would say that the book is still open on it, but we don't feel any particular corporate need to go out and get a lot bigger in Russia because we're not going to do it and sacrifice margins and returns.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey of ISI Group. Your line is now opened.","Jud Bailey - ISI Group","Thanks. Good morning. And again, congratulations on good results. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on Brazil as you guys kind of get ramped up down there with some of your recent gains and just help us think about how we think about revenues growing as the drilling contract kicks in and maybe margins and startup costs there that you may incur?","Mark McCollum","The interesting thing is there's still some of the contracts that have not been completely approved or signed. And so we've been in a transitional period for a number of months on things like drilling that's actually allowed us to -- we've been mobilizing but that actually allowed us to kind of spread the cost sum to take off some of the brunt that what otherwise might appear more difficult in terms of a margin environment. But from an activity standpoint, the activity is beginning to pick up. Brazil grew very dramatically for us in 2012. We expect that to continue to grow. We'll be putting the infrastructure capital to work in that area. We have a new technology center that has continued to expand and working with some very specific projects with Petrobras down there we're pretty excited about and those are going to begin to show themselves.","So, I guess from our standpoint, we feel very, very good about what Brazil will do in 2013. This sort of the challenge is on. We also feel great about Mexico, some pretty exciting things happening in Mexico. In the Latin American environment, we've kind of got a horse race going on in that market as to who's going to sort of get the revenue poll and growth crown there. I think you should stay tuned for a very good 2013 coming on Latin America again just like 2012.","Jud Bailey - ISI Group","All right. So just to make sure I'm clear. So it sounds like in terms of Brazil any way, you've already incurred some of the start-up costs and mobilization costs, but haven't really felt the impact of the revenue yet and that will probably come in, in 1Q, 2Q. Is that fair to say?","Mark McCollum","I think that's fair to say, yes.","Jud Bailey - ISI Group","Okay.","Mark McCollum","But again, as we look at it and plan and kind of in our margin forecast, the great thing that's happened as a result of the expansion of our share there is while yeah, there's some pricing impacts of that new revenue, the higher level of activity is allowing absorption of fixed cost base that's sort of blunting the impact of that lower price. And so on a marginal basis, our margins in Brazil have continued to improve over this point of time even though some of the contracts have already kicked in at lower pricing.","Jud Bailey - ISI Group","Okay, that's good color. Thank you. And if I could, just my follow-up would just be one more on North America. You guys have done a pretty good job of kind of articulating how you see that market evolving over the course of the year. I'm just curious \u2013 I know the month isn't over yet, but I'm just curious how has activity or customer enquiries been so far in January maybe relative to your expectations 60 days ago?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, we\u2019re seeing it, not the way we thought it would roll out last quarter which is, we saw the \u2013 seasonal declines kind of between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s and then, but then I\u2019ve seen as customer budgets were exhausted and towards the end of the year we\u2019re seeing the mild \u2013 the uptick that we were expecting to see kind of end of January as kind of our key customers get back to work.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now opened.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Thanks, good morning guys.","David J. Lesar","Hi, how are you doing?","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Good, thanks. Maybe, I guess, to the degree that you feel that you can\u2019t speak about it, maybe you can give us an update on the MDL process here in front of the trial start data in late February. Any comments you can make on potential negotiations with the class action group et cetera.","David J. Lesar","I think that probably the easiest thing to say, the trial is still scheduled to start in late February, we\u2019re moving forward hard towards that process, the lawyers have been sort of furiously working through all of the discovery actions in preparation for the trial. That is our course at this point. I know there\u2019s been some other activities with the other participants in the trial but at this data I\u2019d say nothing, there\u2019s been no discussions on our side or our path and so our general view is we\u2019re moving to litigation and that\u2019s what our preparations are set to do.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just an unrelated follow-up, maybe helps to [cheers] up even though it's at some level I appreciate that this can be a bit misleading, but the last couple of years have been marked to maybe more so the I guess the \u201911 and \u201912 but they\u2019ve been marked by some very sizable tenders, particularly in the offshore environments and that\u2019s a lot of due to grab very significant market share as you guys have discussed. Are there as \u201913 emerges, are there -- sort of how many significant kind of tender\u2019s are you looking at? Should we expect to see that that\u2019s another chance to seize more market share or have some degree of those large tenders sort of \u2013 do they wind down now?","Jeff Miller","Now without being specific with respect to tenders, our backlog as we look out into the next year or so it\u2019s probably bigger than it\u2019s ever been in terms of opportunities [set] so, those tend to be out there quite often and yes some big ones occurred last year, but we\u2019re pretty confident that there will be opportunities to win. I was saying that it's always very competitive in those large tender situations, and so if we go out at those carefully with always a solid plan on how we make the returns that we want to make, just look back to last year kind of putting the eastern hemisphere numbers together as evidence of that.","David J. Lesar","Now I would, let me just add a little color to it. I think as, Jeff has said the opportunities at our pipeline as we call it is probably as big as it's ever been, but what's not there either big, mega, must win kinds of tenders it's just \u2013 it's a lot of small to medium sized tenders that are out there and that add up to the biggest pipeline that we\u2019ve ever seen. So, we think that\u2019s a good thing, because with the infrastructure we put down and some of the track record we still have developed off of some of these prior tenders, I think that it's put us on the map in some of the customers eyes of looking at us as a real alternative on some of these which again is why we\u2019re so excited about what we see going forward in the international and especially the offshore and deepwater markets.","Kelly Youngblood","And with that I think we\u2019ve went past our time. So I wanted to, on behalf of the Halliburton management team, thank you for your participation today and Sam you can go ahead and close the call.","Operator","Thank you.

And welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton's first quarter 2014 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is also available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, COO.","I would like to remind our audience that some of today\u2019s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on our performance.","These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results, and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.","Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website.","In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of an increase to our reserve related to the Macondo litigation that was taken in the first quarter of 2013 unless otherwise noted.","We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. We are going to change up our format this quarter to more effectively communicate the items you've told us you want to hear. I will provide the highlights then Mark will add the financial details that will be followed by Jeff who will give the operations and technology update.","So here are my highlights for our first quarter. Results played out about as expected that the earnings mix was a bit different. We had record first quarter total company revenue of $7.3 billion and operating income increased 8% over the first quarter of 2013 as a result of double-digit growth in the Eastern Hemisphere.","Now let\u2019s do our outlook by key geographies. Eastern Hemisphere activity continues to expand at a steady rate and is playing out about as expected. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged. We see customer spending levels increasing by the upper single digits and our revenue growth to be in the low double digits, and we still expect average full-year Eastern Hemisphere margins in the upper teens.","Latin America came in slightly better than we projected, but we continue to believe that 2014 will be a transitional year. For the full year, we expect Latin America revenue and profit to be in line with 2013 levels. Longer term we are very optimistic about our position in Latin America and the future growth potential of this market.","As Jeff will discuss, we were successful in winning over $3 billion in IPM contracts in Mexico during 2013 and the constitutional changes in Mexico seem to be progressing as planned and we believe the opportunity for foreign investment to come into this market will be very beneficial to our businesses beginning as early as 2015.","Turning to North America, as you know, I went through a number of turns in the market and let me tell you, I'm starting to feel the turn. I'm starting to feel the momentum swing not only that, I'm starting to see it happen. I\u2019m more excited about North America now than I have been since late 2011. Now I could be off by a quarter or so, but I do not believe I am wrong about this turn happening.","Now why is that? First, the sense of confidence I get when I talk to customers and the sense of confidence they have in their own business prospects. Supportive commodity prices today are translating into stronger cash flow than OpEx budgets for our customers and despite the logistical issues we saw in the first quarter, during March we saw record levels of revenues.","Completions intensity is rising, lateral links are increasing, stage counts are rising and the average well volume pumped has increased over 30% just since last year and due to natural attrition, demand growth in the Permian, we believe that excess frac capacity has tightened much faster than expected. And we don't think we'll have any problem filling our frac calendar through the end of the year and believe we will be able to pull-through additional product lines.","So how will this play out? First, we will drive efficiency leverage from our low-cost operating model. Second, we will gain incremental revenue from our customer base due to increase job sizes. And thirdly, as a result of tightening supply of equipment we can offset increases in input cost through reimbursement from our customers. And think about it, all of that comes without any help from the natural gas market.","So while the first quarter margins were impacted by weather and logistical issues, this will dissipate and North American margins should rebound to second half 2013 levels in the second quarter and we continue to expect North America margins will approach 20% before the end of the year.","Based on our continued confidence in our business prospects, we bought back an additional $500 million in shares during the first quarter. We still have $1.2 billion remaining in repurchase authorizations. Along with the buybacks we executed last year, we repurchased about 11% of the company since this time last year, well, also raising our quarterly dividend by 67%.","Now I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Mark to provide financial details, but before I do, I want to point out that as you work through Mark's financial commentary, you will see projected earnings per share growth of approximately 25% from Q1 to Q2 and even more increases after that. That is why I am so confident we can continue to deliver industry-leading growth, margins and returns, and continue to return significant cash to our shareholders. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our first quarter results. In the Eastern Hemisphere revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 16%, respectively, as a result of year-over-year growth in both the Middle East\/Asia and Europe, Africa, CIS regions.","Sequentially, we experienced a typical decline in revenue and margins during the first quarter due to the absence of seasonally higher year end software and product sales, as well as the normal first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and Australia.","In the Middle East\/Asia region both revenue and operating income increased by 13% compared to the prior year. Middle East\/Asia is projected to be our highest growth region this year led by Saudi Arabia.","In the first quarter Saudi Arabia grew by almost 50% compared to the first quarter of 2013, which clearly demonstrates the success we\u2019ve had in expanding our integrated project capability and our ability to leverage our unconventional leadership and expertise outside of North America. But the improvement was also driven by solid growth across the majority of our Asia-Pacific countries with Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia leading the Pac.","Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue and operating income increased 9% and 21%, respectively, on year-over-year basis. This improvement was led by higher completion tools sales and increased drilling and open-hole wireline activity in Angola. We also posted increased activity in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Algeria.","Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 9% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year, in large part due to a decline in drilling-related activity in Brazil. Increased unconventional stimulation and cementing activity in Argentina partially offset this decline.","We also continued to be impacted by an activity reduction in Mexico related to the cessation of older contracts in anticipation of new integrated projects awarded late last year and early this year. We are currently mobilizing for our Humapa and Mesozoic projects and they should get underway in the second and third quarters.","Moving to North America. Revenues were up 5% year-over-year relative to a 1% increase in the U.S. land rig count and operating income was flat. This was a challenging quarter for our North America business.","We experienced the coldest winter in 20 years which impacted activity in the Bakken, Niobrara, Marcellus and other operating areas including Canada during the early part of the quarter. Severe weather also disrupted rail movements further reducing efficiency.","Pricing contributed lower margins in the quarter as a result of pressure pumping contract renewals that went into effect late in the fourth quarter or early this year. Additionally, we saw rising cost in certain expense categories such as freight and fuel.","Our corporate and other expense totaled $89 million this quarter. We invested approximately $15 million in our HALvantage strategic initiatives during the first quarter, a bit lower than we expected. These activities will continue throughout 2014 but the related cost should begin to decline in the second half of the year.","We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 per share after tax in the second quarter. Including these strategic costs, we anticipate that corporate expenses for the second quarter were run approximately $95 million to $100 million.","Our effective tax rate for the first quarter also came in slightly lower than expected at approximately 27% due to a tax-basis adjustment. For the remainder of 2014, we\u2019re expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%.","Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $934 million, nearly triple the cash flow from the first quarter of 2013. Adjusting for the $500 million in stock repurchases, we generated approximately $300 million in cash during the quarter.","As we progressed through 2014, we believe we are well positioned to generate significantly more cash and then our cash flow will grow sustainably in the coming years. As a reminder, we\u2019re working to grow the percentage of cash available for distribution to shareholders up to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which has nearly doubled our historic average.","For the second quarter, we expect our average share count will be approximately 850 million. We continue to expect that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately $3 billion. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion during 2014.","Now moving to the eastern hemisphere outlook. In the second quarter, we\u2019re anticipating a low double-digit percentage improvement in revenue as we recover from the first quarter seasonal drop-off and we expect margins to move solidly into the midteens. Over the course of the year, revenue and margin should continue to progressively stairstep higher with full year margins averaging in the upper teens.","In Latin America, we expect for Brazil to be a headwind for the remainder of this year, an average of 24 rigs we\u2019re drilling during the first quarter and activity is expected to remain at this reduced level for the rest of 2014 and into 2015. However, IPM activity is beginning to pick up in Mexico to offset the Brazil slowdown.","For the second quarter, we expect a higher single-digit percentage improvement in revenue in Latin America. We believe margins will only be modestly higher than the first quarter, due not only to lower Brazil activity but also to project mobilization cost in Mexico. We expect a more meaningful step up in revenues and margins in the second half of the year. We should bring full year revenue and margins in line with 2013.","Concluding with North America, in the second quarter we\u2019re expecting higher U.S. land activity to more than offset the seasonal Canadian spring breakup. The logistics issues we experienced in the first quarter should also abate and we will yield more benefit from our HALvantage initiatives.","The net result is that we should see a low to mid-single digit percentage improvement in North America revenue in the second quarter and margins will return to second half 2013 levels. And as Dave commented earlier, we fully expect North America margins will approach 20% before year end. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for an operational update. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re excited about the North America market. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to hit our eastern hemisphere growth expectations.","The key point that I want to make today is that our strategies from unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields are working well. Our unconventional strategy continues to focus on driving a lower cost per BOE for our customers.","Our discussions with operators about their unconventional assets today are almost entirely centered around how to make more barrels and our strategy is dead focused on just that. Using frac of the future, CYPHER and Custom Chemistry, we\u2019ve consistently demonstrated that we can help operators get more barrels and improve their efficiency.","As Dave said, we\u2019re seeing rising servicing intensity across North America and this underscores the importance of our unconventional strategy. Lateral lengths have grown to over 10,000 feet in the market. Stage density has increased by 20% to 25% year-over-year in basins like the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. And in the Permian basin, the horizontal rig count has crossed over the 50% mark and you know, this is great for us.","The net result is that year-over-year we\u2019ve seen average completion volumes per well increase by 30% for our customer set which is driving demand for improved service efficiency at the wellhead. The frac of the future is delivering the increased efficiency we expected, reducing maintenance headcount and the capital required on location.","At the end of the first quarter, over 20% of our fleet has been converted to frac of the future. And we have largely completed the HALvantage rollout across our U.S. land operations. And CYPHER is making a difference in helping our customers increased their EURs, telling them where to drill, how to grill quarter, where to complete and how to complete. CYPHER is now gaining traction internationally as well as we deploy the platform to projects in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina and Australia.","When it comes to how to complete, the goal is maximum reservoir contact. And this is where our customized chemistry is generating results. One example is AccessFrac. AccessFrac is the system that combines leading-edge unconventional hydraulic fracturing techniques with proprietary diversion chemistry. And the result is substantially better multi-zone completions during plug-and-perf operations.","AccessFrac has been used in thousands of stages in every major U.S. basin and in a number of emerging international plays as well. Through successful application, our customers are seeing a production improvement on the order of 20% to 30%.","Moving to deepwater. Our outlook has always been one of steady growth, which is precisely what we're seeing play out and our strategy to reduce uncertainty and increase reliability is more important to our clients than ever.","As we think about our deepwater strategy, reducing uncertainty for our clients shortens their cycle time and improves their decision making. Our ICE Core fluid analysis technology does exactly that. It performs lab quality fluid analysis, down hole, using spectroscopy and proprietary algorithms.","Now this is important to our clients because one logging run can potentially save an operator costly weeks waiting on lab results. Instead oil, gas, water and other fluid composition can be determined during testing operations. And not surprisingly, this unique Halliburton technology is really gaining traction and is gaining traction in every deepwater market in the world. It\u2019s been successfully run in the North Sea, Latin America West Africa and Asia Pacific.","We\u2019re also reducing uncertainty with our subsalt reservoir characterization software, GeoShell. GeoShell is part of our leading DecisionSpace 3D Seismic Interpretation software. And it allows our clients do better image salt structures and then therefore map the subsurface more accurately. We\u2019re gaining traction in markets like the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where a large customer is now using GeoShell to improve technical success and reduce exploratory drilling risk.","Next, I'm very excited about the pipeline of projects that we see in mature fields. Our discussions with clients are increasingly focused on how to improve mature field production. And these assets are a terrific annuity for our customers whether they may be simple workover or a fulfilled optimization project. And as evidenced of increasing demand, we have over 6 billion in awarded integrated projects and over 25 billion in projects in the perceived pipeline, primarily in mature assets.","In Mexico, we have two significant integrated mature field mobilizations underway, the Humapa project in the north and the Mesozoic project in the south. And we expect Humapa to be generating revenue in the second quarter. And with Mesozoic, we are currently preparing the rigs required to deliver these high pressure wells and expect to spud the first well late in the second quarter.","This four year project is the largest of the recent mega tender awards and represents over 20% of the recent $4 billion tender round. We expect to be operating at a full run rate in early 2015. And there are two takeaways here. First, we have built the organizational capability to successfully execute large, mature field projects.","We have aggressively developed the reservoir skills to increase recovery factors for our customers at a field wide level and have built the service portfolio required to drill, complete and produce mature fields. And second, we're more constructive on Mexico than at the end of last year. And in spite of any near-term transition, it\u2019s clear that the future activity in Mexico is taking shape.","In closing, our strategies are working and working well in mature fields, deepwater and unconventionals and we are more confident than ever that we are on track to deliver on our commitments.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?","Dave Lesar","Thanks, Jeff and let me just do a quick wrap up. In summary, Eastern Hemisphere is playing out as we said it would. And based on our contract pipeline, we are confident in our estimates.","Latin America will be a transitional year, but our project wins in Mexico set us up for a stronger second half and an improved 2015. And as I said in North America, I can feel and I can see the turn coming, which gives us confidence in our outlook for the year.","Overall, our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. I am optimistic about our ability to grow our North America revenue and margins, realize industry-leading revenue and margin growth in our international businesses, which will result in EPS growth and significantly higher cash generation. We remain focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry-leading shareholder returns. Thank you.","Kelly Youngblood","Okay. Sam, we are ready to open up the questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now opened.","James West - Barclays","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Dave Lesar","Hey, James. Thanks.","James West - Barclays","It\u2019s good to hear your confidence on North America and we were certainly aligned with you there. One quick question on NAM, if we think about, Dave, you mentioned you are getting reimbursables for higher cost, are you also at the point now or getting close to the point where you can get net pricing on the product lines that have been somewhat out of balance here?","Jeff Miller","","Yeah, James. This is Jeff. First thing with respect to pricing, we are not going to discuss our pricing strategy. But if you go back to what Dave said, we have seen some capacity tightening and the ability to pass on some of the increased prices to customers but the point being from our standpoint, we stay focused on returns.","James West - Barclays","Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then Jeff or Dave, you mentioned a lot of confidence comes from everything outside of the gas markets. What are you seeing in gas markets today given where gas prices sit and where gas prices could go, given the tightness in the gas market?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, we like -- the short answer is gas. We don\u2019t have it in the plan for 2014.","James West - Barclays","Right.","Jeff Miller","We view sustainable prices north of $450 would be what\u2019s required to see gas move but we are seeing it support, probably cash flows for some clients. But if anything, the key takeaway is it would be a 2015 event.","James West - Barclays","Okay. Okay. Great. I got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now opened.","David Anderson - J.P. Morgan","Thanks. Good morning. So, I just had a question on the pressure pumping pricing comments. Obviously, you guys are pretty fired up. Help us understand kind of how you see this playing out. It sounds like there should be a couple more quarters of seeing contract rollovers kind of pushing pricing down. I was wondering if you could give us little more context as to what you are seeing out there. Is this primarily in the Permian that things are kind of changing around, but just a little bit of more color in terms of how that should play out this year?","Dave Lesar","But we don\u2019t see -- we don\u2019t see pricing pushing down, we described. What we\u2019ve described is contract rollovers through Q4 taking affect now having pricing affect. What I will just reiterate is that we stay focused on returns for our business. The ability to push through the pricing for inputs has been a bit of what we\u2019ve seen. But the vagaries of the tightening, it\u2019s tough to call that at this point. We have seen some tightening.","David Anderson - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Dave, I was just curios on your comments, you talked about kind of seeing the beginnings of another upswing here. You\u2019ve been here before. I was just wondering if you could kind of maybe give us little color in terms of how you are approaching this cycle different from the past. Obviously if you are seeing, if I would have to think some of your smaller competitors are starting to get fired up as well? Are you concerned about capacity coming to the market? Do you start building capacity little bit sooner? I\u2019m just curios, can you help us understand little bit how do you approach this cycle different without obviously giving away the secret sauce and what not?","Dave Lesar","I think, Dave, first of all, I do feel the turn coming, but I want to see it get here first. When it gets here, we will be making those kinds of decisions. I think a couple things to keep in mind. One is, we will continue to high-grade our customer base, as we go through this process, working with the ones that want to work with us to basically get the efficiencies that we need, the rate of returns that we need.","We are going to continue to rollout the Q10s, as we said at our Analyst Day. We believe it\u2019s a differentiating platform to go to market with, and we\u2019ll just sort of analyze the market as it comes to us and make those decisions at that point in time. I\u2019m certainly not going to give away our strategy at this point. But I think we're pretty well down the road in thinking about what we're going to do.","David Anderson - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now opened.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thanks. Good morning. I was a little bit unclear with regard to your commentary on the earnings growth and vision for the second half of the year, following the 25% upswing in the second quarter. Did you call for an additional 25% increase in EPS sequentially in Q3?","Mark McCollum","Bill, this is Mark. We did not call for 25% sequential from Q2 to Q3. I think what Dave was alluding to is that, if you just translate the notion of getting us back to a 20% margins in North America as the year progresses\u2026.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Yes.","Mark McCollum","\u2026as well as the continued strong growth, double-digit growth that we expect in our international or our Eastern Hemisphere markets, that\u2019s going to continue to add to what we think is going to be a good solid Q2 for us, coming off of a Q1 seasonal level.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Understood. And then secondly, in light of the increased service intensity that you're seeing in the business and the increase vigor with regard to the overall business, can you comment a little bit on your capital spending intensity overall? I mean, we\u2019ve gone from call it a, low to mid-teens capital spend rate as a percentage of revenues, the high single digits?","And I\u2019m just curious given the runway that you see now. Your restraint with regard to adding horsepower for a considerable period of time, your rollout of frac in the future, how is that all interwoven into your capital spending intensity, your capital allocation with regard to new horsepower going forward?","Mark McCollum","","It's a great question, Bill. And one of the things that we are, as Dave, alluded to, yes, we think about our strategy for looking at North America, where we\u2019re keenly focused on. Clearly, several years ago, we accelerated our capital bit quite dramatically anticipating a fairly dramatic turn in North America coming off the bottom of the financial crisis and then seeing the growth opportunities that were available to us in international markets. We felt like that that was a season of time overall because of our focus on returns. We wanted to get back our spending back down to something that was a more reasonable growth rate and really focus the business on capital utilization, asset turnover and return to our sort of an ultimate focus on returns.","As we look at this market today and what maybe happening, I would tell you while we\u2019re still expecting capital expenditures to be $3 billion, I mean, that\u2019s -- I mean, I\u2019ve got a lot of them through sort of keeping a tight grip on the rains in terms of what the opportunity set is out there for the growth of our business. I mean, there is a lot of things that we can do, we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re going to try to maintain that focus on return.","So remember one of the things that we also have available to us, as we do the rollout of Q10s and we\u2019re bringing equipment out of the market itself for reclamation or repositioning into international markets is, in essence, gives us some opportunity to sort of spread our assets, improve our utilization overall that maybe some other businesses don\u2019t have within the capital budget.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thanks very much. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.","Angie Sedita - UBS","","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Dave Lesar","Hi, Angie.","Angie Sedita - UBS","I thought it was interesting your comments first on that you\u2019re seeing frac capacity tighten faster than expected, which you would expect to some degree, but can you give us your thoughts on where the markets frac capacity or frac utilization is today? And then thoughts towards the exit rate at the end of the year, given we still are seeing frac efficiencies, moderate activity growth clearly, and some capacity additions, and where we could be on a frac capacity or utilization frac at the end of the year?","Jeff Miller","Hi, Angie, this is Jeff. Certainly as we look out, we\u2019re seeing some tightening, but what I would say about, broadly capacity is that I don\u2019t have any reason to disagree with some of the numbers that you saw last week. So that be.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Okay. So let\u2019s move to Latin America then; on Mexico, your comments certainly were a little bit more positive on the opening of the country and that you could see something as early as 2015, what do you think, what are you hearing that gives you more confidence and more confidence on that timing?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Couple of things. First is the country is making a lot of the right moves. So as we see the reforms sort of taking shape, clearly they are -- I am impressed and pleased to see the schedule sort of keeping pace. Equally important as we see the contract opportunities in the market that works being lit, being tendered and won, which gives me confidence that the base activity, though we see the transitory sort of slow down in the contracts that were in place. We also see the path to the contracts that are going to take their place.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Okay. And then finally the Q10 pumps, based on your remarks it does appear -- it does sound as if you are not making net additions to your horsepower in the U.S., is that fair that you are still actually adding capacity on the Q10 side but retiring or refurbishing all the capacity?","Jeff Miller","I mean, right now, we are sticking to our same policy. We are not going to comment on our overall capacity additions just for competitive reasons.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Okay. I will turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Dave Lesar","Hey, Jim.","Operator","Jim, please shut your mute button. We will move on to our next question, our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, good morning.","Dave Lesar","Hi, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","I just had a follow-up question. Your forecasting guidance I think speaks to this, but there have been significant investor concerns about the deepwater drilling market and potential utilization declines in conjunction with the prospect for lower international oil company, E&P spending dynamics throughout the course of the year. I know again given the context of your forecast whether or not you can give us some view on IOC spend plans maybe versus NOC or independents and how you see this rolling up into your forecast?","Dave Lesar","Thanks, Kurt. We\u2019ve always called the growth in that market as sort of slow and steady and it\u2019s staying on the pace that we\u2019ve sort of described all along. I won\u2019t comment necessarily on the deepwater drillers, but our view and their view maybe a little bit different around that growth pace. We feel confident about what business that we see sort of over the near term and then clearly contracts that are being left appear to be going to work. So I am confident that from our standpoint, our outlook is still intact and our commitment to outgrow that market by 25% stays intact.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. And just follow-up, I had commentary about the North American market capacity tightening and maybe more quickly than anticipated. What do you see is the potential impact on a global standpoint from pricing because typically when North America get tight, it\u2019s pretty good opportunity to improve pricing on the international front as well, and any sense on that prospect as we head out into the rest of 2014?","Dave Lesar","Well, I think as we -- sort of our experience in the last up-cycle following the financial crisis that potential connection doesn\u2019t always work. We continue to believe that, while there are pockets of opportunity to -- or maybe to adjust our pricing with contracts awarded for specific product service lines, the large mega tenders that come out continue to be very, very competitive. And we don\u2019t anticipate that necessarily changing in a slow and steady growth market over time regardless of what happens in the North American market in the short term.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","Hi, good morning.","Dave Lesar","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","Given some of the volume increases you talked about in North America sort of 30% on a per well basis in your customer mix, can you just talk about the challenges that brings and what you are doing to address it, whether it\u2019d be sand, water, or kind of whatever else on the logistics side?","Dave Lesar","Yes, thanks, Jeff. The increased volumes put a lot of -- not pressure but gives us an opportunity really to use our logistics and infrastructure that we put in place over the last several years. But clearly the ability to deliver the large volumes is crucial to our business and we do that through managing that delivery really from the beginning to the end from the mine to the well side and it\u2019s -- so the takeaway is, yes, we manage it, and yes, we see it as a key component of our advantage.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","And the second quarter in North America, so seasonally Canada obviously takes a step backward, but could you comment on weather risk and how you see it in kind of northern part of the U.S., whether it be the Bakken breakup or what not, just curious how you see that playing out at this point?","Dave Lesar","Yes, the Canada breakup is always an impact. There is no -- that\u2019s always part of the outlook, but in our case that is part of our outlook that\u2019s included in the commitments that we made for next quarter and then beyond in North America. So we continue to be positive on that and really the takeaway, equipment works harder in the lower 48 than it does in Canada, just given that impact to breakup.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","","Any thoughts on the Bakken and just given coming off the very cold weather, do we need to expect very, I mean a normal seasonal impact, better or worse, I mean, any thoughts around the Bakken this quarter?","Jeff Miller","Yeah. I mean, Bakken, I think is back to work. So, I mean, it works it\u2019s way through breakup and don\u2019t have any reason to believe that it\u2019s impacted any differently and it was extremely cold winter but that market knows how to rebound.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Sorry, guys, I\u2019m obviously technically challenged on Monday morning.","Dave Lesar","We already knew that.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Yeah. That's no surprise, no surprise. Let me talk about sustainability if I could? Its great picture, excited about the North American market, a lot of people saying don\u2019t forget there was price fixing litigation last year. So it\u2019s good that you can be excited but we understand why you can\u2019t talk details, so that's fine? But it just strikes me and Jeff, your comments about natural gas, but we all kind of know that volumes have to increase overtime? And I am just wondering how do you guys view the sustainability of growth in the North American market? And I would think that you get paid on volume as much as what gas price is, but Dave to your point, you are not increasing volumes much, maybe that's not the case? But can you talk about the broader five-year outlook for North American activity, the sustainability part of it?","Dave Lesar","Yeah. Thanks, Jim. I mean, a lot of the, if we look out five years, a lot of the structural things in my view are happening that that support the sustainable gas market. If we look at LNG export clearly a positive and its moving the right way, if we look at sort of the uptake on gas and its positioning in the market as long-term, fuel for electricity and then we look at sort of the economy and the upside in this economy, all of those conspire to in my view a sustainable gas market.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","And should we expect to see, I mean, I am looking at the consensus numbers for you guys and your biggest competitors, and 8% to 10% revenue growth seems to be sustainable at least through consensus? Is that -- I don\u2019t want to -- you guys are saying the business is no longer cyclical? But to Dave to your point, is this the momentum leading into a two-year cycle or a five-year cycle or do you all have a thought on that?","Dave Lesar","Yeah. Jim, I mean, its clearly in my view more than a two-year cycle, because as I indicated earlier, we are not getting any help from gas essentially at this point in time. And I have a view on gas, I happen to believe that over the next five to 10 years, the gas market is going to be there and potentially be there in a big way. Have you went outside and the [call] (ph) probably has their own view as to whether I am right or wrong there. But I think that what we are trying to indicate is that if you just look at the liquid side of the business right now that's actually what\u2019s giving us our excitement. And so is it sustainable, yes. Duration, yeah, it is still a cyclical business, but I clearly think that we are looking at something that is going to be turning up for more than two years.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay. And my follow up if I could. On the mature fields into the business you guys have mentioned several times that you probably have to make some acquisitions to get to where your guidance at your Analyst Meeting was and obviously, those are around pumps of all different kinds and chemistry of all different kinds? Should we expect to see some continuing level of M&A over the next couple years since or could it come in big burst? I am just trying to think of not who you would buy or what you would buy, but how you would go about doing it over the next couple years?","Dave Lesar","Well, I think, the honest answer is, why we would always love to do some big bites. It takes two to tango, right. You\u2019ve got to have those opportunities in front of you and in the absence those opportunities, the way I described our M&A strategy as we play small ball, right. You are going to that's ultimately can win the game and so we are out there constantly keeping our M&A pipeline full of prospects that address the strategic technologies and niches that we want to feel and keep a constant dialogue.","Now all of those will come to fruition but enough of those you know along the way are filling up the prospects that can ultimately get us there. We would love to have some bigger deals. We have the balance sheet. We think we have the management team, the ability to integrate in a way that can make that very successful but those have been few and far between.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Thank you. Mark, are they any chances of any adjustments to your Brazilian contracts and if the answer to that is, no, when do you expect them to be re-bid and when might that take effect?","Jeff Miller","Yeah. Thanks, Jim. This is Jeff. The answer to question, well, I am not going to comment on the specific discussions with the client, but I am confident that we work through those during the current year. So as we -- some point this year we will see some relief there and certainly going into \u201915 it would look different.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Okay. Secondly, another question about South American country, are you seeing or have any seen any improvement in your receivable situation from PdVSA and have you at all curtailed shipments of product or services to PdVSA because of that?","Mark McCollum","We saw a significant improvement in our receivable position at the end of the fourth quarter. This quarter, it didn\u2019t necessarily improve but I think that was driven probably more by an expansion of our operation there in Venezuela versus lack of payment but still is slower than we would like it to be. We continue to work with our customer there. They are trying to find an arrangement that\u2019s mutually beneficial. But I think that at this point in time we\u2019ll take a long-term view of Venezuela. We\u2019ll continue to be constructive about that market think it can work for us and we\u2019re continuing to invest and operate there to help them achieve their goals.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Okay, good, Mark. And one final question about two categories of companies and how you see sort of this category of E&P spending, one is the majors we\u2019ve -- I mean, the majors budgets if you add them up are actually slightly lower in 2014 versus \u201813 and they make up about 26% of spending. And then we are also seeing at least in the budgets a significant slowdown coming out of Asia Pacific companies, particularly the NOCs out of China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia. When do you expect that this condition is going to change and if so when do you think it could change?","Mark McCollum","So challenging question, your second part is when it necessarily will change? Again I think that our overall view of the market has been slow and steady. And we have supported commodity prices ultimately when things will change will really relate to the supply and demand balance. Right now, there everything seems to be well and balance and I think as the economic, macroeconomic indicators improve globally, demand will grow then the need for supply will start growing and I think accelerate activity.","The first part of the question on IOC and IOC is the part of our overall portfolio. They are an important part but they\u2019re less than 25% as a percentage of our total revenues. I mean, we -- and I would also say that even though their relative budgets have stayed flat, what we see internally that they\u2019ve adjusted some of that spending toward E&P and away from infrastructure this year. So the overall budget totals that they get may not be necessarily indicative of what we see them spending. And we expect that particularly in areas like the Gulf of Mexico that spending will be creeping up as the year goes -- goes by.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Okay. Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Becker - Bank of America","Thanks. I will stick with Latin America. Mark, you\u2019ve mentioned expectations for slightly higher margins in 2Q versus 1Q pretty flat for the full year. What assumptions are you making regarding work in Brazil and the signing of the blanket contract with PEMEX in that guidance? And maybe, if you could help us think about the range of outcomes in terms of margins related to those factors?","Mark McCollum","Okay. Just sort of, I guess, to reiterate the guidance, we are expecting that revenues will be slightly up but that margins will be flat in Q2 but that they will be increasing over the rest of the year so that when you look at the total 2013 -- I'm sorry 2014 year, it will be on balance the same as 2013 was, both from a revenue standpoint and margin standpoint. So that's the overall guidance. So that anticipates a higher margin in the back part of the year than we\u2019re currently experiencing. The forecast that I gave you for Q2 on the blanket contract assumes Q2 more but probably later in the quarter versus earlier. And so it\u2019s large impact will be back half of the year versus for Q2.","Doug Becker - Bank of America","Okay. And with relates -- as it relates to Brazil just that the contracts stays in place as is, is that their underlying assumption?","Dave Lesar","Yes, it is. We have not anticipated any kind of contract reform in Brazil over the course of the year. So if something happens there earlier than toward the end of the year than that would be beneficial for us.","Doug Becker - Bank of America","Got it. And then Dave, you did mentioned that March saw record revenues in North America. Can we get any sense for just how much better March was, whether its in terms of revenue, profitability compared to January and February?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, this is Jeff. I mean there was a solid exit rates and on the basis of that we feel confident about the forecast we\u2019ve laid out for you and also see the path to the commitment that we\u2019ve made for 2014, which was adding the 200 basis points in North America.","Doug Becker - Bank of America","Maybe another way of approaching it, just any quantification of what the weather impact was in North American margins in the first quarter?","Dave Lesar","Maybe to help, when we gave our guidance at the end of the first quarter -- fourth quarter about what would happen in Q1. We highlighted that we expected that there would be some pricing degradation that we had to fight against because of contract rollover as well as weather. And I think that some of the pricing was basically anticipated but I think that the weather and the knock-on impacts of the weather and logistic impacts and stuff like that were not anticipated to be as bad as they were.","And so that\u2019s probably, and I guess, as much as I want to give but again looking at March exit rates, they were very strong, very solid and that gives us high confidence for not only just Q2 but the rest of the year.","Doug Becker - Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much. My question relates to the Middle East. As we look at the margins in the Middle East in the first quarter versus last year's first quarter, they are relatively flat. Could you talk about that given what's going on in Saudi Arabia and UAE, like I would have expected the margins to be year-over-year much better? Is there anything special going on there, is it all Iraq or equipment relocation that's impacting first quarter?","Dave Lesar","Yeah. Thanks, Waqar. The Middle East growth is solid. But don\u2019t forget, we have won a number of projects in the Middle East then we\u2019re mobilizing for those, including in Saudi Arabia. And so what you\u2019re seeing is some of the sorting out of that activity. That said, the takeaway is we are very confident about the business in the Middle East and expect to see strengthening there.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs ","Okay. Could we -- where could the margins in the Middle East head to? I know you've given guidance for all of Eastern Hemisphere. But just looking at Middle East on its own, any guidance in terms of revenues and margins for not just 2014, maybe longer term as well?","Dave Lesar","Waqar, we are not going to provide any guidance specifically on the Middle East. Middle East\/Asia is our reportable region. If you look at it, it tends to be, have higher margins and we anticipate it will have higher growth than the average of Eastern Hemisphere overall but otherwise, we are going to stay with our Eastern Hemisphere guidance.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Okay. We\u2019ve heard from some of your peers saying that like rig count growth could be 17%, 18% in the Middle East area. Is that your thinking as well?","Dave Lesar","We have no reason to dispute their estimates on rig count growth as well.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs ","Okay. And just one finally on the labor, we hear that labor is pretty tight, not just in Permian but other places too. Do you see that having any impact on work or the industry\u2019s ability to perform work this year?","Dave Lesar","No. I mean, this is really where we\u2019ve build the machine. It\u2019s able to hire people. We know how to do that. We\u2019ve seen this sort of tightness in labor before. So, we may see some increased costs but the ability to execute and deliver the people, I\u2019m quite confident that we will do that.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs ","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Dave Lesar","Sam, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our final question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now opened.","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave or Jeff, have you started to see a turn in the appetite for shale technology, particularly by the domestic E&Ps? Just from a 20,000 foot level, it appears that the domestic industry is just running so hard right now, that customers are simply demanding more and more of the conventional services. But obviously you have a much more detailed perspective than we do, so wanted to see if you're starting to sense a turn in that mentality?","Jeff Miller","Yeah. This is Jeff. There is a strong appetite for better technology and that\u2019s really the crux for most of the conversations, I have with customers today is around how to make more barrels and what technology will allow them to do that. And that's really what our CYPHER suite is all about, is how to frac and how to drill to make more barrels. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing that increase in appetite so. And that\u2019s really across the piece. So the takeaway is yes, there is more activity but every application of better technology in that higher volume environment is able to even make, create more value for our customers.","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein","And do you think that's a product of where we stand with the evolution of shale, more in the development phase today? Is it a product of the tightness -- emerging tightness for people and equipment, if you can comment on any change in your sales strategy and whether that's having an impact as well?","","Dave Lesar","Well, let me comment on this place. We are in the cycle and clearly as the client goes into development, there is such a premium on making more barrels out of that existing asset that I think that\u2019s driving some of that appetite. I won't comment on our sales strategy necessarily other than to say, we really like the suite of tools that we have in the marketplace right now and the benefit that it\u2019s delivering for our customers.","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments.","Kelly Youngblood","Okay, Sam. I think we\u2019re ready to close the call. I just want to thank everybody on behalf of the management team for participating today. You can go ahead and close the call.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."],"10922":["Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Kelly Youngblood - VP, IR","Dave Lesar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Christian Garcia - Acting Chief Financial Officer","Jeff Miller - President","Mark McCollum - Chief Integration Officer","Analysts","Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities","Sean Meakim - JPMorgan","David Anderson - Barclays","Angie Sedita - UBS","James West - Evercore","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Scott Gruber - Citigroup","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Dan Boyd - BMO Capital Markets","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Operator","Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's Web site for seven days.","Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer, will also join us during the question-and-answer portion of the call.","During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory review, today we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.","Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. And unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release, which can be found on our Web site.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe, as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices, and the pressure that their own shareholders are putting on them. Considering the difficult headwinds that were working against us, I'm actually very pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter, especially for our Eastern Hemisphere operations.","Now, let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion declined 6% sequentially, outperforming our largest peer. I'm very pleased with the resilience of our international business, where we again outperformed our largest peer on both a sequential and year-over-year basis for both revenue and margins. This demonstrates once again that we are not getting distracted as we go through the merger process, and I'm confident that from what we are seeing in the marketplace, this is the same for Baker Hughes.","And despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to maintain operating margins due to a relentless focus on cost management. As expected, North America revenue and operating income declined further as a result of lower activity levels and pricing pressure. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the peak that we saw last November, our completions related activity has declined approximately 18%, relative to a 58% reduction in the U.S. land rig count.","This clearly demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn, and it positions us well for when the market recovers. And finally, we took an additional restructuring charge to reflect current market conditions. But let me remind you, as we approach the finish line on the Baker Hughes acquisition, we continue to maintain North American infrastructure well beyond current market needs, incurring a cost which we would have otherwise eliminated. This cost impacted North America margins by approximately 400 basis points in the third quarter.","Now, turning to operations, in North America prices continue to erode during the third quarter, impacting the total services industry profitability, obviously including ourselves. We believe these prices are clearly unsustainable, but as we have been saying all along, pricing cannot stabilize until activity stabilizes. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, visibility is murky at best. Based on current feedback, we believe most operators have exhausted their 2015 budgets, and will take extended breaks, starting as early as thanksgiving. Therefore our activity levels could drop substantially in the last five weeks of the year.","In my 22 years in this business, I've never seen a market where we've had less near-term visibility. In reality, we are managing this business on a near real-time basis, customer-by-customer, district-by-district, product line-by-product line, and, yes, even crew-by-crew. But you know me, and you know our management team. Nobody knows the North America land market better than us. We are the execution company, and we know what leverage to pull to make this market work.","Our view is that the first quarter could end up being a mirror image of the fourth quarter. So, just as the fourth quarter is facing a steep drop-off post Thanksgiving, we expect to see a slow ramp up beginning in January, and improving from there, suggesting that the first quarter could be the bottom of this cycle. If you pull back and look at the full year 2016 and compare it to 2015, you could envision a similar mirror image, directionally a slow start and then perhaps picking up speed in the second half of the year.","Now, there obviously are a number of moving parts in North America, and I'm not confident enough yet to call the exact shape on this recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. Until then, we will continue to execute on our strategy, and we will be watching the same external data points that you do: What is happening to oil production? What is the rig count doing? What is happening with operators' cash flows, and how are re-determinations impacting our customers' credit lines? And in addition, we have our own proprietary internal metrics that we will follow.","We will continue to adjust our cost structure to market conditions, but to me it does not make sense to reduce costs or infrastructure to reflect expected fourth quarter's reduced activity levels. Instead, we are positioning our North America land business for future success, and to ultimately outperform the industry as the market recovers.","Internationally, I remain very happy with where our business is today. The international markets have held up better than North America, but they are not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. We did experience lower prices during the quarter, but in anticipation of these reductions we aggressively went after further cost adjustments. And although we had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency.","Internationally, for 2016, we expect to see a continuation of trends from 2015. Land-based activity, including mature fields should be the most resilient, while we expect offshore to see additional project delays.","Now I'd like to provide you with an update on the Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced the second tranche of businesses to be marketed for sale in connection with the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and we expect that marketing process to begin shortly. On the first tranche of divestitures, we have now moved into the negotiation process. On the regulatory front, during the quarter, the timing agreement with the DoJ was extended by three weeks, and accordingly, Halliburton and Baker Hughes agreed to extend the closing date to December 16th.","Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with completing the required filings, and obtaining the necessary approvals. Specific to the European Commission, we are working cooperatively to respond to their information requests, and expect to resubmit our filing in the near future, which will start the formal review process.","Let me be very clear. We remain confident this deal will be approved. We continue to target a 2015 close, but the transaction could move into 2016, which is allowed under the merger agreement. We are enthusiastic about, and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction and achieving our annual cost synergy target of nearly $2 billion.","I want to be clear, this $2 billion will be on top of any cost reductions that we've made to date. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination, and what it will provide to the shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil field services company, combining our highly complementary suites of services and products into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost effective solutions to our customers.","Now, let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?","Christian Garcia","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our third quarter results to the second quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of 5.6 billion represented a 6% decline, while operating income declined 21% to 506 million. North America led the decline as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds.","For our international business, third quarter revenue declined by 5%, while operating income margins remained unchanged to second quarter levels. The impact of price negotiations with our customers in the first half has been offset primarily by a proactive reduction in operational cost.","In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue declined by 4% with a similar decline in operating income of 3%. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were partially offset by increased activity in the UAE and Iraq.","Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw our third quarter revenue decline by 7%, with a decrease in operating income of 9%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by lower activity in Angola and East Africa.","Latin America revenue and operating income both declined 4% during the quarter, driven primarily by reduced activity in Mexico. Partially offsetting this decline was improved unconventional activity levels in Argentina.","Moving to North America, revenue declined 7% with operating income at near breakeven levels. Reduced activity levels throughout U.S. land were accompanied by further price reductions across the business, especially in the pumping-related product lines.","Globally, the continued activity declines and pricing pressures led us to take additional actions to adjust the cost structure. As a result, we incurred an additional restructuring charge of 257 million after tax in the third quarter consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As this market plays out, we will evaluate our operations and make further adjustments as required.","Our corporate and other expense totaled 58 million for the quarter, and we estimate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in a bit higher at 29% due to the impact of gains from our foreign currency hedging program. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter.","Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance by an additional 200 million to $2.4 billion for the year. This represents a 27% year-over-year decline. However, our Q10 program remains intact as we derive significant cost savings from its deployment, and the Q10 provides us the ability to address the higher completions intensity experienced by the industry.","Finally, let me give you some comments on our operations outlook starting with our international business. We believe the typical seasonal uptick in year end sales will be minimal this year, as customer budgets are exhausted, and may not fully offset continued pricing pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat to modestly lower, compared to the third quarter.","In North America, the prospects of reduced borrowing capacity for operators, and a prolonged holiday season make the fourth quarter challenging and difficult to predict. So far, the average horizontal rig count is down a little less than 10% from the third quarter average. If these headwinds play out, we estimate that the fourth quarter average horizontal rig count could drop about 15% to 20% sequentially. We expect our North America revenues and margins to decline, but we anticipate sequential decrementals to be only in the mid-teens due to our cost reduction efforts.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Christian, and good morning everyone. To begin, I would like to take this opportunity to commend our operational teams for once again executing to our playbook. I am telling you we are not distracted. I particularly like to recognize the performance of our international employees for staying dead focused on our business in a very difficult market.","Now, what\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is North America. So let me give you a little more granularity on North America by division. Our drilling-related businesses have been much more resilient than our completions related businesses. In fact, drilling division margins increased this quarter to 10%, and this is including the 400 basis point impact of the added cost that we are carrying in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition.","Obviously, the most stressed part of our business is pumping. Now, this is the business that we know the best. It\u2019s the business that recovers the fastest. It\u2019s the business that recovers the most sharply, and we know what that path looks like. It looks like this. It looks like staying with the fairway players in the basins that we know. It does not mean chasing every stake. It looks like staying with the customers that are loyal, even if that means working at a price that we don\u2019t like, collaborating on our path forward that lowers their costs per BOE to a place where we can both be successful, and it looks like staying with the overall strategy to focus on long-term returns; meaning, we see a path to profitability.","This is a very simple solution, but simple does not mean easy. So if you are looking for a silver lining here, the most competitive piece of the business, pumping, is the one that we know the best. It\u2019s the business that recovers the fastest and the most sharply, and you can be confident that we have the team that gets it done.","Last time we reported earnings, oil was in the upper 50s, and the outlook was cautiously optimistic. Since then, we saw oil drop into the 30s, which I can tell you elicited an immediate and visceral reaction from our customer base. And as I described at a conference during the quarter, the rig count followed the oil price down soon thereafter.","Now, this has caused us to continue to look carefully and strategically at the business and how we're structured to execute. In the short-term, we further adjusted our operations. Recent actions we\u2019ve taken include partnering with our suppliers to find better ways to work together in these tougher times. Leveraging our logistics infrastructure, including higher rate usage of unit trains, and stacking additional equipment during the quarter where we either were unable to make an acceptable return, or cannot see a path to acceptable returns, and finally, rightsizing the business to reflect current activity levels.","Unfortunately, since the beginning of the year, market conditions have forced us to reduce our global headcount by over 21%. Now, these are always tough decisions affecting great people, but they are simply decisions that we have to make.","Consistent with maintaining our service delivery model to obtain the cost synergy savings in the Baker acquisition, we\u2019ve taken a bottoms-up look at our service processes, including comparing our current structure to previous similarly-sized markets. This is an examination of how we work. Those things absolutely require to deliver our value proposition, which also means stripping away everything that is not required. For example, in the third quarter, we eliminated an entire level of management in North America. In my view, this is not a one-time initiative. By clarifying and controlling how we execute, we can retain this efficiency, these cost savings as the market recovers.","We have a two-pronged strategy. The first part being to control what we control in the short-term. And the second is looking beyond the cycle and preparing for the recovery. Q10 is our great example. The cost savings we derive from these new generation fleets is substantial compared to legacy equipment; 25% less capital on location, 30% less labor on site, and up to 50% less maintenance cost. Q10 spreads now represent close to 50% of our fleet, and we should be near 60% by the end of the year.","At the same time, those legacy assets that are still deployed are being strategically placed to maximize our potential in locations, or functions that maximize their cost effectiveness. ","While the industry is seeing average fleet sizes increase by 15% to 20% over the last two years due to rise in completions intensity, our average fleet size has been essentially flat as a result of the more efficient Q10s.","So when coupled with our logistics platform, we believe Halliburton offers the lowest total cost of service to our customers at any point in the cycle. We are pleased with our customer portfolio. Both in North America and on an international basis, we\u2019ve aligned with customers who have strong balance sheets and assets in the fairway positions in the basins. These are the customers that have better well economics, and are continuing to work through the downturn, and are engaged in the important cost per barrel discussions.","Improving a customer's cost per barrel of oil equivalent is core to our value proposition. This is why we continue to invest in technology, and our emphasis is two basic tenants. One is increasing reliability, eliminating moving parts, simplifying designs, and helping eliminate nonproductive time at the well site. The second is making better wells. Products like AccessFrac, CoreVault, and DecisionSpace help customers identify, and access the sweet spots of their reservoirs. And more importantly, these products are seeing increased uptake during this downturn.","Adoption of DecisionSpace is up double digits from 2014, for example. And the usage of AccessFrac has grown more than 60% over the last year. There is no question that this is a challenging market today. But our playbook remains the same. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. And we are managing through the downturn by drawing on our Management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. In the long term, we anticipate that unconventionals, mature fields, and deepwater will offer the most significant growth opportunities.","That hasn\u2019t changed, although each of these markets faces economic challenges right now. Ultimately, when this market recovers, we believe North America will respond the quickest, and offer the greatest upside. And Halliburton is best positioned to outperform. ","Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks.","Dave Lesar","Okay, to sum up. We continue to make progress with the Baker Hughes acquisition, and we are diligently focused on finalizing all regulatory matters, completing the divestiture process, and preparing for integration activities after closing the deal. We are managing the downturn by executing our two-pronged strategy, getting down to our purest form of cost, while retaining the flexibility to grow in our usual disciplined way, as activity levels recover.","For the fourth quarter, there's a lot of uncertainty as we approach the holiday season. But we believe that customer budgets will reload in the first quarter, and anticipate activity to ramp up in the second half of 2016. Looking ahead, we're not going to try to call the exact shape of recovery. But we do believe that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. And when that recovery comes, we expect North America will offer the greatest upside, and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way.","And finally, there is no doubt that this is going to be a bumpy road. But history would tell you that we have outperformed in these kinds of markets, turning them into a new catalyst for growth. We are the execution company. So you can be sure that whatever the market gives us, we will take it, and then take some more.","Now, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","Thank you, good morning. I wanted to start off by asking about your international margins, where you continue to put up good results in spite of the downturn? Could you give us a little more color, first of all, on the resiliency of your margins, and what you are doing there to keep those at relatively flat levels of 2Q, and year-over-year? And also, how should we think about margin progression internationally in 2016 with pricing continuing to come down and offshore activity probably going to be weak again?","Jeff Miller","Yes, thanks, Jud, this is Jeff. Well, look, really these guys internationally are absolutely on top of their business. So they are, you know, as you say, continuing to outperform our competitors in a very tough market, and it really gets down to a couple of things. They are winning the right contracts and they are winning quite a few important contracts in markets that are important to them, and also managing the heck out of their costs. And so -- and this is a team that I fully expect will continue to outperform even when the market starts to recover.","Christian Garcia","Jud, this is Christian. Let me take the question -- your question on 2016. If you look at how our margins behaved on a year-to-date basis, our international margins actually had improvement despite revenues lower by 11%. So we actually had incrementals this year.","If fact, we are compressed with a margin gap between us and our largest competitor by about 200 basis points in a scenario where our revenues declined less. Now, in 2016, it is unrealistic for us to think that we can continue to see our margin increase or even remain at these levels over the next year, given that we are going to continue to deal with a tough environment.","Now, in terms of margin progressions or decrementals, it would be very dependent on the magnitude of the declines between activity and pricing, and it is way too difficult to say at this point, but I will tell you we will continue to aspire to continue to outperform our competition.","Jud Bailey","All right, thanks for that. And then I guess my follow-up, maybe for Dave, if I could just follow up on your comment to clarify the mirror image that you see maybe from 1Q relative to 4Q. Do you think we can actually see revenues rebound modestly, it sounds like in the first quarter. And if so, did the margins slip down a little bit more in the first quarter, or do you think they can hold stable with where you come in, in the fourth quarter?","Dave Lesar","I think it really depends. Obviously, there has to be, and there will be a budget reload that takes place in Q1. I think the big question mark is how fast do our customers go back to work once they do reload their budgets, given off what we think we will be a relatively low rig count volume in the latter part of the quarter, especially in December. So it really depends on the bounce back, but the cash will be there. And I think one of the things that our customers demonstrate, and believe me, we love all our customers. If they have cash they are going to spend it. And so, really, it depends on how quickly they want to ramp up, but I do think that as we look at the potentiality of Q1, if there is a slow ramp up that gets a little better toward the end of the first quarter, I think that could be the bottom from a margin standpoint then at that point in time.","And then my comment about sort of the rest of 2016 for North America looking a bit like a mirror image of 2015, if you get off the mark slow on your spend, then I think it really does come a little stronger in the back half of the year, and that gives us some hope at this point in time.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Thank you, good morning.","Dave Lesar","Good morning.","Sean Meakim","I was hoping, Dave, just to get your perspective, maybe from Jeff as well. Looking at, we've got call it may be at least half or more than half of the pumping equipment on the sidelines these days. Do you have any sense of how much of that equipment is unlikely to come off the fence once there is a call on it? And does the duration of the downturn increase or increase what that could look like in terms of attrition?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Sean. If we look at the amount of horsepower that's idled right now, just on the side lines, about half of it is on the sidelines today in terms of stacked equipment. And that\u2019s equipment that\u2019s not getting any maintenance, and it's being cannibalized for parts.","The other factor that we see now, service intensity continues to increase actually on a per well basis. And so, that\u2019s yet again harder on the equipment that is working. So if we look at what\u2019s stacked today, we think about half of that equipment stacked today will not be ultimately serviceable. So that maybe in their estimates four to six million horsepower out of the market in \u201916, and that\u2019s very realistic. If we go back and think about 2013 Q4, we had talked about a 30% or so overhang of equipment then, and that capacity overage narrowed to 5% by the end of Q1 of \u201914. So that didn\u2019t happen in 90 days. That happened throughout that downturn period. So, the takeaway is that\u2019s exactly why we are committed to Frac of the Future, and having equipment in place, it's able to perform in this environment.","Sean Meakim","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. I guess just a follow-up on North America. What do you think E&Ps need to see in terms of not just higher oil prices but their perceived sustainability of those higher levels? And if we don't see, maybe the number $60-plus WTI early in 2016, is there a point at which you think that starts to put a second half recovery at risk?","Dave Lesar","I think you can -- this is Dave, you can argue all the macroeconomics, where is the breakeven price point. I think it's \u2013- there's really actually, I think, a different way you need to think about the customer base in North America, especially the independent customer base. And that\u2019s essentially with the high decline curves that exist on these unconventional plays. They are really are in drill or die mode.","So if you go a year without drilling a well, and your production starts to turnover, you are going to have to start drilling or you are going to have to take your infrastructure apart that you\u2019ve built up as a company. So I think that as we get to the end of the year, if these guys have money, they are going to drill it up, and that\u2019s just the fact that it is.","Now, oil is at 60, I think the banks will be more comfortable with extending lines of credit with the debt positions that are there, but I think that the real key is going to be the production declines you see, and when these companies get to the point where they have to start drilling or they have to start dismantling their companies, and they are not going to want to do that.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question from David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","David Anderson","Thanks. So in regards to your cost control efforts, you mentioned on the call, removing an entire level of management in North America. That got me thinking here can you may be expand a bit in terms of what this redundancy was, and perhaps maybe with some of the other opportunities to remove fixed costs from your system?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks. As we look at how we do business, we get a lot of opportunities to clarify precisely what are those moving parts. And so as we look at what\u2019s absolutely required to deliver in terms of span and control, and oversight of process execution, it became clear that there was a service line component in North America, an entire layer that we were able to remove. This is really -- we can do that, because of the discipline that we have around how we execute process. And as that has continued to tighten, we\u2019ve actually seen at into the downturn, service quality getting better, not worse. And that\u2019s unusual actually going into a market like this. I attribute that to the discipline around execution. And so that then allows us to remove that layer as we -- so that\u2019s that that thought.","If we think about other opportunities, we are constantly evaluating things that we can do to take cost out of our business, and this is in North America and the rest of the world in terms of maintenance process, value engineering exercises, kaizen events. So we are highly engaged in looking at those opportunities.","David Anderson","So as it relates to -- as you're saying the nearly $2 billion in cost synergies after closing Baker Hughes, I was just curious if that, what you just talked about, impacts that $2 billion number at all? Obviously market conditions have deteriorated. So I assume there are some give and takes around that figure. Can you maybe provide a little bit of color around maybe some of the expectations of how this changed at all or maybe are there more opportunities or is there maybe a little bit less opportunities considering the market has shifted obviously?","Dave Lesar","No, I mean we are absolutely confident in the synergies of nearly $2 billion that we\u2019ve talked about, and I say that because those aren\u2019t synergies associated with necessarily the market-related taking out a layer at Halliburton that we were talking about. These are more around changing basic ways that we work that then drive meaningful, sustainable savings. And they range -\u2013 won't give you too much granularity on them, but it is the way that we, for example, plug into North America's supply chain being an example of that. I mean, that is a very valuable asset that immediately allows cost savings that are very sustainable. We can think about the same things in technology in a lot places around the company, where changing the way we work together is actually going to eliminate that, the bigger piece of cost.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, guys, and good job on international. It's pretty impressive. So if we think about North America, and if we go back to actually about 2012, when we had significant overcapacity and pressure pumping, and you think about going into 2013 and 2014 we had no movement in price, but you saw steady increases in your margin on activity gains, and increasing utilization. So if we think about the cycle, and then Jeff you made the reference that you see the path for a return of profitability in North America, so if we think about this cycle going into 2016 and 2017, have you guys have done some work to think through where you need to be on utilization or even a rig count to get back into those high single-digit margins, and even move back into the double-digit margins, could you then see high single-digit margins at 1,100 to 1,200 rig count, assuming we get there in 2017?","Dave Lesar","Thanks, Angie. Yes, I mean the playbook as I described is as simple, but not easy. And it means that we stay with the customers that can be efficient -- that want to be efficient, and that are in the fairways. We stay in the basins where the efficiency matters, and by matters, I mean it always matters, but it matters the most to us when it creates a critical mass that allows us to leverage up on the volume and take advantage of our lowest unit cost delivery.","And then finally, there's clients with the sense of urgency. And by sense of urgency, I mean the urgency to keep the equipment working, which ultimately does drive outsized profitability for Halliburton. And so with activity, I see the same the path as we saw before. That hasn\u2019t changed at all.","Angie Sedita","All right. So your thought would be, we could move back to those single-digit margins, high single-digit margins even in a muted recovery, in 2016 going into 2017, even double-digit margins?","Dave Lesar","Yes, absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James West from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey, good morning guys.","Dave Lesar","Hi, James. Good morning.","James West","David or Jeff, you guys talk to your customers every single day. And I'm curious about how those conversations are evolving, given that the vast majority of them are facing production declines next year. And, Dave, I know you highlighted you either dismantle your business or you drill, but is there some percentage of the companies out there that are willing to allow production declines in '16, and not get after it?","Dave Lesar","So, I think it really depends on what their bankers are going to let them do or whether their stock price has reasonably well held up in this market. Obviously, some of our customers had their share prices just crushed, and some have pulled back, but also to the point where they do believe that maybe they can go back in the market for equity if there is a more optimistic view of where WTI prices are. I think the customer discussions are really -- we\u2019re going to wait and see right now, but we are going to reload our capital for next year.","Some of them are talking about getting back to work as early as January, coming off a Q4 lull, and some, I think, are going to take a bit of a wait and see, but I think very, very few of them, and certainly I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a single discussion where the customer are going to let themselves get into a position of a meaningful decline in production before they figure out a way to start drilling again.","And then there is another group of customers out there that really view that there is a subset of the customer base that will not get access to money, that will see a decline, that have good acreage, and they are going to be absolutely juicy takeover candidates at that point. So I think it's just we just got to wait and see the -- these re-determinations are going on, and it looks, generally to me, like it\u2019s a sort of kick-the-can-down-a-road approach that's being taken at this point. But that really just pushes the day of reckoning into sort of the first quarter of next year. But the reality is that the strong customers are going to survive. They are going to have money, and they\u2019re going to drill at some point next year.","James West","Got it. And then a follow-up for me on North America; pricing, obviously visibility is not great, so pricing is still a little sloppy here. But at what point do you say, all right, enough is enough, we're not going to go down further, or I guess the flipside is the attrition rate is picking up pretty quickly with your smaller competitors. At what point can pricing does not drop because the competition has basically gone away?","Jeff Miller","Yes, well, the -- yes, when we look at -- I won't give you a price, James, on the call, but what I will tell you is that we look at a number of factors when we look at customers challenging as it is right now. And so, I\u2019ll give you not the price, but I will talk about the factors. So we absolutely look at the efficiency as clearly a component of how we look at pricing. It\u2019s also again customers and basins where we not only see resilience, and customers able to execute. So it\u2019s not so much a number though we have taken equipment, and we have that equipment in 2015 when we got into situations where it simply did not make sense to put equipment to work.","Dave Lesar","Yes, I guess let me just add to that. I mean there is the point that, yes, we have walked away from work and are walking away from work every day. However, there are some key customers as Jeff said in key basins that have been very loyal to us, and we want to stay loyal to them. We know they are going to survive. We know they have good assets. We know they are going to get a budget reload, and we know that they want to take advantage of the services pricing that's out there today, even if I don\u2019t like that service pricing, it is there. It\u2019s a fact of the market. This is a long-term game we are in. These are long-term customers we have. We typically make good money from them in good times, and I\u2019m not going to walk away from them in the kind of times we are in today because it will pay off in the long run, and I think that\u2019s in my view the smart way to approach this.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Thank you. Jeff, or Dave, can you just comment a little bit and\/or question with regard to you've given a pretty Darwinian outlook for the fourth quarter in North America, but D&E so outperformed that expectations in the third quarter. Do we see similar resilience in the fourth quarter, or how should we think about that? I mean, C&P is clear, but how should we think about D&E for North America in Q4?","Jeff Miller","I think the -- Bill, this is Jeff. Q4 right now is murky across the piece, and I think it's the unrealistic -- if clients stop working at the thanksgiving, if we look back to 2012, there was significant slowdown around thanksgiving that sort of continue through to the New Year. It would be hard to imagine that D&E is immune to the same activity slowdown. That said, although what it does emphasize is sort of the bifurcation in the marketplace, and how stressed pressure pumping is today. And that\u2019s why I get back to -- and I have a lot of confidence in our team, and our team knows how to manage through market like this.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And question with regard to -- I think I heard you say $2.4 billion in CapEx for 2015, and how should we think about free cash flow generation and working capital harvest for the next few quarters?","Christian Garcia","For the next few quarters, our year-to-date cash flows has been impacted by a couple of things, Macondo legacy payment with restructuring and acquisition-related cost. But if you look at our historical seasonality in cash generation, we typically do not generate a lot of cash in the third quarter anyway. But we generate the majority of our cash for the year in the fourth quarter. So we anticipate that our historical seasonality will hold true for this year, and expect to generate cash in the fourth quarter. So in terms of CapEx, as we pointed out, 2.4 billion took out another 200 million, but as we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we are still committed to the Q10 program.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Yes, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I had one on the agreement that you guys executed with BlackRock to execute refracs in the US. Can you just provide an update on that? What's been the reception from the E&P community, and has capital been put to work?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Scott. The reality is this is a very small piece of the market certainly today with effect to refract. That said, we are finalizing terms on a deal under that arrangement. I think the real story -- the real and probably more important story is around the technology, the diversion capability, and how that applies not only to refrac and to new wells and how that\u2019s able to improve production to make better wells.","The other thing that when we look at refrac is we see it really more as a portfolio approach to asset management, meaning, it\u2019s in the toolbox, it\u2019s something important that clients can use to better manage pressure in the field, pressure sinks, and the relationship between parent wells and daughter wells. So, the takeaway though is that the technology and the funding are both in place and we are well prepared for that as -- or to the extent that it does develop.","Scott Gruber","And as you look out into 2016, do you see an environment where pumping demand could do better than the horizontal rig count for the market as a whole, given some incremental refrac demand and incremental demand to draw down on the drilled but uncompleted?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean when we talk about -- when I think about drilled but uncompleted is arguably deferred revenue, and it makes sense to do when rigs are contract and a company is trying to converse cash. Nevertheless, those are there in the ground and they are ready source cash flow, and so, I think they may end up a little bit uncoupled from the rig count, per se, just because it\u2019s there and needs to be done.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Tillery","Hi, good morning. Christian, I just have one question around the near-term. You talked about North America relatively harsh year-end, but also relatively shallow decremental margins. So I'm just curious how you manage costs in the near-term to achieve those shallow decrementals.","Christian Garcia","That\u2019s right, decrementals are 67% in the third quarter and we are guiding to a decrementals in the mid-teens in Q4. Well, the reason for that is most of the cost reductions that we did were towards the end of the quarter, savings of which did not have a material impact in the third quarter. So we expect those savings will be in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s why we expect to see a drop in decrementals quarter-over-quarter.","Jeff Tillery","Thank you. And then just you talked a little bit prospectively about the international margin outlook, but I was just curious of the pricing reductions internationally that have been agreed to to-date, how much of that would you say was realized in the Q3 results? Is it more than half, less than half; just looking for a ballpark?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean in terms of -- these are negotiations that seem be that are ongoing, and so, round one arguably occur early in the cycle, actually much was stressed even at 100 in deep water. And so, this has been an ongoing discussion of both negotiation and re-tendering of work.","So what we talked about in the last quarter probably a quarter has been -- a quarter to a half has been absorbed during the current quarter though as long as we see pricing -- commodity pricing, where it is, and delays in terms of activity, I wholly expect we will continue to see this.","Now, the better discussion that we have with clients is around how to do drive efficiency and how to use those things that are in our value proposition around increasing reliability and reducing uncertainty to help lower their overall cost, and I would say I am pleased that we are having more discussions that look like that with clients as they realize that they reached kind of limits around what\u2019s available in the service sector.","Dave Lesar","Yes, I think -- and let me just add a little bit more color to that, because I think it\u2019s important to sort of sit back and understand where does the customer have a leverage point in these negotiations. So if you go back to a -- let\u2019s say U.S. horizontal unconventional well, and it costs a dollar, about -- say about $0.70 of that dollar is focused on the completion, particularly the frac. So that\u2019s naturally where customers have gone in terms of the pressure to reduce cost.","If you go to an offshore kind of a project, the cost is really in the E&C cost, it\u2019s in the day rate and the drilling rig, and other services work that we do is maybe 20% of that. And so, the leverage point that customers have gone for there, and obviously you all follow the sector, has been to the day rates on the drilling contractors and to the E&C companies with a discussion with us on services rates, but we are not the sort of cost tail wagging the dog on the offshore stuff. It\u2019s really the other guys, and that\u2019s really where the pricing leverage has been directed initially.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Dan Boyd","Hi, thanks. So Dave, it sounds like you don't expect a lag between higher oil prices and activity in North America. But what's your best guess on the lag between higher oil prices and the first quarter we may see higher international activity?","Dave Lesar","Yes, that\u2019s a -- it\u2019s actually a great question, and I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but it will be a longer lag, mainly because you look inside of the two sort of I guess tranches of customers internationally. The NOCs have not pulled back as dramatically as the IOCs have, with respect to their deepwater projects. And so, the NOCs I think will -- if you think about sort of a slow wave up and down, I think that\u2019s what you are going to see, but I think that if you look at the economics of deepwater development, I believe the IOCs are going to have to be convinced that not only are the prices at a point where these things can at least cash flow in the long run that they see an upward trajectory in oil prices that they can make a return on these deepwater projects over a period a year. So, it's certainly not going to be the first quarter or two of high oil prices before you see a bounce back in the actual contracting for revenue and the offshore.","You might see some feeds startup. You might see some pre-engineering startup. You might see project planning starting up. And all of that would be good, because it\u2019s a sign that they are thinking about going more and quickly into the deeper water, but it's going to be several quarters and it really is going to be building confidence back up in the IOCs that the market is there for the long run.","Dan Boyd","Thanks. Then just the follow-up would be of the three international regions is there one you would expect to respond more quickly?","Jeff Miller","Probably, I could see response in West Africa pretty quickly, the infrastructure is in place. It\u2019s not as hard to startup there as it would be maybe in some other markets, but again the -- there certainly would be the lag that Dave is describing.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","James Wicklund","Good morning, guys. The Middle East has been one of the better markets for everybody for a while and Saudi always gets mentioned. You guys have a lot of exposure there. There were reports out yesterday, this morning that Saudi like every other oil company I guess out there is being slow to pay its bills. But when we hear that from Saudi we get a little bit more concerned than your credit checks on E&P companies. Can you tell us if you're being impacted by that in Saudi or anyplace else in the world and the implications for that?","Christian Garcia","Jim, as a just general statement, that we are seeing lengthening of payment patterns from our customers, whether it\u2019s in the Middle East or everywhere else, but I am just happy to say that when you look at us versus our peers, our day sales outstanding continues to lead the pack.","James Wicklund","Okay, but you don't have any particular issues in Saudi?","Christian Garcia","No. No, we don\u2019t have \u2026","Jeff Miller","No, I mean I wouldn\u2019t point to anything there.","James Wicklund","Okay. My follow-up, Jeff, getting to double-digit margins by late next year gives me some idea of this, but you make some pretty good points about changes in prices in cost and structural. How much do you think -- and if we assume 30% just as a rounding point, there's been 30% cost deflation to an E&P Company, how much of that 30% do you think will end up being structural several years from now and how much of that will end up being cyclical?","Jeff Miller","Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Jim. I think if the margins are at the tail, the beginning and ending tail, you see sort of dramatic behavior. So I think that, you know, that has not been given away. I think that the path sort of more in the middle will be retained when we get back in balance here with the service companies.","So the short answer is I think we keep most of that. We do get most of that back under the right conditions, but the very right hand side of the upper limits that we saw even going back to 2012, and 2009, '10, '11, those sort of numbers -- we stay more sustainable higher margins based on how we execute, how we take off that out of the system, and that maybe preferentially better performance by Halliburton around those things.","Dave Lesar","So, I guess the only thing I would add, Jim, is to the extent we have seen any structural change that we have given up to our customer, we will take the same structural change out of our supply chain. And so, hopefully would end up basically net even.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to now turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Yes, thank you, Danielle. So I'd like to wrap up this call with just a few key takeaways. First, the pumping business in North America is clearly the most stressed segment of the market today, but it\u2019s also the market that we know the best. We know our approach works when the market turns, and it will. This is the segment that we expect to rebound the most sharply.","Second, we are maintaining our North American infrastructure required to accelerate delivery of the Baker Hughes acquisition synergies at a cost of about 400 basis points. And then finally, our international franchise continues to deliver market-leading performance on relative basis both year-over-year, and sequentially in a tough, tough market.","So I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Danielle, you can close out the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the second quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development.","I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risk are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, and recent current reports on Form 8-K.","Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing the second quarter results which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website.","Please note that our sequential comparisons today will exclude the $300 million charge reported in the first quarter of 2012 for estimated loss contingencies related to the Macondo well incident. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Dave?","David J. Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. We certainly had a lot of moving parts in the second quarter, but I was pleased with the overall final outcome. Total revenues of $7.2 billion were a new company record for us. This represented a 5% growth sequentially and was the direct result of all 3 of our international regions achieving record revenues as well as us being able to leverage our #1 market position in North America to outperform the competition once again in terms of total revenue growth.","Before we go into the details of the quarter, I would like to remind everyone of our ongoing global strategy: to maintain our market-leading position in the U.S.; gain market share in the international markets; and deliver industry-leading revenue growth and returns. By any measure, whether sequentially, year-to-date or year-on-year, we are successfully executing on this strategy.","Now let's look at our performance. From a global product line perspective, we achieved record revenues during the quarter in 8 of our 12 product lines, and in Cementing, Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Testing and Subsea, we achieved new records in both revenue and operating income.","Operating income of $1.2 billion declined 9% sequentially, primarily due to cost issues in our North American production-enhancement business, which we expect to work through by the end of the year as I will discuss shortly. International operating income was up 31% sequentially from activity and pricing improvements in all regions.","Let's look first at our North American results for the quarter. Compared to a rig count decline of 17%, our sequential revenues were essentially flat. The Canadian rig count dropped 70% sequentially due to the seasonal spring breakup. The U.S. rig count declined 1%, but our U.S. revenue actually grew 3% sequentially.","As you know, we saw a continued shift from natural gas to oil-directed activity during the quarter. The U.S. natural gas rig count declined 18% from the first quarter and is currently down 42% from its high in October of 2011. This represents a low point in the natural gas rig count over the last decade. However, the majority of the drop in gas rigs to date has been offset by an increase in oil and liquids-driven activity as our customers had shifted their budgets toward basins with better economics.","Our North American operating income was down 19% sequentially, driven by 4 factors. In descending order of impact, these factors were guar cost inflation, which I'll talk about a few minutes; the Canadian spring breakup; pricing pressures that are isolated to our production-enhancement product line; and efficiency disruptions associated with ongoing equipment locations. The impact of guar cost inflation was dramatic this quarter and we expect it to continue to impact our production-enhancement results throughout the rest of this year.","Our U.S. business is a well-functioning machine and we did not want that machine to miss a beat. We are recognized as having a reputation for the best execution reliability in the industry and are the largest 24-hour operation of any supplier in the industry. Since we were unwilling to compromise this reputation, we made a strategic decision that on top of our normal guar purchases, that we would procure a large reserve of guar based on the demand we saw in the market coming out of the first quarter. At that time, rising customer requirements in the oil and gas basins was driving up demand for gel-based systems and the elevated commodity prices at that time supported our ability to push price increases to our customers in order to counter the incremental higher input costs of our guar. For us, the equation was a simple one. Having the frac spread that made a  20% margin using higher-priced guar was better than the one that made no margin because we had no guar to pump. So during the quarter, we were able to meet all of our customer needs and in a number of cases, we were able to catch jobs our competitors could not get to because they lacked the supply of guar. This enabled us to take market share while demonstrating to these customers why they can rely on Halliburton when supply chains get stretched.","Today, supply concerns around guar have eased and spot prices have declined, but costs remain high relative to historical levels. Furthermore, the decline in oil and gas prices in the second quarter have made our customers more reluctant to accept price increases to cover our incremental guar costs. Because of the large reserve of extra guar inventory we have on hand, our results will reflect an even higher average cost of sales impact over the remainder of this year as we work through our supply of this higher-than-average cost guar. At this point, there is no shortage of guar, but most of the industry will have to work down their inventories of their higher-priced product.","So with 20-20 hindsight, simply put, we made the wrong decision. The result is we bought too much guar too early and paid too much for it. We should not have purchased the extra inventory. The impact was dramatic in the second quarter as we absorbed these higher prices and even more so in the third and fourth quarter as we work off the inventory. I want to be clear with you, I supported and agreed with the decision to secure the strategic guar reserve and I will take the heat for it.","Now let me give you some additional data on the impact guar will have in 2012. In the second quarter, about 2\/3 of our North America margin compression was due to the impact of escalating guar costs, which rose approximately 75% from the first quarter. As we go into the third quarter, traditionally our busiest quarter in North America, we expect our total guar costs will rise an additional 25% over the second quarter as we work off our high-cost reserve and then costs should reduce as we close the year. Keep in mind that while the market price for guar has dropped and supply is readily available, spot purchases made today could not be delivered to the industry for nearly 2.5 months due to grinding and shipping times.","We currently anticipate future guar pricing will decline, but the situation is still volatile. Spot prices for unprocessed guar splits fluctuated more than 30% just last week alone as the market reacted to the monsoon weather outlook. And depending on how the monsoon season plays out, our current excess guar supply may, in fact, become a strategic asset for us in North America if this year's crop falls short. But to help protect us against these issues in the future, we are actively developing alternatives to guar, which Tim will talk about later.","Moving on to pricing pressures. We saw some impact to frac pricing in the quarter. While spot frac pricing in the dry natural gas basins was under siege in the second quarter, it now appears to be leveling off, in many cases, because there are so few competitors left in these basins today. We are also seeing increasing pressure in the oil and liquids markets as we negotiate the renewals of existing stimulation contracts and win new market share. In contrast, the majority of our other product lines continue to maintain relatively stable pricing.","Now we continue to add new equipment in North America to support our Frac of the Future initiative. This quarter marked the first of our new Q10 fleets being deployed and they are already surpassing expectations in terms of well site performance, efficiency and maintenance. In the event that the market does deteriorate to where we are not earning our cost of capital, we would likely idle or retire older fleets and continue to bring new fleets out and build up our Q10 operations.","Most importantly, I believe, for you to note, is that today, our total frac fleet remains fully utilized. Every truck we build is committed to a customer before it comes off the line. And where an existing customer has reduced demand for our services in a particular basin, we have been successful at displacing the competitor on other work for either that same customer or for a new customer we could not get to in the past.","Our strategy in this environment has been and will continue to be to take advantage of our market position, differentiated technology, a more complete set of product offerings and the general flight to quality, which appears to be underway. Historically, this has resulted in market share gains during the downturn, which we have positively then leveraged during the ensuing up cycle. We see no reason for it to be different this time, and our second quarter versus our competitors certainly bears that out.","The continued migration of equipment from the gas to oil basins also means we continue to incur some lost revenue opportunities and mobilization costs with these moves.","Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we still expect to see a modest reduction in the gas rig count as operators focus on basins with better economics. We believe that despite recent improvements in natural gas spot prices, downward pressure will continue throughout the injection season. Oil and liquids-rich drilling has mostly offset recent reductions in gas rigs, and the majority of our customer base remains committed to previously stated activity levels. However, we believe that recent volatility in oil and softness in natural gas liquids may prompt certain customers to adopt a more cautious tone toward the timing of their drilling and completion activities.","As we look to 2013 for U.S. land, we are optimistic that land activity will continue to strengthen, led by a growth in unconventional developments in oil basins such as the Eagle Ford and the Bakken where we are very well aligned with the long-term asset owners. In addition, we will have worked the higher-priced guar out of our inventory and expect to be replacing it with more normally priced inventories. In this environment, our North American margins can return to their normalized levels.","Turning now to the Gulf of Mexico. We continue to see activity recover and our 2Q margins are now at pre-moratorium levels. We are optimistic about the work that we have won in directional drilling, fluids, wireline, completions and other product service lines for the new deepwater rigs arriving in the Gulf over the next few quarters. We expect that this will translate into a higher market share relative to our historical level and also believe that margins will continue to strengthen as our customers adapt to new regulations and industry efficiency improves.","Moving on to our international results. We are very pleased with the market share gains that we have made. We continue to outperform our competition in terms of revenue growth and we are now seeing margins begin to climb as we execute our strategy around economies of scale, new market entries and selective price increases, and of course, the introduction of new technology. I think it's important to note that while North America market share can fluctuate more rapidly, the market share that we have captured internationally is longer term in nature as it provides a strong incumbent position for many years to come. This is why we have been so focused on gaining international share.","We continue to be very optimistic about our Latin America business where we posted another solid quarter. Revenue was up 13% sequentially compared to a 1% gain in the rig count.","In Brazil and, therefore, for Latin America, our margins were impacted as we incurred cost to mobilize for our recent award of the wireline package. We also believe we are well-positioned to win significant incremental work on the recent bids for both directional drilling and testing in Brazil, which should position us well in the future.","Additionally, we expect our margins for consulting and software services in Latin America to expand in the second half of the year just as they've done in prior years.","Our consistent strategy in the Eastern Hemisphere is playing out positively as well as evidenced by the record revenues achieved this quarter and by our improving margins. Eastern Hemisphere revenue was up 15% sequentially relative to a rig count gain of 5%. If you look back a year, our revenues are up 23% from the second quarter of 2011, on only an 8% increase in rig count.","We continue to make progress in markets that had previously been negatively impacting our results and are optimistic about activity levels expanding in the second half of 2012.","Europe\/Africa\/CIS had a strong recovery from the first quarter. The Europe and Eurasia areas, as a whole, are now generating margins higher than our current Eastern Hemisphere average. Libya continues to recover while the investment and restructuring efforts made last year in other parts of Africa continue to pay off. We are particularly pleased with the rapid ramp-up of our East Africa operations where margins are also above our Eastern Hemisphere averages. Across the region, our service quality and technology are being recognized by our customers. In the U.K., our exceptional performance with Sperry geosteering has led to takeaways from a competitor. And based on relative performance against 2 of our large peers, another customer singled out Halliburton for our superior wireline technology. And in Tanzania, our formation evaluation team was recognized by a customer for their performance. And in Russia, we were awarded team of the year by another large IOC customer, recognizing our ongoing commitment to safety and service quality.","In the Middle East\/Asia, we recovered well from the seasonal weather experienced by Australia in the prior quarter, and China activity rebounded sharply from seasonably low levels in the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, operating income across the region is up 59%, highlighted by a 72% improvement in Asia Pac countries. During the quarter, we completed our second multistage frac operation onshore in Australia and are optimistic about this growing unconventional market.","Overall, our outlook for the international markets has not changed. We have always believed it would be slow and steady and now that seems to be the consensus among our peers. We believe international activity will continue to grow steadily, which is beginning to translate into longer-term pricing improvement. Near term, we expect that overall margin expansion will result from volume increases as our new projects ramp up, new technologies are introduced and as we continue to improve results in those markets where we have made strategic investments. We are increasingly confident that our 2012 Eastern Hemisphere exit margins will be in the upper teens and that we will average around 15% for the year.","We remain optimistic about the long-term global demand picture in commodity prices despite the various economic uncertainties that are weighing on the global hydrocarbon demand picture in the short run. Supply disruptions, including Iranian sanctions and lower-than-anticipated production levels in Iraq, Libya and Brazil, continue to pressure supply levels and the capacity in the global liquids market is still relatively tight. Continued demand growth in non-OECD countries, the declining production in mature fields and rising marginal cost of production all support the long-term fundamentals of our service business.","So going forward, we will continue to focus on maintaining our leadership position in North America, strengthen our international margins and growing our market share in deepwater in underserved international markets. Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capture market share in the expanding international unconventional business by leveraging our technology and expertise that we developed in North America. I believe our revenue growth on a relative basis has proved that strategy out for this quarter.","Now let me turn it over to Mark for some more color on the financial results.","Mark A. McCollum","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Our revenue in the second quarter was $7.2 billion, up 5% sequentially from the first quarter. Total operating income for the second quarter was $1.2 billion, down 9% from the previous quarter after normalizing for the first quarter Macondo-related charge. North America revenue remained flat and operating income decreased 19% compared to the previous quarter.","As Dave mentioned, guar cost inflation was the most significant driver, combined with the impact of Canadian breakup, frac pricing pressures and equipment relocation. Excluding Canada, we expect these challenges will contribute to incrementally lower margins for the remainder of the year. We believe the majority of the margin impact will result from working through our higher-cost guar inventory and additional pricing pressure for hydraulic fracturing.","Internationally, revenue and operating income increased 15% and 31%, respectively, compared to the previous quarter, driven by the seasonal recovery of our international business, market share gains, and to a lesser extent, improved pricing.","Looking at our second quarter results sequentially by division. Completion and Production revenue increased 4% while operating income fell 12%. North America cost issues drove the lower profitability, but were partially offset by stronger results in our international regions.","On a geographic basis, Completion and Production revenue in North America was flat sequentially as increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. land oil and liquids basins was offset by lower revenues in Canada due to the seasonal breakup.","Operating income declined by 21%, primarily due to the cost and pricing issues that are currently impacting our production-enhancement product line. The decline in U.S. land was partially offset by the Gulf of Mexico where operating income more than doubled from the first quarter.","In Latin America, Completion and Production posted an 11% sequential increase in revenue due to additional production-enhancement activity in Argentina and Mexico and increased cementing activity in Mexico and Venezuela. Operating income remained relatively flat, however. The increased activity was offset by higher costs for Boots & Coots in Mexico and Cementing in Argentina during the quarter.","In Europe\/Africa\/CIS, Completion and Production revenue increased 21% and operating income increased 67%, primarily related to the rebound of activity following seasonal weather issues in the first quarter. All product lines had improved revenue and the majority had decreased profitability compared to the preceding quarter. The operating income increase was led by improved Completion Tool sales across the region, increased Boots & Coots profitability in Angola and improved Eurasia production-enhancement and cementing activity.","In Middle East\/Asia, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased by 16% and 40%, respectively. Australia had increased -- increases across all product lines as activity recovered from seasonal weather issues in the first quarter, and we saw a healthy increase in activity across all product lines in Saudi Arabia. Also contributing to the sequential increase was higher Completion Tools sales in Indonesia, Brunei and the U.A.E. and increases in production-enhancement activity in Malaysia and Qatar.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased 8% and 7%, respectively, led by record revenue in our Baroid, Testing and Subsea and Wireline and Perforating product lines.","From a geographic perspective, performance was driven by increased Testing and Subsea activity and sales in Mexico and China as well as increased directional drilling activity in Venezuela.","In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue remained relatively flat while operating income decreased 13% primarily due to lower directional drilling in Wireline and Perforating services in Canada due to the seasonal breakup and the migration of drilling activity from gas to oil and liquids-rich basins in U.S. land. This decrease was partially offset by improved fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico.","Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased 14% and 25%, respectively due to higher Wireline and Perforating activity in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil; additional Testing and Subsea work in Mexico; as well as increased directional drilling activity in Venezuela and Ecuador.","In the Europe\/Africa\/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income increased 9% and 60%, respectively, due to increased directional drilling throughout most of the region, higher demand for fluids in Norway and some wireline direct sales into Poland.","Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East\/Asia revenue and operating income increased by 17% and 11%, respectively. China led the increase across multiple products -- product lines. We were also -- we also had improved performance in Australia, Brunei, India, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to our Majnoon project in Iraq.","Our Corporate and Other expense was $106 million this quarter and includes cost for our continued investment in various strategic initiatives. The expense related to these initiatives during the quarter totaled approximately $29 million. We anticipate the quarterly impact of these investments will increase slightly in the second half of the year to approximately $0.03 per share after-tax. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $105 million and $110 million per quarter for the remainder of 2012.","In response to the increased globalization of our business, one of the key strategic initiatives that we've been focused on is a realignment of our international operations to better position us for improved delivery of our products and services to our international customers, closer alignment to our international supply base, more efficient use of our technology and an overall reduction of our costs. Some of the indirect outcomes that we expect out of this transformational initiative will be an increase in our international earnings and the related reduction of our effective tax rate in future years. We expect to complete the first stage of this realignment in the second half of the year.","Our effective tax rate was 32% for the second quarter. And including the impact of this realignment initiative, we currently expect the full year 2012 effective tax rate will be approximately 32% to 33%.","During the quarter, our cash balance was reduced by approximately $500 million, driven in part by the increase in cost and volume of our guar inventory. Our higher level of revenues also contributed to increased receivables. We currently expect this working capital increase to turn during the back half of the year, and maintaining our cash flow discipline continues to be an important part of our strategy.","We anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year will now be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We're directing more of our CapEx spend toward international projects due to recent and expected contract wins. Based on the strength of the long-term fundamentals of our business, we feel very comfortable maintaining investments at this level. Tim?","Timothy J. Probert","Well, thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. To begin with, I want to follow up on the guar alternative Dave mentioned earlier. We successfully introduced a new product during the quarter in response to the escalating costs and the uncertainty of supply associated with guar. Our newly introduced PermStim fluid system follows in the footsteps of CleanStim, our frac fluid sourced entirely from the food industry.","PermStim delivers the proppant carrying capacity of a guar-based gel but with the advantage that it's engineered to provide a residue-free channel when the gel's broken, enhancing the hydrocarbon flow. We pumped well over 500 stages in the Rockies, Mid-Con and South Texas during the quarter and believe we've confirmed its premium performance characteristics relative to native guar-based gels. We are working to ramp up production to establish it as a permanent part of our product lineup, increasing the performance and the reliability of our delivery platform.","We're pleased with the execution of our international strategy and the record revenues seen in all 3 international regions this quarter.","In Middle East\/Asia, we've significantly expanded our offshore and deepwater position with a series of major Pan-Malaysian contract awards and extensions. These contracts are valued at more than $700 million with services across our portfolio, including drilling, wireline, perforating, testing and completions. In Australia, as the unconventional market unfolds there, operators are looking for empirical knowledge and a proven track record to help them develop their assets. Our Pinnacle microseismic and tiltmeter technologies were successfully utilized to characterized unconventional assets for our customers in Queensland and South Australia in the quarter.","In Europe\/Africa, our deepwater activity in East Africa continues to grow and we're currently providing services on all deepwater rigs there with a leading position in fluid services, cementing, completions and drilling. I should add that our entry into East Africa wireline markets has been successful, too. The position we've established in East Africa deepwater has provided us a platform for recent contract awards for onshore exploration areas in Ethiopia and Uganda.","In the Latin America region, we reported last quarter on the delivery of the record-setting PA-1565 well in Mexico's Chicontepec basin, the Remolino lab, which had outstanding performance. We followed this success, completing 6 additional wells all exceeding initial production estimates as well. During the quarter, a zipper frac, a stimulation of 2 separate and parallel unconventional wells was performed with Halliburton's RapidFrac sleeve technology, a first in Latin America and with excellent production results.","Now as you know, we are committed to growing our share internationally without sacrificing long-term margins and returns. The latest market report from Spears and Associates indicates our share position grew last year in all major product lines except for pressure pumping.","Our Completion Tools product line is a notable success and has just taken the #1 global market share position. This is a culmination of a multiyear effort focused on new technology development and cost and efficiency gains through an aggressive supply chain strategy. This incorporates new roofline in Singapore and Malaysia to serve the needs of our international customers.","One highlight of the completion's growth story is our expandable liner hanger system, VersaFlex, which has shown 40%-plus annual growth rates over the last 3 years as it displaces standard systems and becomes our customers' preferred method of delivering liner top pressure integrity.","New completions technology is playing a part, too. We've also just deployed our new enhanced single-trip multistage completion system in the Gulf of Mexico. Designed for use in deep and ultra deepwater, the system enables several intervals within a well to be isolated and treated with a high-rate frac pack during a single trip of the workstring. This unique technology saved this deepwater operator 18 days of rig time. Dave?","David J. Lesar","Thanks, Tim. Let me just summarize. I know there -- a lot of people got on the call late today. We're very proud of our second quarter results. We've set new record -- revenue record totals for the company, and in all 3 of our international regions and for 8 of our product lines.","North America. We expect our frac margins will be compressed by higher-cost guar and additional pricing pressures. But our other product lines, however, remain stable. Internationally, the story is playing out as expected. We continue to gain share and fully expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to be in the upper teens in the second half of the year with a full year average in the mid-teens. And finally, we intend to deliver industry-leading revenue growth and returns.","So let's open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is there a way to quantify some of the margin impact in North America for pressure pumping and how we could be in, maybe by the end of the year, where could margins be? Do you see fourth quarter, could the benefit from guar price declines maybe start to offset some of the seasonal declines and pricing pressures?","Mark A. McCollum","Waqar, this is Mark. In the comments, we tried to give you a little bit of color. There's going to be a fairly significant impact for guar inventory costs as we move through the year. As Dave said, about 2\/3 of our margin delta in the second quarter is related to guar costs as we look and that inflated about 75% over first quarter levels. We expect guar to inflate another 25% in the third quarter. And so in probably sort of relative terms, that's going to end up being about 2\/3 of the impact as we look forward. That should abate as we go into Q4. There will be some pricing impact. We are expecting, as long as there's risk to the gas rig count which we expect will continue to be pressured through the end of the injection season, there will be pressure on hydraulic fracturing margins. But there will be some benefit for Canada getting back to work as well to offset that. So it's difficult to say exactly where that will be. We're not going to give specific margin guidance sort of beyond that, but I think that, that ought to be sufficient to kind of help you find where we are. But all of those things should be relatively transitory. As we go into 2013, we're expecting the rig count to begin to grow again, the guar cost issues to be behind us and normalized based on sort of what ought to be market industry averages. And from there, then we also should start seeing the benefits of our Frac of the Future initiative, all of the things that we've been doing to try to transform the business to reduce our costs, will to continue to provide some uplift to our margins as we go into 2013.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the past, you've said that you normalized margins around 25%, 26% for North America. Has anything changed in your view that at some point in 2013, you could not get back to that kind of level?","Mark A. McCollum","No, nothing's changed from that front. We still believe that, sort of that mid-20s range is our normalized area of margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from James West of Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to follow up little bit on the North America simulation topic, curious as to when you roll over contracts now, are you still able to achieve pretty significant pricing, I guess, premiums versus your competitors? So if the market's down 20, you're only down, call it 10, just to throw a number out there? And then second, are your customers still asking for the same level of term contracts as they were, say, 3 or 6 months ago?","Timothy J. Probert","So 2 parts to that question, James. I think first of all, obviously, contracts are renewing throughout the year. That's a bit in contrast to the way it was 3 or 4 years ago when we kind of had the big renegotiations at the end of the year. And the answer is, yes, we believe that we're continuing to get a premium as we renew those contracts. That's quite clear. And secondly, in terms of the term, I would say they're getting shorter. Obviously, you're in an environment when there is more uncertainty than it was when the original contracts were undertaken, so it's reasonable to assume that those terms will be shorter than they were previously.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Mark, maybe...","Timothy J. Probert","That's not necessarily a bad thing either because if we see some recovery, we have an opportunity to move things.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure, absolutely. That makes sense. And then Mark, I'm going to come ask a question on North American margins. Again, the gap down we saw from 1Q to 2Q was pretty significant. There are a lot of moving parts in there, but is it safe to say as we think about the rest of this year that, that we've already seen kind of the biggest gap down. Margins, of course, will go down as you've said, but have we seen the biggest kind of at least sequential drop?","Mark A. McCollum","Yes, definitely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you, Tim, talk a little about what you're seeing in frac pricing today? Are you seeing some areas that have starting to stabilizing -- starting to stabilize or they're still declining? And then, of your term contracts on percentage terms, can you say generally how much has actually rolled over at least to today's spot market prices versus still has yet to roll over? And then as you roll over your contracts, has any of the terms changed besides pricing?","Timothy J. Probert","Okay, just a couple of comments on the sort of sequencing of pricing, I guess. As Dave mentioned, the dry basins have been the most challenging to this point, but they appear to be stabilizing. And secondly, the next in the sequence was the more accessible oily basins, which received the greatest pressure like the Eagle Ford, for example. But I think that, really, the changing terms that we see, I think, are solely restricted at this point to pricing and term as we just referenced on the question with James. And I do want to sort of reinforce the fact here that we tend to not talk about this too much. But outside pressure pumping, really, all -- pretty much all other product lines are very stable in their pricing outlook, so we're dealing with a single product line here. Did I miss anything from your question?","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, and then one more. You did a great job. But one more is that on your term contracts, how many of the contracts, as a percentage terms, have rolled over to today's spot rates or have yet to roll over?","Timothy J. Probert","We're still on a sort of 80% to 85% contract basis. And as I mentioned before that we're much more evenly oriented through the year in terms of our renewals these days than we were several years ago. So it's hard for me to give you an exact percentage, but clearly we're a ways through the conversion process.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. And then as a follow-up or unrelated follow-up. On the international markets, obviously congratulations on the record results there on the revenue side. You've had very impressive market share gains. Are you going to start -- from here going forward, will you start to put international margins as a priority over additional market share gains, or is market share gains still your #1 priority?","Timothy J. Probert","No, we think we can do both. And the reason we say that is, as Dave referred to, we're focused on a couple of things. We're focused on the economies of scale and that is being large enough in a given market to be able to be as efficient as we can be, which we can't say in all markets has been the case historically; and secondly, the issue around underserved markets, markets which we have had a very, very limited presence in; and thirdly, the repair of certain markets, which have been damaged through time. So are we going to focus on margins, are we focusing on margins? Absolutely, but this is not a binary equation. We're going to do both.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just stick on the international side. Question on the margin expansion you had talked about in Eastern Hemisphere in second half of the year. Is this all going to be volume-driven on basically this cost absorption at this point? And how soon can we start thinking about the impact of pricing and technology upside? Are we like a couple of quarters away, I guess I'm just trying to hone in, a little bit more specific on that question.","Timothy J. Probert","So I think that clearly, there is a volume effect. We're starting to see -- finally see the rig count activity move, which is encouraging. It's been really, it's been slow-growing to this point in terms of the move of rig count. So volume is an element. We're clearly seeing sort of a bifurcation in terms of contract structure; the very, very large contracts are still quite challenging from a pricing standpoint. But we're pushing pricing where we can on smaller contracts and I think we have some good examples from each of our operating regions where pricing has actually moved. So it's going to be a combination of both those elements.","Mark A. McCollum","Part of the situation, David, is we'll still have some mobilization cost during the, really the next 2 quarters as we mobilize on some of the new contract wins that we've had. But that's -- we still think our overall forecast at the margin targets that we set are very, very achievable. And it's based on a lot of deepwater activity we're seeing coming into the market, as well as the repair of these markets that we've been working on quite a bit that's sort of within our control to manage the cost side.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just switching over or switching back to North America. Dave, you had mentioned getting back to normalized margins levels in North America. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a peek into your playbook there. I mean, how does that play out under your base case scenario? I don't know if you're assuming oil prices hold here? You had talked about rig count kind of modestly declining the rest of the year. How does this all kind of play out in terms of the way you're looking at this? And particularly in light of limited capacity additions, kind of trying to figure out kind of as this market tightens, I mean how are you guys thinking about the different mechanisms that have to happen here to get back to normalized margins?","David J. Lesar","I think, obviously, Dave, the big one is to get the sort of guar pig through the python, as we call it, sort of here internally. That's actually will have the most impact on moving margins back up. Second is the playbook says that as the gas rig count comes down, oil continues to go up. You have the issue around the liquids plays today. But for us, it's a pretty simple strategy: use our economies of scale, number one; pull through additional product lines with the products we have and even in a looser market from a frac equipment standpoint, the execution reliability and the ability to demonstrate that we have a better response in terms of production to our PE activities does allow us to pull through other product lines; and then I think is letting the dust settle around a lot of these equipment moves that we've had to make, as we've moved not only frac equipment now but also other product line equipment out of the gas plays into the liquids and oil plays. So we have a lot of equipment on the move right now. We've got a lot of people on the move, but I think those would be the elements that, as the dust settles on them, should allow our margins to basically get back to where they would be considered normal, actually without a tremendous amount, if any, ability to increase prices.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Mark and Dave, you provided us with a margin target for Eastern Hemisphere and looks like you're well on your way to doing that, upper teens by year-end and mid-teens for the year. Any thoughts with regard to how Latin America margins progress from this point forward with the thought in mind that it sounds like you guys have won this big tender in Brazil on the MWD or LWD front or are well positioned to do so? Mark, you've talked about increased mob costs the next couple of quarters, I assume that relates in part to that. How do Latin America margins unfold from this point?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, one of the larger drivers of margins for the back half of the year will not only be the playing out of that mob cost, which a big chunk of that will be finished toward the end of the third quarter but also, as Dave mentioned, we've got some other work that we know is coming on the Landmark, the software sales and service consulting work that typically shows itself across-the-board in Latin America, particularly in Mexico. That is just now getting underway. It's very high-margin business and if you look at over the last couple of years, our Latin America margins were relatively benign coming out of the first quarter recovery sort of activity levels and then jumped significantly in the back part of the year. And so as we look at the volume of activity that we're doing, particularly across not only Brazil but Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador and then Mexico, this pickup of activity in Mexico around the Remolino lab, the -- our southern alliance project and then this Landmark pop that we get at the end of the year, we feel pretty good about where that will move and it should meet or exceed our levels that we had achieved last year, which were, at that point in time, sort of back to sort of normalized record levels of Latin America margins.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, Dave, you talked about sort of a recipe, if you will, for North American margin recovery. Oil rig count moving higher was one of your stipulations. Assuming that basically WTI doesn't have significant uplift from here, the E&P industry continues to be somewhat cash flow-constrained and the oil rig count is basically flattish from this point forward, can margins get back to target levels in a relatively flattish environment?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, I -- this is Mark. I think that the ultimate issue is that probably in a relatively flattish market, the answer would be no other than the recovery of the loss that we've had around the guar inventory. Once that flushes through, we've given you a roadmap as to what that should add back. But I think as we look ahead, it's difficult to see a relatively flat rig count environment if commodity prices hold at this level for a significant period of time. I mean, we think at some point here in the next quarter or 2, the gas rig count is going to basically bottom out. And once that does, the oil rig count should be able to grow unfettered, which should provide some upside to it. The other side of it that we see also is the Gulf of Mexico recovery, which, again, is counting, as we look at the end of the year, should be approaching 40 deepwater rigs. We think our share is higher in this type of market than it was in the previous upturn and that provides some fairly significant margin uplift as well to the numbers that should help.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Back to North American pressure pumping, my question is not on new contracts but on existing term contracts that you have. Are you, in any cases, willing to renegotiate an existing contract down to keep, let's say, all the associated work that you have with it? The fluids, the bits, the wireline completions, et cetera?","Timothy J. Probert","The one thing I think we can say is that the contract -- the sanctity, if you like, of the contract structure has been very, very good. And Jim, in life everything is negotiable. I mean, if there is a quid pro quo which makes sense for us, then a renegotiation may well take place. So I think suffice to say that we -- as Dave had said, we're very focused on maximizing the pull-through for our operations from our hydraulic fracturing footprint. And if that were, for example, to be an opportunity for us to negotiate, then that would be a good example of something we'd probably go for.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So you're -- so if we're looking at sort of the percentage of fleet -- frac fleets that you have under, let's just say, old pricing, it seems that at least it's a possibility that the prices could come down a bit just for the frac piece of it earlier than, I guess, than what the original contracts would suggest?","David J. Lesar","Yes, I guess, Jim, this is Dave, it's possible but as Tim said, there's a quid pro quo with everything. And so we're -- if we trade off some frac pricing early before the contract, we're going to insist on additional market share with that customer or we're going to insist on pull-through of other services. From a customer's perspective, they're going to spend it with us or spend it with somebody else, so that's actually a pretty good conversation to be in with a customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering & Company.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","In North America, we spent a lot of time talking about margins, but revenue was quite good this quarter. And what you see from an activity standpoint plus Canadian, albeit kind of weaker seasonal recovery than normal, is revenue able to grow in the third quarter, you think?","Mark A. McCollum","The answer is yes. I mean typically Q3 is our strongest quarter of the year, our highest activity levels across-the-board. Yes, Canada is getting a little bit of a slow start this quarter. Don't know whether that will persist or not. But as Dave mentioned, we're continuing to add equipment. It's going to work. We know it's going to go to work and that's part of what's creating the uplift on our revenue side as well. We also believe that Gulf of Mexico will continue to improve during the third quarter as well. So all in all, revenue is expected to be up.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And the follow-up question, just on the domestic D&E segment. Given that Gulf of Mexico op income doubled for the company sequentially, I'm surprised that the margins eroded as much as they did. Was that just a really harsh Canada or can you give us some color on what happened?","Timothy J. Probert","Yes, we have particularly high exposure for D&E in Canada and that hit us quite hard during the quarter. Secondly, we also had some sort of end effects associated with some relocations from gas basins into oily plays, which impacted us quite a bit as well. But our expectation for D&E as we move into Q3 is that we will recover and we'll be at or modestly above the Q1 D&E numbers for Q3.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Urban of Deutsche Bank.","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to talk about Iraq a little bit. Sounds like activity continuing to ramp up there. You did reference some costs in the quarter. Was that above and beyond what you had expected or just a function of the higher activity in some of the bids that we've seen in that market?","Mark A. McCollum","I think the honest answer is yes. It was a little bit above what we have expected that it would be. Across Iraq, we've had some good activity. Our business across almost every single one of our projects has done very, very well. We also have had some issues around getting diesel and things out to some of our sites. The issues, as I referenced, really are isolated to the Majnoon contract and that's been probably -- that's the one field which is sort of the, from a logistic standpoint, is a furthest field that we deal with. And that's where diesel's been an issue. Some of the rigs sort of staying engaged have been an issue. And so we took some additional cost on Majnoon in the quarter that we were not expecting. We're continuing to try to work on that. I think that we feel positive about what else is happening there and we feel positive about Iraq in the long term. This one particular project has been a little bit of an issue and we're trying to get that righted so that overall results -- I mean that sort of what's standing between us and profitability is this particular project, and we're almost there.","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And could you expand a little bit on the outlook there in terms of where you're going? Again, I think there were some additional work being bid, additional projects, maybe Kurdistan a little bit, and just kind of your path there going forward in terms of potential additional ramp-up versus volume and contracts and the path to profitability there?","Mark A. McCollum","We won a project with Gazprom during the quarter, I think that was publicly announced and so feel good about that. We are doing a little bit of work in Kurdistan and are looking for opportunities to expand our operations to the North as well. So we're continuing to feel pretty good about what's happening there and looking at other various opportunities. It's going to be a slow and measured pace just like the rest of Eastern Hemisphere. But from a long-term perspective, we feel great about that market.","Kelly Youngblood","Operator, you can now close the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Thanks, Sam. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton's third quarter 2013 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the third quarter results is also available on the Halliburton website.","Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO, Jeff Miller, COO, and Mark McCollum, CFO. Tim Probert, President of Strategy and Corporate Development will also be available today for follow-up calls.","I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended June 31, 2013, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission laws.","Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the financial impact of the third quarter charges related to employee severance and asset write-offs, $38 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share unless otherwise noted.","We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Before I talk about another strong quarterly performance I would like to review the actions we have taken this year around our commitment to delivering shareholder returns to you. This year, we have repurchased approximately 4.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares. Earlier this year, we announced a 39% increase in our dividend. These actions reflect our continued confidence and the strength of our business outlook.","Going forward, we remain fully committed to increased shareholder returns. We are targeting a dividend payout of at least 15% to 20% of net income, supplemented by additional systematic share buybacks while leaving room for any capital spending or acquisitions we may want to do. We have been and will continue to be relentlessly focused on delivering best-in-class returns.","Now, moving to the third quarter. Overall, I am pleased with our operational results. Total company revenue of $7.5 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton, while operating income was over $1.1 billion. We achieved record revenues this quarter in our Boots & Coots, Cementing, Completion Tools, Drill Bits, Multi-Chem and Testing Product lines. From an operating income perspective, our Baroid, Completion Tools, Drill Bits and Testing Product lines also set new records.","Turning to the geographies. On a year-to-date basis, our Eastern Hemisphere growth continues to lead our peer group. Compared to last year, third quarter year-over-year revenue and operating income grew 17% and 30%, respectively. Sequentially, the revenue improvement, a 9% growth in operating income was driven by our Europe\/Africa\/CIS region.","In addition to record revenue in that region, we saw a strong sequential improvement in margins of 300 basis points, due to improved performance in our Russia, North Sea and Angola operations. Consistent with previous years, we expect the fourth quarter in the Eastern Hemisphere to be our strongest quarter of the year, due to seasonal year end software and equipment sales.","Moving to Latin America. This has been a tough year as customer activity did not meet our expectations and Jeff will talk more about our fourth quarter outlook, but as we look ahead to Latin America over the next few years, there are several positive factors coming into play.","First, Mexico activities are expected to pick up significantly as the mega tender projects ramp up in the first part of 2014. Although we do not expect a material impact next year, the recent reform discussions signal a strong opportunity in Mexico shale and deepwater markets.","In Brazil, we have a leading market share today in a number of long-term deepwater contracts, including some that could extend past 2020. Although activity levels are just treading water today, as deepwater activity level accelerates, we see significant upside in Brazil. However there could be some short-term bumps in the road, but in the long-term Latin America is expected to be an outstanding growth market for Halliburton.","In North America, we are expecting the typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter that we have experienced in previous years. However there are some additional transitory issues we are currently facing. Due to the recent floods in Colorado, logistical disruptions in the Niobrara, where we have a very high market share are lingering into the fourth quarter which is continuing to impact our efficiency in cost structure in that basin. These cost inefficiencies should be fixed by the end of the year.","And pricing, the North America market continues to have excess supply of pressure pumping equipment, and although this is improving, we anticipate pricing pressure will continue as contracts review during the next quarter or so. Accordingly, we are already working on adjusting our cost structure. Despite these transitory issues, we believe that we will see margin improvement as we go through 2014 for a number of reasons.","First, the efficiency trend on land plays write to our strengths. We are not only leading the industry and execution and surface efficiency, but we are now introducing new technologies, which are changing the ways that customers approach their subsurface. You will hear more about these at our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. The Gulf of Mexico activity levels are improving. Currently they are shifting from drilling to completions where we have a leading market position. There are dozen or so deepwater rigs scheduled on the calendar to arise on the Gulf next year and on those we have secured a strong drilling and evaluation position.","Thirdly, our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives are being rolled out now. I have seen them start to operate in the field. The benefits are real and we expect that they will be substantial. We have invested a significant amount of money in our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives. As we told you on our last call, when we roll out these two broad corporate initiatives, we are continuously looking for ways to use them to better manage our cost structure in the organization. During the third quarter, based on the progress of these initiatives, we have made adjustments to headcount and assets that resulted in a charge. As we continue with the deployment of our Battle Red initiative over the next few quarters, we expect for there to be additional headcount reductions and related severance charges. However, again, as you will see at our upcoming Analyst Day we are expecting a large future payoff for these initiatives.","So overall, I am very optimistic about Halliburton's relative performance as we move into 2014 and based on early conversations with our customers, we are anticipating overall spend levels to increase. Our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. At our analyst day we intend to provide you more detail about our outlook for the coming years, our ability to outperform our peer group, how we will continue to balance our geographical portfolio and describe our path toward normalized margins for both the Eastern and Western hemisphere operations. We will continue to drive toward expanding our global portfolio in the deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff for some operational details.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Met me begin with an overview of our third quarter results. The Eastern hemisphere had record revenue in the third quarter with sequential operating income growth of 9% driven by record quarterly revenue and improved profitability in the Europe, Africa and CIS region. Relative to the second quarter, Europe\/Africa\/CIS were both revenue and operating income by 3% and 29% respectively.","The sequential improvement was led by improved cementing, Boots & Coots activity in Russia, increased drilling and cementing activity in the North Sea and higher drilling and completion tool sales in Angola. In Norway, Statoil has awarded contracts to Halliburton that provide us with a leading market share in multiple services including drilling and completion fluids, cementing, stimulation, special tools and waste management for both onshore and offshore. The initial scope of this contract is for three years with up to six years in extensions. This award represents a significant statement of confidence from our customers for the value-added technologies that we are bringing to the Norwegian market.","In addition we are expanding our testing portfolio in the pre-salt deepwater market in Angola. In addition to discrete testing awards for drill stem testing and our DynaLink service, Halliburton has recently been awarded contracts by multiple customers to provide a full suite of testing in subsea services in their pre-salt operations. Activity on these wins is expect to start throughout 2014 and will give Halliburton a significant position for testing in subsea services in the Angola pre-salt market. In conjunction with our successes in testing offshore discovery wells elsewhere in Africa and in Brazil, these one demonstrate the strength of our deepwater testing and subsea business.","In the Middle East\/Asia region, compared to the prior quarter, revenue and operating income were lower by 2% and 5% respectively. Higher activity in Saudi Arabia was partially offset by activity delays for stimulation activity in Australia. Also contributing to the sequential decline was the prior quarter benefit from the conclusion of the Majnoon project in Iraq and increased completions activity in Malaysia that did not repeat.","Let me speak specifically to the Kurdistan market for a moment. This is an area that until now has been primarily focused on exploration, but we are expecting development work will ramp up over the next few years following a series of successful appraisal programs. However, it is completed construction of large multiproduct line facility in Kurdistan and we are mobilizing for recent awards in cementing, Sperry, Baroid among other product lines.","We are still in the early days, but we expect this to be a growth market for Halliburton. In Saudi Arabia, Halliburton was awarded an important three-year contract to drill and complete new wells on an existing field. Saudi Arabia is a core market for Halliburton, and we believe this one demonstrates our customers' confidence in Halliburton's ability to help, plan and mobilized to execute the significant program.","Turning to Latin America, we saw a significant improvement compared to the second quarter as revenues increased 6%, sequentially and operating income improved by 57%. Mexico was the primary driver for recent contract approvals resulted in an increase in the consulting and software revenue for the quarter.","In the offshore market, stimulation vessel utilization was improved relative to the first half of the year. Additionally, improved profitability in Wireline and cementing in Argentina, contributed to the sequential growth. The improved results in Mexico and Argentina more than offset the activity related weakness in Brazil and Venezuela.","With respect to Brazil and Mexico, we believe that the fourth quarter activity levels maybe significantly lower than originally anticipated. There are two primary reasons for this decrease. First, in Mexico, activity levels on our southern alliance the project are expected to decline meaningfully over the remaining months of the year as PEMEX ramps down the ongoing IPM work in preparation for the mega tenders.","We averaged seven rigs in the southern alliance project during the third quarter and expect to exit the year at two rigs. This lower level of activity has been expected to continue through early 2014 and company until the new mega tender projects are expected to ramp up.","Second, in Brazil, we have seen a significant reduction in drilling activity over the course of the year with a shift in focus to completions. In addition, we are currently operating under a cost structure in line with the original scope of work which has not materialized. We are working with our customer to right size our operational footprint, but we expect reduced activity levels to extend through the fourth quarter and continue into the next year.","Ultimately, this does not change our long-term positive outlook for Latin America. The transition to the mega tenders in Mexico, in conjunction with the startup of our incentivized Humapa contract and improved deepwater rig count give us confidence that the activity levels in Mexico will recover as each of these areas gets underway.","In Brazil, our recent deepwater contract have a potential term of about eight years, so although drilling activity metrics sideways for several quarters, Brazil remains the largest and most active deepwater market in the world and we believe higher drilling activity levels will resume. As a result, we expect both these countries to continue to be strong contributors to our growth and profitability over time.","Now, switching North America, despite the significant revenue and operating income disruption from the Colorado floods, we delivered sequential revenue growth and higher operating income. Activity levels improving and cost the rest of the U.S. land market with seasonal recovery in Canada and increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater market.","U.S. land rig count remained sluggish and the focus from our customers continues to be on pad operations and on drilling efficiency. As we discussed in our previous call, multi-well pads account for over half of our customers drilling activities in key North America basins, including the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara, and we see this percentage increasing, but more importantly we see increased service efficiency on horizontal drilling which is providing a mid-teens percentage reduction in drilling days on a year-over-year basis. Together, these two efficiency factors are contributing to a well count that has modestly improved even in a flat rig environment.","We are also seeing a trend towards increasing stage counts per well, and in certain basins increased volumes pumped per stage. Already, we are seeing average stage count per well increase by 15% to 20% year-over-year in the Eagle Ford and in the Marcellus. We are still in an oversupplied market today, with as much as 20% excess pressure pumping capacity. Nevertheless we believe that an increase in wells drilled per rig combined with greater service intensity driven by increased fluids and profit volumes per well will ultimately help balance the market. We believe that these trends play to Halliburton's strength as the leading service provider in North America.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw sequential improvement tampered by some activity delays and extended drydock maintenance on one of our large stimulation vessels. In the fourth quarter we expect revenue improvement in the Gulf as that vessel returns to service as well as higher completions activity and end of year sales. Looking ahead we are excited about expanding our share position in this growing market. In addition to our leading completions position, we recently deployed two new vessels focused on the shelf, an intervention vessel and a fit for purpose stimulation vessel. Additionally, we believe we are well-positioned with drilling and evaluation services on the next round of incoming deepwater rigs.","To recap North America. Activity levels continue to improve across the U.S. land market this quarter, despite the disruption from the Colorado floods. Increased rig efficiency, combined with greater service intensity, continues to benefit us even with a rig count that is flat. We are increasingly optimistic about 2014 based on early data points and will continue to be very focused on our cost structure to enable margin growth in the coming year.","Internationally, we are very pleased with our year-over-year growth. In spite of short-term activity disruptions in Latin America this year, we have led our peer group in year-to-date growth and plan to continue balancing our geographic portfolio and growing our global business going forward.","Now Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Dave discussed, we are continuously evaluating our cost structure within the organization as we deploy our corporate initiatives. The ongoing Frac of the Future build as well as the final deployment of our Battle Red program is having a significant impact on the support and operational headcount needs of North America as well as equipment and inventory requirements. During the third quarter, as we begin to roll out these initiatives, we completed an initial evaluation of these areas and took our first action, which resulted in severance and other charges during the quarter of approximately $38 million after tax. As Dave said, based on the early impact of these strategic initiatives, we believe that further rollout may result in some additional adjustments going forward.","Our corporate and other expense came in at a $102 million this quarter, slightly lower than expected due to lower cost for our strategic initiatives and some lower legal expenses. Approximately $27 million of our corporate costs were for continued investment in Battle Red and other strategic initiatives. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.03 per share after tax in the fourth quarter, as we begin the field deployment of the last phases of the North America Battle Red initiative. In total, we anticipate the corporate expenses will be between $110 million and $120 million for the fourth quarter.","Our effective tax rate this quarter came in at 29.5%, in line with our previous guidance. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that our tax rate will be approximately 29%. Our capital expenditure guidance of approximately $3 billion for the full year remains unchanged. Also during the quarter, we purchased 68 million shares of common stock at a price of $48.50 per share for an aggregate cost of $3.3 billion excluding fees and expenses related to our tender offer. These shares represented approximately 7.4% of our total number of outstanding shares.","Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 10% of our outstanding common stock. We have approximately $1.7 billion remaining in Board authorization for future share repurchases. For the fourth quarter, our average share count is expected to be approximately 855 million shares outstanding, which reflects the full benefit of our share buyback to-date. Additionally, due to our recent $3 billion debt offering, we expect interest expense to average approximately $100 million per quarter going forward.","Now moving on to our near-term outlook. For our Eastern Hemisphere business, we currently expect fourth quarter year-over-year revenue to increase by low double digits with a meaningful sequential improvement in margins into the high teens.","As mentioned earlier, Latin America's sequential growth in margins are expected to be significantly impacted by activity levels in Mexico. For the fourth quarter, we now anticipate Latin America revenue to be flat sequentially and do not expect the material change in margins relative to the third quarter.","Finally, for North America, we anticipate the typical weather and holiday-related seasonal declined in revenue and margins in the fourth quarter. With the transitory issues Dave outlined earlier weighing on the number a little more than usual. As a result, we believe North America will be down sequentially although we are not expecting as sharp of a decline as we had in 2012.","As we move into 2014, we anticipate North America margins to recover as customer activity resumes and we see the pay off of our strategic efficiency programs in recent cost optimization efforts.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments. Dave?","Dave Lesar","Thanks, Mark. Just a quick summary, Eastern Hemisphere continues to deliver top-tier growth, leading the industry year-to-date and we expect a strong fourth quarter with margins in the high teens. Latin America will be flattish, but expect strong growth in 2014. For North America, we anticipate typical seasonality in the fourth quarter with some pricing pressure and lingering effects of the Colorado floods, but margin improvement as we go into 2014. Finally, as demonstrated by our dividend increase earlier this year, and the repurchase of 10% of our shares, we are very confident in the strength of our business outlook and are focused on delivering leading shareholders returns.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now open.","James West - Barclays Capital","Congratulations on a continued strong growth this semester. Very impressive. Dave, a question for you about the outlook for 2014, specifically on the international side. Your peers seem to be coalescing around E&P spending growth somewhere in the kind of 10% range with a higher technology content which of course plays into your strength as well as theirs. Is that similar to your thinking initially?","Dave Lesar","Yes. Absolutely. I think based on discussions with customers, sort of contract flow that we have got in hand I would be surprised if it isn\u2019t around that number for next year.","James West - Barclays Capital","Okay. That's very helpful. Then perhaps a little bit of an unrelated follow-up for me. With the Colorado flooding, I know Mark you had mentioned at a presentation that you thought it was $0.02, $0.03 in the third quarter, but that was an initial assessment. Do you have an updated number or some type of sizing of that impact that we could think about?","Jeff Miller","James, this is Jeff. For competitive reasons, we are not going to give you the number other than to say that it is certainly an important part of our business and I guess I would leave you with, absent that, it would have been enough to move our completion margins up for North America.","Jeff Miller","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey of ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Jud Bailey - ISI Group","Thank you. Good morning. Question on your Latin America market. Two biggest markets Mexico and Brazil have some different issues going on. I was wondering if you could help us to think about margins beyond the fourth quarter. What has to happen in Brazil in 2014 and in Mexico, to see a nice recovery in margins? There is the simple increasing activity or there's some other things you guys can do to facilitate better margin growth for Latin America in 2014?","Jeff Miller","Hi Jud, Jeff here. I would say that Brazil it\u2019s the combination of activity increase would help as well as rightsizing our investment, which we are in the process of doing now, so there are some things that we can do and others that we need the client to do. With respect to Mexico, I think we really need to see a settling down of all the moving pieces which, right now, we have got incentivized contract to get started which certainly helps us, as well as the turnover in the contracting around these mega tenders also brings some stability. So I think those two things do as much as any to improve margins into next year.","Jud Bailey - ISI Group","And would it be fair to say that the visibility in both those markets is fairly limited near-term? And if you do get some margin improvement, is it going to more backend loaded for the year? Or is there some reason we could see better improvement earlier in the year.","Jeff Miller","Well, I would say, we typically see quite a bit of seasonality in Latin America and so all the moving parts, I don't think, help in Q1. So I would say we tend to be more backend weighted.","Mark McCollum","Our general profitability in Mexico is very strong. So when this activity does kick up and kick back in we expect a fairly good and solid snapback. As Jeff said that we are getting started in these new contracts in Brazil. We need more activity but even starting those, for there will be a period of time when the Brazil margins may be detrimental to our overall Latin America margins, but remember these are very long-term contracts, eight years and longer and there will be significant up sell opportunities as those contracts gain traction. We have ability to introduce new technologies into that marketplace.","Jud Bailey - ISI Group","Thanks, that's good color. Thank you. My second question just relates to the U.S. land market. I know your customers are still going through the budgeting process, but maybe you could share with us anything you are hearing from your customers, in terms of giving us little more color on your thoughts for 2014 in terms of activity levels and what your customers are telling you for next year?","Jeff Miller","Yes. For 2014, the outlook is fairly strong. The discussions we are having now sees confidence in the oil window and continuing to invest. So we certainly have a positive outlook for 2014.","Mark McCollum","It may not necessarily reflect itself in rig count, but certainly in the well count and efficiencies everybody is very, very focused on continuing to drive efficiencies in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thanks and good morning. Back to North America and the Q4 seasonality. Dave, I think you prophesied a typical seasonality into Q4 and yet what unfolded in the third quarter was largely atypical with regard to the flooding in Colorado. So wouldn't that mute the seasonality in the fourth quarter relative to the third?","Dave Lesar","Well I guess, if we were up and blowing and going in the Niobrara, it might. But as I said, that's sort of lingering into Q4. And I think it's fair to say the visibility on Q4, right now, is not as great as we would like it to be because based on conversations we are having with customers, the holiday work schedule is one of the big unknowns at this point in time with Christmas falling in the middle of the week, and just where various customers are in terms of spending their budgets for the year and those sorts of things. I think we are just, as we sit here today, what we see is a typical Q4 unfolding in front of us and if it changes from that, obviously we will have either a positive or a negative impact from there.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Got it. And with regards to capital allocation, I know you guys are not done with your planning process, but could you just give us some broad parameters with regard to capital spending for '14? And then moreover the mechanics of the dividend implementation, 15% to 20% of net income, when does that get announced and what is that predicated on? Is that an internal view as to what you guys will be generating in terms of net income or what?","Dave Lesar","Okay. So on the capital side, it is still early in the planning process but I think that, right now, as we look ahead while there are - we are pretty excited about the growth trajectory going into 2014 we are driving hard on efficiencies. So that will probably continue to allow us to be more disciplined around how much capital we are putting into the marketplace. So we don't sit here today expecting a significant increase in capital overall. There will be some specific projects, maybe some reorientation within the budget. We will continue to rollout our Q-10s and the Frac of the Future into the North American marketplace and question is how rapidly do we do that vis-\u00e0-vis the overall market trajectory, but right now don't see significant changes in the capital overall.","The dividend policy, the 15% to 20% of net income, it will always be sort of a moving target. The Board has the discretion to set that dividend target, they do so always in looking not just at the net income, but also our cash flow and looking at our relative investment opportunities that fall ahead of us.","I guess the answer is stay tuned and we will be talking with the Board and then making adjustments as necessary, but our cash flow continue to be very, very positive. Even with all the actions that we took this quarter, we are very pleased with the cash flow in the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. My question relates to international service pricing. What are you seeing there? Either the same trends, are you seeing some better pricing now?","Jeff Miller","This is Jeff. As we look out into the Eastern Hemisphere, we have continued to see steady improvement, but no inflection point if that's where that question is leading, so there is a lot of visibility on the growth in the Eastern Hemisphere or internationally and to a large degree we are built into that.","Dave Lesar","Waqar, this is Dave. I would also add to that any tendering on large project still is tending to be very, very competitive.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","What will it take to change that kind of competitive pressure? What do you think the industry needs to see?","Jeff Miller","It would be a dislocation sort of event where there is inadequate capacity to meet demand, but I would say that as Dave said, the majority of the contracts are fairly large and there is a lot of visibility of those contracts, so I don't see kind of any surprises in the Eastern Hemisphere that would create that sort of supply\/demand dislocation.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Then vis-\u00e0-vis Brazil, you mentioned about rightsizing and you also mentioned if you need to get customer approval for that, but when do you think you will know one way or other whether you can right size there or not. What's the kind of timeline there?","Jeff Miller","Yes. We expect to see some of those answers into Q1. I would expect.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Hi, so we talked a little about on your last conference call. Can you give us your updated thoughts us on the U.S. pressure pumping markets and maybe we could reach equilibrium in conjunction with that on the Frac of the Future initiative given this competitive environment and the value to rolling out the Frac of the Future program at accelerated pace. As you are rolling out to this program, are you retiring or relocating equipments?","Dave Lesar","Yes. With respect to the Frac of the Future, we are continuing to roll that out and as we rolled it out, we have retired equipment or moved that equipment overseas, so yes we see value in continuing that program and getting the equipment into the market.","With respect to attrition sort on the back of current utilization in the North America, as we said there is about a 20%, we believe oversupply in the market now though we do see increasing drilling efficiency sort of the rate that is greater than increasing completion efficiency and because of that, we expect to see attrition continue. You know at what point that is? I expect, certainly out into next year, late next year or beyond though any spiking gas activity will certainly take that out very quickly.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Okay, so you are thinking at this time late this year or late 2014 or potentially even fairly 2015?","Dave Lesar","That's right.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Okay, and then as an unrelated follow up. Can you give us an update on your efforts to enter the artificial lift segment? I know you purchased a small artificial lift company some time ago. Are there other acquisition opportunities out there or do you think you can grow this business internally? And if you do grow it internally, how long do you think it will take to have critical mass in the segment?","Dave Lesar","Angie, this is Dave. Let me handle that one. We have talked over the couple of calls about the entry into artificial lift, especially ESPs. And I can tell you, it's a fantastic business. So it's one of our fastest growing businesses, although it's not big enough to move the needle for us right now but because we like it so much, we are going to look at both driving organic growth as well as bolt-on acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Thanks, good morning. On the Europe\/Africa\/CIS side, I notice that the C&P margins spiked this quarter. I was just wondering, is this from point forward product sales into the third quarter and therefore should we expect those margins to kind of head back into the mid-teens in the fourth quarter?","Mark McCollum","No. This is just on the back of the strengthening business, both completions and stimulation.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Okay, that's great. Okay, and I had one other question that is completely unrelated here, just on your Battle Red and Frac of the Future. I just wondered if you just help us conceptualize how the impact is going to play out here. Can you kind of tell us, if you look and say one of your frac fleet, say two years ago versus one of the new fleets today, where is the biggest difference here in terms of the cost and efficiency? You have talked about reducing labor. I am just wondering, is it the size of the frac spread, is it the reduced maintenance spending? Now you have been into this for a couple of years. Where do you see the biggest impact here?","Dave Lesar","Stay tuned for our Analyst Day, Dave. That's where we are going to lay it all out here in a couple of weeks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Good morning, guys.","Dave Lesar","Hey, Jim.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Your CapEx is significantly above your DD&A and has been for a while and it's significantly higher, on a ratio basis above your peers. Now you are generating fabulous returns on capital. So I am not claiming but can you explain to us why your CapEx versus your DD&A is so much higher than your peers.","Mark McCollum","I don't have enough insight into our peers to understand what they are doing on their capital spending. I know what drives ours. For a long time, we are spending a lot of maintenance cost on old fully depreciated equipment. So when we evaluate what we are doing, we are looking at maintenance cost and depreciation on a combined whole. So, yes, our depreciation is going up as we have new equipment we have relatively fast depreciation rates relative to useful lives of that equipment in terms of what we can do with it long-term and is driving our maintenance cost down on a percentage of revenue basis overall. So it's a zero some gain.","The other thing that we, of course, had to do over the last several years has made some fairly substantial investments in manufacturing, technology centers and fixed assets, basis of things around the world to position ourselves for the growth in Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America that we are achieving. So it may not look as productive but the fact is that's handy for being able to be there and to serve those customers in the places around the world. So that's been a fairly large percentage of our overall CapEx and that will probably continue as we continue to expand and in particularly in the unconventional market around the world over the next several years.","Dave Lesar","Yes, Jim, this is Dave. Let me just give you a little perspective on what's Mark saying. If you add up the amount that we have spent on manufacturing our big new facility in Singapore, our big new technology centers in Huston and in Saudi and Brazil, they are probably pushing a $1 billion just for those. Plus you add up the infrastructure we have built out in the U.S. to help our logistics and those are current cash flow, long-term depreciation, but I am telling you long-term payback things for Halliburton. So I think that we have had a spike in the fixed assets side of the business but they will pay off in the long run.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay. So I guess the returns you are generating, I am not complaining, but I was curious. My follow-up if I could, Battle Red. When we hear you have record revenues, but that you are laying people off, people get spooked. They think that's foreshadowing. Where's the Battle Red initiative? Where the layoffs being done as this all the U.S. initiative so far? I realize there initiatives, but can you kind of tell us where the targeted goal is in terms of people to where it's occurring, so we can have greater confidence that this isn't foreshadowing for some slowdown?","Dave Lesar","Yes. Jim, the bulk of that was in North America. It was geared around our efficiency drive and it was taking out basically as we have to do things more efficiently, we find that there are people that are excess, we are able to effectively do more efficient work in the back office. Also even at the co-pay, so our ability to relook at how efficiently we do work, so I would say that's not foreshadowing. What that is, is really coming to fruition sort of our confidence and the ability to execute the work either with fewer people or fewer people in the back-office.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning guys. Maybe I will stick with the Western Hemisphere as well, please, and start with a question that may feel little bit more open ended than I like, but let's see how you guys respond to it. I guess I am curious as '14 is shaping up for you. Whether you see the relative opportunity it's looking at things like reduce cluster spacing, higher sand per stage, some of things you have mentioned. I guess I am curious whether the opportunity seems more bent or more shaped by more customers of yours adopting those kinds of measures more aggressively or in other words sort of raising the averages, if you will, across the landscape or if it is a little bit more sort of rig count and well count-driven.","Dave Lesar","That is more customer-driven than that is rig count-driven. I think this is though just a view of how to get better frac propagation, what could be the technologies and so I would say it is a technical view more so than it is sort of the overall averages just moving up.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Okay, but more of your customers are applying some of those enhanced recovery, if you will, or enhanced techniques.","Dave Lesar","Brad, we have talked about in the past. It's really service intensity and it's sort of service intensity beyond just getting more fracs or more wells down per pad. It's actually now applying some of the new technologies that we have to make better wells, lower cost of BOE and make our customers more money, but also generate additional revenues for us. Then if the rig count kicks up on top of that, that would just the additional plus to the upside.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Great. Okay that's some fruitful thought. An unrelated follow-up. I just would appreciate some more clarity also on Mexico. If your current activity is declining at least onshore, first of all, is the jack-up market at all an offset here even as you hit early in '14?","Then secondly, can you maybe just give us an update on the mega tenders and if there has been any kind of delay in terms of your expectations and in terms of getting those awarded and again trying to place when some of that work might kick in for everybody?","Dave Lesar","Yes. I mean there are offset. That's a big market in Mexico, so there are offsets and there is offshore work that's being done, there is deepwater work that's being done. For example, the incentivized contract, so there are offsets in that market. With that said, the mega tenders are important, because it sort of refreshes budgets and resets the table in terms of work well in to the future.","As far as the timing of that goes, no, I am not surprised by where that stands. I mean, knew that that would be a large undertaking and take time for our client to get organized around how to put that out. Again, our view is sort of early Q2 is a realistic sort of startup time for that activity if things proceed as planned.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from of Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Jeff, you mentioned the completion efficiencies are increasing in a slower rate than the drilling efficiencies. Just hoping to get some order of magnitude here and what technologies should we be keeping an eye on that could flip this? In other words what technologies might make completion efficiencies outpace drilling efficiencies going forward in just perpetuating the oversupply in frac?","Jeff Miller","Yes, as we look at that, if we think that the drilling efficiencies up in that 20% range and we look at completion efficiency somewhat less than that, we will see it probably about in that 7%, 8% sort of efficiency in drilling that's outpacing the efficiency in completions. I think one of the things that tempers completion efficiency is going to be the size of jobs and the amount of activity requires completion actually get in some cases bigger rather than smaller and this where the frac purification [ph] happens. So again, my outlook is that we continue to add equipment over time as opposed to the other.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then Mark, you mentioned that North American margins would be down in the fourth quarter but not as bad as last year. Does this mean, for margins, we should be assuming a normal seasonal decline 50, 100 basis points, just on our numbers?","Mark McCollum","Yes, that's exactly what you should expect.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning.","Dave Lesar","Good morning. Hi, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","I am just curious. You guys have addressed the excess capacity situation. We continue to do this, it seems, on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Just wanted to get an update from you, as to your latest thought as to when you think the supply demand curves may balance? Any guesses on that in 2014?","Jeff Miller","Yes, this is Jeff. I would say, it is like 2014 or early '15 by the time when we start to see that tightening though as I just described, I do think that we are down the path that it consumes more equipment rather than adding more equipment.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and then you guys referenced some of your contract renewal and repricing and so on. In general what kind of magnitude of pricing pressures are you seeing at this point vis-\u00e0-vis your prior contracts?","Mark McCollum","For competitive reasons, that's something we just can't give.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay.","Mark McCollum","Sorry.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","No, fair enough. Alright, That's it for me. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question come from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Good morning. You said in, I think, your press release that you had lower profits from Iraq and then you stated on your call about the new contract ending. I thought you had written that down to breakeven anyway? Could you reconcile that for me?","Mark McCollum","Now, Jim, what happened in the second quarter, as we really made a hard push to get that contract done at the end of the second quarter. It's built over a little bit but the reality of that push, it increased our profitability on that contract as we took it across the finish line. Now it's over and while there is a little bit of work left, a very small phase two, we finished that first phase of those big contracts, the initial awarded contracts. So it hasn't impacted in reducing the overall profitability in Iraq overall. But that isn't to say that we are losing money there. Just the opposite. In fact, as we go forward on our new contracts, we are trying to be very, very disciplined about the work that we take on and making sure that it continues to improve our profitability in that region going forward. It is magnitude as always and not the margins.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Mark, how do you see the overall levels of activity trending for Halliburton in Iraq going forward?","Dave Lesar","Go ahead, Jeff.","Jeff Miller","Yes. I have got a positive outlook on our activity as we go into 2014. So what I would say is, we are much more disciplined around the contracts that we pursue and the terms under which we will accept them, so it's returns and margins first as opposed to top line growth and we have been, as I said very disciplined about that, so I am confident that we will grow that business, but again grow business that we can all be happy with.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Okay. Just one quick follow-up. Did you say that the price deterioration that you are seeing in the U.S. and that you expect in the U.S. is frac-only and are there any other product lines in the quarter which experienced price deterioration in the U.S.?","Jeff Miller","Jim, this is Jeff. No. I would say that the pricing pressure we see is more widespread than just fracturing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Hi. Good morning. With Q4 a heavier time of the year for contract rollovers in the frac market and spot crews for the industry generally is just not making any money. I think it's obviously contracts will be a bit more competitive. Can you just talk about how your strategy as you go into these rollovers, how you think to differentiate yourselves?","Dave Lesar","From a differentiation standpoint, Jeff, we absolutely believe that in our ability to deliver efficiency with that technology I won't through them with PermStim, but a whole range of chemistry technologies and others that absolutely differentiate Halliburton in the market, so we look at contracts in any sort of environment those are the things that we turn to and that our clients count on Halliburton to do.","Jeff Miller","The competition that varies basin-to-basin and so depending on the amount of capacity that's there, the complexity of the reservoir, we can make a different value proposition with customers on differentiation. In some cases, where they have gone off and the customer has experienced what someone else has done we have been able to take that fork back at a little bit higher price.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Then around (inaudible). It's been focused my understanding, mostly North America with the successes you are having there. Any reason to think you won't continue this push globally?","Dave Lesar","No.","Jeff Miller","No. We expect that as we go into '14 and beyond, we will be staging the rollout once we kind of get all the kings out in the North America, the rest of the world is ready to go and so we will be rolling those out over time although probably at a slightly slower space than we used for the North America rollout just given its size and complexity.","Kelly Youngblood","Sam, we believe we have time for one more caller.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our final question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein","Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Back on the domestic frac market, pricing continues to decline, but it appears that the operating margins for the industry is actually up. Is it fair to say that the primary driver of the pricing weakness today is a willingness by the pumpers to actually lower rates to improve asset turns via these 24-hour services? My question is actually would we still be seeing pricing declines if there wasn't a trend toward more 24-hour work?","Dave Lesar","The question was would we see a decline without the 24-hour work. It's an interesting question. Scott, I don't know for sure whether we would know that or not, because obviously you can't ever exactly know what motivates our competitors to sort of come in with the pricing that they do, but I do think that often times what we are seeing is guys really wanting to get equipment to work and willing to take a lower price if that's necessary to do that. The question always is, okay, but are they really creating the value for the customer.","In our sort of overall value proposition, we are always focused on. It's not just the cost per stage to the customer, but what are they achieving on an increased production, driving down the overall cost on a per BOE basis, and when customers get focused on that, I think that the results begin to change in our favor.","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein","Well, are you still seeing declines in pricing for single spot wells? Can you identify contracts, new incremental 24-hour work with the pricing pressure is a lot more severe as pumpers compete for that work? Is the asset turn improvements huge.","Dave Lesar","Well I guess what I will say is we don't typically, I mean we don't pursue that one off market that you just described. And so I would, just from competitive standpoint, I wouldn't walk through our contracts and our pricing on those different contracts. So suffice to say, that we tend to work in a more contracted fashion but we are on a longer period of time.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time I will turn the call back to management for any closing comments.","Dave Lesar","Yes, before closing the call, I just want to remind everybody that on November 6, we will be having our Analyst Day and it will be webcast. You will be able to access the webcast link from the Investor Relations page on halliburton.com.","And with that Sam, I will turn it back over to you to close up call.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Thank you, Sam. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton's fourth quarter 2013 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days.

We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2013. First, I\u2019m very proud to say that we delivered industry leading international revenue growth in 2013, specifically for the full year our Eastern Hemisphere grew a remarkable 17% with profit growth of 23%. That coupled with a solid year in North America resulted in a record year for the Company with revenue totaling $29.4 billion.","We also set new revenue records this year in all of our international regions and in both of our divisions. From an operating income perspective we achieved new full year records in our Middle East, Asia region and in six of our 13 product lines. I want to express my gratitude to our 77,000 employees around the globe for their hard work and dedication that helped us deliver these outstanding results.","In 2013 we also demonstrated our strong commitment to delivering superior shareholder returns. We repurchased approximately $4.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares. We had also increased our dividend twice during the year for a total payout increase of 67% over our 2012 dividend rate. These actions reflect our continued confidence in the strength of our business outlook. We have been and will continue to be relentlessly focused on delivering consistent execution and best-in-class returns.","Our strategy has worked well for us and we intend to stay the course. The cornerstones of our strategy remain unchanged, expanding our share within the deepwater market, helping our customers maximize recovery from mature fields and leading in global unconventional development.","We believe that these are sustainable growth segments for Halliburton which will allow us to generate superior revenue growth, margins and returns. So I think we had a really good year given what the market gave us.","Now before we delve deeper into the fourth quarter, I think I should cut right to the chase and look at how we believe 2014 will play out. I think that will help provide you with some context for the rest of today\u2019s discussion.","So let\u2019s start with our 2014 view for all of Halliburton Company. Let me begin by saying that we\u2019re very optimistic about the coming year and our ability to achieve robust revenue and operating income growth for the total company.","As we look at the 2014 landscape today, we see the following. Based on customer surveys and some discussions with customers, we see total customer drilling and completion spending increasing by the mid to upper single digit percentages with higher spending percentage increases in the Eastern Hemisphere and a bit lower in North America.","However, from Halliburton revenue standpoint, we believe we will outpace the market rate of spending increases in both the Eastern Hemisphere and North America and revenue growth for the full year could approach double-digits. We also believe that overall margins will take a step higher both in Eastern Hemisphere and North America. These expectations provide to framework for our current 2014 operating plan, which reflects continued superior returns, significant higher cash generations, and solid double-digit growth in earnings per share.","Now let me do a little bit deeper dive into our outlook and the major market segments. In the Eastern Hemisphere for 2014 we anticipate customer spend to be largely driven by our NOC customers.","With the contracts we have in hand, we\u2019re planning on low double-digit revenue growth for the Hemisphere led by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China and Australia and our Middle East and Asia businesses, and by Russia and Angola and our Europe, Africa, CIS region. We also anticipate 2014 Eastern Hemisphere margins to take a step higher quarter-over-quarter when compared to 2013, approaching 20% by year-end and averaging in the upper teens for the year.","In 2013, North America played out as we predicted. We saw market driven by increased drilling and completion efficiencies with a relatively flat overall rig count and industry overcapacity.","The volatility of the past few years is evolved into a more stable market environment. In the fourth quarter of 2012, if you recall, we called the bottom on our North America margins and we were right. We've seen a marked improvement in margins since that time.","For 2014 we are now forecasting U.S. spending to increase in the mid-single digit range based on recent moderations in liquids pricing outlook. Of course, we naturally believe our growth rates will exceed that increase in customer spend, given our strong position in North America.","On the margin front for North America, we believe that over the course of the year, we will see our margins increase about 200 basis points. We expect the U.S. land rig count to modestly increase in 2014, driven primarily by the continued shift to horizontals in the Permian basin. The Permian started 2013 with less than 35% of the rig count running horizontal, but we anticipate more than half the rig count will be horizontal by the end of 2014.","We also expect to see a continued trend in higher well efficiencies due to increased pad drilling, more 24-hour operations, rig fleet upgrades and significant advancements in drilling and completion technologies.","In 2013 we saw average drilling days per horizontal well drop by approximately 14% compared to 2012 and we anticipate horizontal drilling efficiencies to again improve in the mid to upper single digits in 2014.","Storage levels are back near the five-year average, but production levels remained elevated both with associated gas in the liquids plays as well as some continued robust activity in the Marcellus basin. Continued strength in natural gas prices could provide some upside potential, but we are not optimistic there will be a meaningful uptick in gas activities in the near term.","With regards to Latin America, we expect 2014 to be a challenging year, with fairly steady activity in all countries, expect Mexico and Brazil, both of which are in transition. As previously communicated, Brazil deepwater drilling activity levels have been both expectations and our expected to be even worst throughout 2014.","Petrobras has recently said the deepwater rig count for 2014 will be even less than the already depressed levels of 2013. The entire services industry in Brazil is looking for relief to the over capitalization as that has occurred there in anticipation of a much higher deepwater rig count. No relief has been forthcoming at this point.","We have an excellent long-term contract position in Brazil and I still believe it will pay off in the long run, but for now the depreciation and personnel costs of our high capital investment is having a severe downward pressure on Brazil margins. However, we intend to stay the course and with Petrobras to try to gain some relief over the next several quarters.","In Mexico, reduced activity levels on land are expected to continue through the first half of 2014, as we transition from our prior South Alliance 2 projects to already identified new opportunities in the country. Last quarter we announced the win of the largest incentivized project contract called Humapa, and I am pleased to say today that based on the preliminary tender results, we are also positioned to win Mesozoic 1, the largest of the integrated mega tender projects.","These large contract wins will result in higher revenues in Mexico, but the mobilization for them will take some time. In the meantime, I've made the decision to not reduce our headcount or support costs as these resources will soon be needed on these projects, hopefully by the third quarter. Therefore, this ongoing cost will go directly against our profitability until the revenue stream starts back up.","In addition, last year, PEMEX pushed the annual software and consulting blanket order approval process back further into the year, delaying their release until its third and fourth quarters. While it is difficult to predict whether this typical approval process is the new norm, we do know that we will be expanding our consulting work with PEMEX in 2014 and beyond. This could result in us incurring costs that will directly hit our process until the blanket order is signed and revenue can be recognized.","Both of these items are transitory in nature, but will clearly lay in our profitability in Mexico for probably the first six months of 2014. And while this is not an optimal outcome, I do strongly believe this approach is in the best interest of our company for the long-term success of our business in Mexico, a market we believe has long-term sustainable value to us.","So we are strongly committed to both Mexico and Brazil through this transition period. We believe these issues are short-term bumps on the road, but because of their margins for the Latin America region, we'll likely be in the upward single digits until activity begins to recover in the back half of the year. Over the long-term though, Latin America is expected to an outstanding growth market for us and Jeff will give you some details on that in a bit.","So overall our strategy is working well. We intend to stay the course in the coming year. I am optimistic about our ability to grow North American revenue and margins, realize industry leading revenue and margin growth in our international business, which should result in double-digit EPS growth. We also remain focused on consistent execution, superior financial performance and industry-leading returns.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff and he'll give you some operational details.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results. Overall, I'm pleased with our operational results. Total company revenue of 7.6 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton with operating income of 1.2 billion. We achieved record revenues this quarter in our completion tools, multi-chem landmark, wireline and perforating and testing product lines. During the quarter, our landmark and testing product lines also set new operating income records.","Turning to the geographies, our Eastern Hemisphere has record revenue for the quarter with 14% year-over-year growth, while operating income grew 10% for the same period. Sequentially, East Hemisphere revenue and operating income improved 8% and 14%, respectively, driven by our Middle East Asia region.","Relative to the third quarter, Europe, Africa, CIS grew by 4% with slightly higher operating income despite some modest weather issues in the North Sea. The UK led the improvement with increased drilling and offshore wireline activity. Also contributing to the growth was increased stimulation in Boots & Coots activity in Algeria and seasonally higher year-end software sales in Russia and throughout Continental Europe. Partially offsetting the growth was lower drilling and wireline activity in Egypt.","In Angola, we performed our first pre-salt deepwater open-hole logging jobs in the country on two wells for Cobalt International. Our open-hole wireline logging suite of tools including nuclear magnetic resonance, imaging, coring, seismic and reservoir formation pressure testing and sampling services delivered high quality petrophysical, geophysical and reservoir information for our customer.","We also used our ICE Core fluid analysis technology which debuted in the fourth quarter. We continue to build customer confidence in our technology and formation evaluation capability through jobs like this, and the recent successes logging deepwater discovery wells elsewhere in Africa.","In the Middle East Asia region, compared to the prior quarter, revenue and operating income grew by 12% and 28%, respectively. Seasonal year-end software and equipment sales led the improvement for the quarter followed by higher stimulation activity in Australia and increased drilling activity in Malaysia and Thailand.","In Indonesia, we received two major project wins in the quarter. The first is a three-year project management win valued at over $200 million to oversee the drilling, logging and testing of challenging high pressure, high temperature geothermal wells. This is the testimony to Halliburton's unique leadership in delivering high pressure, high temperature solutions.","The second win is a series of contracts to provide directional drilling, wireline and completion services in a multi-field deepwater project over five years. This is expected to be the largest development today in Indonesia. Also during the quarter, Halliburton successfully completed the first -- the industries first fully acoustic telemetry controlled and monitored deepwater drill stem test. Using our DynaLink Wireless Telemetry System, we send acoustic control signals down hole operating the well test valves and fluid sampling system while also receiving real time reservoir data at surface.","The enhanced flexibility and control during this operation saved our customer five rig days. This advancement along with deepwater contract wins in Indonesia and Angola reflect our leading global completions position and our evolution towards becoming a compelling choice for deepwater drilling and evaluation services. As we deploy new technologies into the Eastern Hemisphere we\u2019re seeing strategic upsell opportunities within our existing contracts and have been able to increase pricing accordingly with new contracts.","Turning to Latin America; revenue and operating income were essentially flat compared to the third quarter. This is the net result of higher yearend software sales, increased cementing activity and the recognition of a value added tax refund receivable in Brazil which offset a decline in activity related to our Mexico Southern Alliance 2 contract. As discussed on our last earnings call activity levels on the Southern Alliance 2 project has declined meaningfully as PEMEX ramps down the ongoing IPM work in preparation for the mega tender projects. We averaged only three rigs for the Southern Alliance 2 project during the fourth quarter as compared to seven rig average in the third quarter. Further we expect to average two rigs on those project in the first half of 2014.","Looking at the Mexico mega tenders, the number of projects tendered dropped from 8 to 10 resulting in only three ATG projects in Northern Mexico plus the original five projects in the south. The remaining ATG projects were also smaller in scope than initially expected. Based on the preliminary results of the bid opening, we are positioned to be awarded work in the Mesozoic, the largest single contract in the mega tender round. The ATG and tertiary projects are the least technically challenging of the tenders and have the highest number of submitted bids. Who would not have been interested in doing these projects at the pricing we saw it took to win them. The Mesozoic work by contrast has extremely complex geology resulting in fewer qualified bidders and will likely result in better margins and returns.","As we said before, we are very selective on the integrated projects that we pursue. As a return\u2019s driven organization, we\u2019re only interested in winning work that generates superior margins and returns. We believe that the Mesozoic project and the Humapa contract that will begin in the second quarter that\u2019s squarely in this economic profile. We look forward to the formal award of the mega tenders in the first quarter, mobilization to begin in the second and in full activity levels in the back half of 2014. And in Brazil as Dave said, we saw a significant reduction in drilling activity over the course of 2013.","We believe that 2014 will be a very challenging year for Latin America. The uncertainty around the timing of when we will be able to right-size our cost structure in Brazil coupled with the delays to the submission of the mega tenders in Mexico have meet our growth expectations for 2014. Ultimately however this does not change our long-term outlook for Latin America. The transition to the mega tenders in Mexico in conjunction with the start up of our incentivized Humapa contract gives us confidence that activity levels in Mexico will recover as these areas get underway. And in Brazil although drilling activity could continue to decline in the near term, our recent contract wins have a potential term of up to eight years and we believe higher drilling activity levels will resume. Over the long-term we expect both of these countries to continue to be strong contributors to our growth and profitability.","Switching to North America, weather related activity disruptions resulted in sequential drop in both revenue and operating income. However activity levels were stronger than expected during the holiday season which helped to minimize that sequential decline. We executed our highest U.S. base count of the year in the month of October and activity levels remain strong throughout most of September before declining during the holidays. Several areas including the Bakken, Permian Basin and Marcellus got off to a slow start in January due to weather disruptions, but activity levels have since resent. We expect first quarter activity levels to be similar to the fourth quarter as our completions calendar is looking very active over the coming months; however this outlook is subject to additional weather delays notably end markets like the Rockies where we have a large market share of position. In addition, we also renewed a number of long-term contracts in the fourth quarter with price concessions that will take effect during the first quarter.","Looking ahead our customers continue to focus on horizontal drilling efficiency and multi-well pad operations. Pad wells account for over half our activity today and even in the Permian the last area to shift the horizontal drilling, pad activity is estimated to be over 20% in both the Midland and Delaware Basins. These market conditions underscore the need for our HALvantage initiatives. As you know HALvantage includes Frac of the Future and Battle Red as well as other strategic cost oriented programs. We continue to deploy Q10\u2019s and SandCastle\u2019s into the market and expect to see our fleet cross the 20% mark in the first quarter. The Battle Red program meanwhile is expected to be deployed into over half of our North American operations by the end of the first quarter including the frontline smartphone technology. Once we have a couple of quarters behind this, we intend to provide a more in-depth assessment of the HALvantage rollout.","At this time I\u2019d like to give you an update on CYPHER; our Seismic-to-Stimulation Service. CYPHER was launched publicly in the fourth quarter and today we have over two dozen programs running for a number of customers across the major basins. In November we summarized the results of our early tests where we averaged over 20% improvement in production in North America. Today I would like to highlight one of our pilot projects which recently completed its first year. Our customer had a series of underperforming wells in a Barnett asset and Halliburton was engaged to invigorate its program. The first step was to build an earth model from existing seismic, log and core data as well as production results. This phase identified a number of sweet spots including several that have been bypassed in the initial well placement. By understanding where to drill and where to land the wells, the second phase yielded over a 50% uplift and estimated ultimate recovery or EUR per well, and the average CYPHER well produced at a level beyond the best pre existing wells.","Our next step was maximizing fracture complexity and production. With each iterative well, the CYPHER service was using Halliburton\u2019s proprietary complex fracture model to learn where to complete the well and then how to complete the well. By the conclusion of the third phase CYPHER had more than doubled the average EUR per well. One year later CYPHER has clearly demonstrated its value. Through the smart service we\u2019re working with the client to continuously incorporate new technology and techniques to improve production not only in this asset but on several others. We believe that CYPHER is a game changer for our customers and for Halliburton. We will change the way we go to market and will significantly differentiate us in the North American frac market.","We\u2019re also seeing a consistent adoption of our Custom Chemistry Solutions, including our RockPerm service and it's associated OilPerm Formation Mobility Modifiers. Through RockPerm we demonstrate to our customers how a customized affected package including OilPerm can generate appreciable production improvements compared to offset wells. Since beginning field trials in the second quarter of 2013, Halliburton has utilized RockPerm and OilPerm on over 2000 jobs.","Moving to the Gulf of Mexico, we saw sequential revenue and profit improvement from increased drilling activity and the return of one of our larger simulation vessels to service. Going into 2014, we believe we are well positioned with drilling and evaluation of services for the additional 14 to 16 deepwater rigs that are scheduled to arrive during the year. We are also optimistic about the higher levels of completion sales during 2014 given our strong market position in both deepwater and lower tertiary completions.","To close out North America, we believe the current environment continues to favor Halliburton. There are two key differentiators with our customers today; efficient, reliable execution and improved production. We believe these trends play the Halliburton strengths as the leading service provider in North America and that our HALvantage and CYPHER initiatives give us a clear competitive advantage.","Based on early signals from our customers, we're optimistic about the activity outlook for 2014 and we'll continue to be relentlessly focused on our cost structure to enable margin growth in the coming year.","Internationally, we're very pleased with our year-over-year growth in spite of activity headwinds in Latin America. We've led our peer group in delivering international revenue growth and expect to continue to expand our global business in 2014.","We believe that continued above-market rate growth will be driven by recent wins and new projects, markets where we've made strategic investments from the introduction of new technology and from modest pricing increases and cost recovery on select contracts.","Now Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As mentioned last quarter, we've been evaluating our cost structure within the organization as we deploy our HALvantage corporate initiatives. These initiatives are having a significant impact on the support and operational headcount needs primarily in North America, as well as equipment and inventory requirements.","During the fourth quarter, as we progressed with the rollout of these initiatives, we took further restructuring actions which resulted in severance and other charges during the quarter of approximately $38 million before tax. Our corporate and other expense totaled $99 million this quarter and included approximately $22 million for continued investment in these HALvantage strategic initiatives. These activities will continue throughout 2014, but the related costs should begin to decline in the second half of the year.","We anticipate the impact of these investments will again be approximately $0.02 per share after tax in the first quarter. Including these strategic costs, we anticipate that corporate expenses for the first quarter will be in line with the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in lower than anticipated at 26% due to some favorable tax items in Latin America, but our tax rate does continue to fall as our international taxable earnings continue to grow. As we go forward into 2014, we're expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 29% which is about 100 basis points than our normalized rate as we exit 2013. This is driven solely by the exploration of the federal research and experimentation tax credit, which we hope will be reapproved by Congress sometime in 2014.","Cash flows from operating activities in 2013 were approximately $4.4 billion, representing growth of 22% compared to the prior year. We also generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash adjusted for stock repurchases and a new debt we issued last year. And moving in 2014, we believe we're well positioned to generate significantly more cash and that it will grow sustainably in the coming years.","We have previously committed to grow the percentage of cash available for distribution to shareholders up to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which has nearly doubled our historic trend. And based on our 2013 results, we're well on our way toward achieving this goal.","We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately $3 billion which is generally consistent with our 2013 spending level. We expect our international spend to continue to outweigh our North America's spend in 2014. We also expect our 2014 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.2 billion.","During the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved the 20% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.125 to $0.15 per share. This was the second dividend increase in 2013 representing a cumulative 67% increase over our quarterly dividend rate in 2012. As announced earlier in 2013, our intention going forward is for our dividend payout to equal at least 15% to 20% of our net income.","Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.7 billion in share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors that is available to use for stock buybacks. As we moved into 2014, we're anticipating a seasonal sequential decline in international revenue and margins during the first quarter, due to reduced software and equipment sales as well as weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Eurasia and Australia.","On a year-over-year basis for the first quarter, we anticipate an upper single digit percentage increase in the Eastern Hemisphere revenue with the modest improvement in margins which is evidence of our expanding international market position. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect Eastern Hemisphere activity levels to recover from the seasonal impact and margins to steadily improve over the course of the year with full year margins averaging in the upper teens.","For the Latin America, we expect a seasonal decline in first quarter revenue and margins to be more severe than normal, due to our elevated cost structure in Brazil and the ramp down of the Mexico Southern Alliance 2 project as Jeff discussed a little bit ago. Also, as Dave discussed, the sequential decline is also exacerbated by the timing of our annual consulting blanket order renewal in Mexico.","We're currently expecting a mid teens sequential decline in revenue in the first quarter and margins in Latin America to be in the upper single digits. At this time it's difficult to provide full year guidance for Latin America until we hear the outcome of the negotiations with our customer in Brazil and receive formal contract awards in Mexico.","Concluding with North America, we're anticipating a typical weather impact in the first quarter plus some additional pricing pressure for contract renewals that went into effect at the beginning of 2014. Subject to severe weather disruptions, we're currently expecting first quarter revenue and margins in North America to be in line with the fourth quarter of 2013.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments.","Dave Lesar","Thanks, Mark. Just in a quick summary, we executed very well in 2013. I believe we had a good year with what the market gave us and delivered what we said we would. Bottom line for 2014 is we expect all of this to translate into double-digit EPS growth.","So with that, let's turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dave Lesar","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Remind to write-off Latin America as my vacation spot for this year. The CapEx that you guys have spent over the last couple of years, primarily in the Eastern Hemisphere setting up locations, et cetera, that we kind of looked at as some costs, are we going to see an improvement in performance on the basis of that this year? Does that kick-in on a noticeable basis this year, the ability to win projects on more of a variable basis than a fully move into the country for the first-time basis?","Dave Lesar","Yes, we should start seeing that Jim. The initial investment was to get placed in and at this point now that we have the facilities build out, we are \u2013 the incremental projects that come along are being bid at sort of the rates that we would expect to recover. And then as we absorb those costs with additional work, again we'll continue to see the improvement in margins.","Mark McCollum","Part of that, Jim, is why I think we're so confident that Eastern Hemisphere is going to continue to step-up quarter-over-quarter in its margin realizations because to some extent you are now covering those fixed costs with a wider contract base.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Guys, I just think that's a story that people kind of forget that that's one of the drivers. Okay, and second if I could, record revenues in the entire Eastern Hemisphere, usually if I'm head of Eastern Hemisphere, Dave, and you ask me what am I going to do this year, and me saying, I hope customers spend more, probably doesn't get me a promotion. When you're operating at record revenue level in order to increase returns, don't you have to at some level take some additional risk?","Dave Lesar","Well, I'm not sure what you mean by risk, but let me take a shot at this. I mean obviously our Eastern Hemisphere is doing well and Joe Rainey who heads that up and his management team, are doing a fantastic job for us. I think really to continue to grow Eastern Hemisphere, one obviously you have to take what the market gives you. And we're seeing some sort of modest level increase in rig count there. So that will help grow the revenue. You have to win more than your normal market share which I believe we\u2019re doing in terms of tender and contract win rates. I\u2019m not sure you necessarily have to take higher risks in your contract pricing. You really have to pick and choose your spots and we have as we said when we responded to the first question we also have a larger footprint in the Eastern Hemisphere now to attack the market off of. So I don\u2019t necessarily think we have to take risk to continue to grow our Eastern Hemisphere business, I think we\u2019re well positioned there. It\u2019s a contract base. We have a great footprint, we have a great management team and I think that will all drive the revenues higher.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay. Gentlemen, thank you very much.","Dave Lesar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Dave Lesar","Good morning, Brad.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","Maybe I could ask you to as you think about \u201914 for us, just cut up the business a couple of different ways that you have done so in the past. How would you look at offshore growth internationally or maybe in the Eastern Hemisphere versus onshore growth? It just -- it sounds like a lot of the opportunities you identified were actually onshore or onshore driven for \u201914?","Dave Lesar","I think it\u2019s a healthy mix of both Brad. The offshore rig count we see that continuing to grow and obviously one of our clear strategies is to outgrow the deepwater market which we expect to do, but yes there are number of onshore opportunities as well. We think about Russia and China and then certainly the Middle East. So there is a robust onshore market out there. So I think that they\u2019re evenly weighted and I wouldn\u2019t take one over the other.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","I mean when you clearly think about the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico should have a good solid growth here on 2014. Now we did say them at Brazil likely is going to be flat slightly down and that is somewhat of a disappointment and sees 2015 being more of a transition year. But you step away from Brazil, the rest of it -- that offshore market should be good?","Dave Lesar","Yes.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful color. Asking a similar question, but slightly different than your -- as you\u2019ve identified your Brownfield strategy which I know is a multi-year strategy, but how does that in your minds grow in \u201914 versus more traditional sort of Greenfield drilling and completion work?","Dave Lesar","Well, we see the first step out in Mexico. So as we get into 2014, we see Humapa getting ramped up and so we will see contributions there. We are selective around these projects as we take them. We expect to add a few projects per year. Clearly, Humapa being one of those and we have got a number of other sort of things in the works. So expect that to start contributing this year.","Mark McCollum","I think let me also sort of respond from a capital investment standpoint. We are going to be putting more capital in 2014 into our businesses that orient towards the mature fields strategy both the chemicals, artificial lift and expanding our footprint there both in North America and around the world and then continue to build out tools and other equipment to support what we see as a coming Brownfield opportunity in North America.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","That\u2019s helpful. If I may, within that I think you identified -- within the Brownfield strategy, I think you identified a couple of offshore opportunities for example offshore Norway. Do you see those as progressing? On other words, is ICO spending in some meaningful way shifting to production enhancement? Is that generating some incremental opportunity for you as you tender today?","Dave Lesar","Yes, we see some of that though I would say it\u2019s probably more focused with the national oil companies than it is the IOC. So it\u2019s given kind of the type of investment profile I believe that they have. There are some offshore opportunities, but in terms of the kind of consolidated or we manage all of the activities, those types of things, those are less focused offshore and certainly more focused onshore.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from of Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I want to clarify the North American revenue guidance a little bit. In the press release you mentioned mid single-digit growth, in the prepared remarks talking about spending in mid single-digits and that you generally outperform underlying spending. I just want to reconcile those comments for North American revenue growth?","Dave Lesar","Yes, this is Dave. Let me take that -- let me sort of attack it a couple of ways. One is that when we look at sort of what our customers are saying about spending in 2014, you sort of settle in the mid single-digit range. If you look at sort of where we believe the rate count is going, which is up a little, if you look at well count efficiencies which will be up in sort of the mid, maybe upper single-digits and then you can drive revenues sort of off of either of those. I think the important point is that we believe our revenue because of our position in North America it\u2019s going to exceed whatever the market gives us. But we have -- all we can do at this point is gauge off what our customers are telling us they\u2019re going to spend and what they say is sort of the mid single-digits. As I said we will beat that because of our position. We know the rate count will go up a little. We know that efficiency is going to be better. All of that bodes well for us, but we\u2019re just trying to give you a number of data points by which you can then plug in your own growth expectations and then just add some on top of that for what you think will do.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So you wouldn\u2019t be balking at say 7% to 9% revenue growth figure?","Dave Lesar","I\u2019m not going to let you pin me down that specifically. Although I\u2019m saying is whatever the market is we\u2019re going to outgrow it.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Another one, I appreciate the difficulty in looking at Latin America growth for the full year. Are you able to give us some perspective of if there is a relief in Brazil, if the latest award or expected award actually starts ramping up in the second half. Are you able to just give some rough gauge about how big a deal those two instances could be for revenue and margins?","Mark McCollum","Yes.","Dave Lesar","Go ahead.","Mark McCollum","Yes, the -- not calling anything on the first half of the year, but if you look at the full year, those are meaningful projects in Mexico. So there is some upside in terms of growth for the full year, but we need to see those get started and work being done on those. But again we will know a lot more about this as we get further into the year.","Dave Lesar","The way I would probably also add to that is that as I think about the year, the revenue growth number is very difficult to pin. Clearly we talk about Brazil being lower, Mexico may have a late ramp in revenues, but what it does really make a difference in is for our margins, and -- we typically would like to talk about our international margins being in the upper teens and -- but Eastern Hemisphere is clearly on its way. I see some relief on the cost pressure of Brazil and Mexico activities beginning to solidify going forward. It gives us the opportunity to get our margins in Latin America back on track with the rest of the international markets and drive up in those upper teens.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the PEMEX mega tender a little bit. You said it was reduced from 10 down to 8. I\u2019m just kind of curious what do you think the rationale was? Where those maybe the five ATG projects? I didn\u2019t quite hear you on kind of how you articulated that.","Dave Lesar","Yes, initially there were 10 mega tender projects that were to be tendered. That number resulted in eight in the end and of those eight the reduction were in the ATG or Northern Mexico projects. Expectation is that\u2019s on the back of really reform. The reform in Mexico is going to be net net, a very positive event for the service industry. But over the near-term there is a milestones and things that would appear will slowdown the investment or at least sort of the decisions around some more potentially over the near-term. So I think that was one of the drivers in terms of a smaller sort of scope overall. I think the total sort of expectation number there was around $3.5 billion which initially has been expected in the $9 billion to $10 billion kind of range.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Right. So now were the terms on -- how are the terms end up on these contracts compared to what you\u2019re expecting? It sounds like they were worsen you were thinking. Is that fair -- because if I heard you right, it sounds like you\u2019re really -- you are only expecting to win the Mesozoic contract, is that correct?","Dave Lesar","Now that\u2019s correct. Now the terms were \u2013 the terms were consistent with what we expected to see. I think we were little surprised by some of the pricing that we saw. I got to think even that there were fewer contracts to go after and there were number of bidders in the bidding for the ATG projects, but pricing on those was significantly down and surprisingly down. And that was just one of those where we\u2019ve -- that was not acceptable pricing for the type of projects that they are.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Got it. Now that Mesozoic is, just correct me if I'm wrong, that's essentially the extension of the Alliance 2 project. So you already have everything mobilized in-country, so it's just a question of that cost absorption. You don't have to ramp up in the country, correct?","Mark McCollum","No, we don't have to ramp up. It's not really an extension of the Alliance 2 project, but we have the people, the kit, all of the resources in-country. We'll need some rigs to work with us. But outside the rigs, we're ready to go.","Dave Lesar","I think David, this is David, think of it as we have the resources and people in-country. It's just that as South Alliance ramps down, those people will not have anything to do, that resource will not have anything to do for a period of time until the next contracts, Humapa and Mesozoic, ramp back up. So rather than do a massive layoff and cost reduction and have to turn around and hire the people straight back, we're just going to absorb the costs in the meantime. So we will not have to add very much incremental costs in terms of where we have been. It's just a way underutilized resource for a couple of quarter period of time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now opened.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Great. Good morning, guys.","Dave Lesar","Good morning, Angie.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Hi. So could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in pressure pumping as far as pricing? Clearly, you had contracts that were being renegotiated in Q4 and we're seeing a little bit of that in Q1. Do you think that pricing could continue to be under pressure into Q2? Have you actually seen an intensification of competition? One of your largest peers mentioned some market share gains, so can you talk about what you're seeing in the market?","Mark McCollum","We're seeing continued pricing pressure certainly in the market. And so as we go into looking at contracts and pricing, one of the first things we look at, are the customers where we can be the most efficient and execute our value proposition. But the market is clearly competitive.","Dave Lesar","I would also add, Angie, with respect to market share gains, it's not coming out of our hide, that's for sure. Yes, there is plenty of stacked equipment out there. There's a bit of flight to quality that goes on in this kind of market and even though pricing is challenged, as Jeff has said, and there is some market share shift going on, it's sure not coming out of ours.","Mark McCollum","I want to reiterate that the 200 basis points of margin improvement in North America for us is net of pricing. So while we assume that pricing will continue to be weak for us, we're working hard to make sure that that does not influence our margins negatively during the year.","Angie Sedita - UBS","All right. Yes, I assumed as much that your market share would not be affected. I guess going to that point, Mark, on the 200 basis point gain in North America. Is that gain in margin weighted to the back half of the year given your mark for Q1? And are you able to quantify yet of that 200 basis points how much is from internal measures, the Battle Red and the Frac of the Future?","Mark McCollum","Well, it's not that I can't yet articulate how we're going to get there, but I don't know that I want to necessarily for public consumption. But it is our view that as we go through the year, the margins will stair-step higher across 2014. It's a cumulative 200 basis points of margin addition. And so we'll realize it as we get into the end of the third quarter which is typically our highest margin quarter. But it should stair-step higher in Q1 and Q2 as well on a year-over-year basis and sequentially.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Okay. And then as a unrelated follow-up on the international markets, clearly 2013 was pretty impressive where you outpaced your peers on the revenue side and operating income. And I thought, Dave, you said you expect to see the same in 2014. Can you talk about where on a relative basis do you expect to outpace your peers? And is this a combination of market share and new technologies or greater market penetration of some markets?","Dave Lesar","I think, Angie, it's really all of the above. I don't want to highlight a certain region or that region all of a sudden gets a big target put on its back. But I would say generally, we're really pleased with where we are in terms of our Eastern Hemisphere market penetration contract win rate, introduction of new technology. So I would just leave it as it's \u2013 I'm pretty happy all the way across the board.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now opened.","James West - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Dave Lesar","Good morning, James.","James West - Barclays Capital","Dave, a bigger picture question for you on North America. You talked about well efficiencies last year. I think you said 14% and you're expecting high single-digits this year. Where do you think we are in this cycle of well efficiencies and how much more do we have to go where the well count can really outpace the rig count, et cetera? It seems like we're starting to slow down on that.","Dave Lesar","I think clearly the low-hanging fruit has been picked. Right now, I don't see any reason why we will not continue to get year-over-year well count efficiencies. You're starting to see sort of a massive upgrade to the rig fleet that's out there. The move to pad drilling, obviously I think is one of the real drivers we saw last year in terms of the efficiency gains. But as I mentioned in my remarks, the Permian now is switching from what was really a vertical to a horizontal market and there are a lot of rigs running in the Permian right now. And I think that gives us confidence in driving the numbers for 2014 and even beyond that, because let's say the Permian's only at 50% at the end of 2014. That still leaves a pretty tremendous upside there. And there's other plays in the U.S. that are still moving toward more pad, more horizontal drilling. So I think just the nature of the transition of the market, the new technologies that not only Halliburton and the other service companies have, but the rig contractors are investing more in efficiency. So I don't really see an end to it at this point in time, but I think your big low hanging fruit's been picked at this point.","James West - Barclays Capital","Okay, that's fair. And perhaps an unrelated follow-up on Brazil. I understand that you're negotiating with your major customer there about reducing your investment or your cost structure. What's the timing of when you might have some release on the heavier cost structure than you would have expected given the lack of contract size?","Jeff Miller","James, this estimate is very difficult to call at this point in time. We're working on a range of fronts to try to resolve it, talking with the customer and certainly what could be resolution but certainly not in the first half of the year. We don't expect to see that resolve.","Dave Lesar","Yes, I mean the service industry generally doesn't agree on all things all the time but I can tell you, this is one where both us and our peers are all in having the same discussion with Petrobras. We all really need relief at this point.","James West - Barclays Capital","Sure. Okay, got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. I just want to follow-up on James' questions about efficiency. What are you seeing in terms of efficiency on the pressure pumping side? Where are we in that improvement? It's been \u2013 the number of stages per day has been growing in a 24-hour time period. How do you see that trending in the coming years and where we are in that progress?","Dave Lesar","Waqar, we don't see that outpacing the improvement in drilling efficiently at least at this point in time. So the upshot is there's still more work to be done though we are improving certainly completion efficiency. The other dynamic in completion efficiency though are what we're doing with the completion. So reality is, we're seeing more stages but we're also seeing bigger stages and we're seeing the ability to do more things around the completion. So the concern around the completion outpacing the drilling is not necessarily a concern for us.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just one clarification. I just want to clarify, did you say that the margins in North America are likely to be higher or flat in the first quarter versus fourth quarter?","Dave Lesar","We expect to see those modestly higher\u2026","Mark McCollum","Very modest.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now opened.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thanks. Good morning. With regard to your North America guidance in the first quarter, did I understand the flat prophecy for the quarter? Was that inclusive of an outlook for severe weather in the first quarter or did that exclude the prospect of weather in Q1?","Dave Lesar","Yes, that describe -- we described to you before as high stage count at the beginning of the quarter and then trailed off with the holidays and then a bit of the slow start to some key markets in January due to weather. But what we see is we call out of that is sort of an inverse in Q4. So I call those -- for those reasons about flat.","Mark McCollum","Yes, it is inclusive of weather. It\u2019s just sort of assuming sort of a similar weather pattern to what we had in Q4.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. And then secondly did I hear you correctly Mark with regard to your Latin American margin roadmap for the second half of the year that we hoped to be in the upper teens realm in line with your other international margins by the second half or in the second half?","Mark McCollum","Well, hope it\u2019s a -- yes that\u2019s a strong word.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay.","Mark McCollum","I mean that\u2019s where I hope, but I -- right now I just have no ability to forecast thus getting there right now, given what we know on the revenue side. And the cost side, where we\u2019ve talked -- we\u2019ve described that we\u2019re having to carry a significant amount of cost. We don\u2019t have any relief for that cost right now and so we got to get that relief in order to sort of build the roadmap to get back to those upper teen. So yes, that is our hope that certainly what we\u2019re going to continue to drive internally, but at this -- I don\u2019t have it on our forecast right now just because of the uncertainty around cost recovery.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments.","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Sam. On behalf of Halliburton management team, I just want to thank everyone for your participation. And Sam you can go ahead and close the call.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days.","Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President and CEO; and Chris Weber, CFO.","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and others Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

This was an excellent quarter. Thanks to all the Halliburton employees for their hard work and dedication to superior service quality. Activity improved in all geographic markets in the second quarter. And I\u2019m happy with how Halliburton continues to outperform our major competitors.","I believe that our strategy to collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers will continue to generate industry-leading returns for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.","Now, before we dive into the details, here are a few highlights for the quarter. Total Company revenue was $6.1 billion, representing a 7% increase; and operating income was $789 million, a 27% increase, compared to the first quarter of 2018.","Our Completion & Production division grew operating income by 34% sequentially, primarily driven by the strength of U.S. land. North America had a strong performance this quarter, once again outgrowing the rig count; and U.S. land margins are closing in on the 2014 peak.","During the quarter, we launched our new Sperry ICRUISE rotary steerable in U.S. land, and it looks like a big success. We acquired Athlon Solutions, providing expertise and a manufacturing footprint to develop our reactive chemistry capabilities. And finally, we generated approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow. This is a great step towards generating solid cash flow for the year.","And no doubt about it, this was an excellent quarter. We executed on our plan and delivered strong results. Our overall strategy continues to work and we plan to stay the course. We remain focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance, and providing industry-leading shareholder returns.","As I said in the highlights, U.S. land achieved margins in the second quarter that are closing in on our peak margins from 2014. I want to talk about what that means. Despite pricing levels that had yet to fully rebound from the recent down cycle, we\u2019re achieving outstanding margins. Halliburton executes. We are resilient, adaptive and creative. We\u2019ve been able to outperform by keeping our core competencies strong and delivering superior service quality.","I\u2019m very proud of our North America business. We\u2019re the leading service provider. This is the fastest growing and most dynamic energy market in the world. We have the best people, equipment and technology as well as the closest customer relationships in the North America market. We\u2019ve grown 47% year-over-year in North America, while the rig count has increased 16%, a significant outperformance. At the same time, we believe we\u2019ve achieved close to double the margin of most of our competitors. I believe the strong fundamentals and supportive commodity prices will encourage continued growth in North America.","Fast-growing markets present tremendous opportunities and often temporary challenges. Halliburton is best positioned to take advantage of these opportunities and execute in the face of any challenge. Let\u2019s talk about the challenges of cost inflation, basin dynamics, and pricing, and how we\u2019re addressing it.","With the expected activity in the second half of this year, we are mindful of the impact of cost inflation from trucking and increased maintenance expense. The use of trucking for sand, water and crude oil is generating intense demand for trucks and truck drivers, thus creating cost inflation. We manage trucking costs through the use of containerized sand and integrated logistics helping offset inflation.","Our equipment has never worked harder than it\u2019s working today. Increased pumping time and sand loading continues to cause more wear and tear. Halliburton focuses on reliability and service quality, which requires well-maintained equipment that works as many hours as possible. We have kept our average crew size well below the market average by doing continued maintenance, and that comes with a cost. In this environment of record sand usage, we believe as a result of our predictive diagnostic tools, we are more efficient than our competitors in maintaining our fleet.","Now, with respect to basin dynamics. There is much talk in the industry about off-take capacity. But during the last few weeks, I visited with customers in the Permian and they don\u2019t look like a group that\u2019s backing down. I can see it in their eyes. They feel good about where they are and how they are positioned for the long run. Don\u2019t underestimate this group. They are competitive, will figure out how to deal with constraints and will adapt.","Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am not na\u00efve to the math around that off-take issue. But as we\u2019ve seen so far, our customers will not all react in the same manner. There are customers that have moved their focus from one basin to another, and we\u2019re there pursuing that work. Other customers plan to reduce activity over the short term or adding fewer rigs than expected, and we will find new work to replace them.","Let me put the off-take constraint in the context of what I\u2019ve seen in the past. Tightness is an indicator of a great resource, and what is occurring in the Permian today is not new. We managed similar challenges in the Williston in the last cycle and in the DJ Basin today. The DJ suffered constraints on gas takeaway all year but our customers have managed their businesses and remained productive as have we. This work may not be as efficient as it could have been, but we\u2019ve taken action to maximize our revenue and control our cost. The constraints in this basin should begin to alleviate in early 2019 as additional off-take capacity comes on line. The same will be true in the Permian, which is best suited to handle this type of challenge, and will do so as quickly as possible. In the interim, we are going to keep equipment working, control our costs and outperform our competitors.","The Marcellus is beginning to see some softening in activity as our customers hit their production targets earlier than planned. In some ways, we are a victim of our own success as we develop longer laterals with better production. As a result, we expect this area to have temporary softness in the back half of 2018, but it\u2019s poised to regain activity as the calendar turns to 2019 and additional pipeline capacity is available. We will manage through the year-end and be ready for the increased activity next year.","I expect that these temporary efficiency drags will create headwinds for additional upward pricing in the third quarter. Our competitors\u2019 new and uncontracted equipment is also creating pricing pressure in some areas. We will continue our efforts to optimize pricing and utilization, pursue continued technology implementation and control cost to maintain our industry-leading returns. For example, the continued implementation of our ExpressKinect system, containerized sand, and new Sperry tools will help improve our efficiency and returns.","Look, I could take some actions that would allow us to achieve our margin goals today. But I believe that would sacrifice our market position and impair our long-term value. We do not manage the business to achieve short-term expectations. We manage the business around long-term strategic goals. We will stay focused on our strategy, maintain our market share, and not sacrifice either to achieve our margin goals in the near term.","We\u2019ve built market share during the downturn on our strong belief in the long-term potential of the North America market. We are returns focused Company. To deliver returns, market share and scale matter. We intent to maintain this expanded market position as our scale delivers outsized operating income, cash flow and returns.","I\u2019m excited about the growth and activity we expect next year, and we are best positioned to maximize our growth and returns. We have the largest revenue base, among the highest margins in North America, the best customers, the best technology, and the best people. Why risk our position when we are working towards a stronger market in 2019? In the meantime, we plan to protect our market share, maximize our cash flow, and achieve the best margins in the industry.","Shifting to technology. Part of what keeps Halliburton outperforming is our implementation of improved technology. This quarter, we introduced our ICRUISE rotary steerable technology in the U.S. land market, and our customer feedback has been extremely positive. We deployed ICRUISE in two major U.S. basins, proving its drilling speeds and complex geosteering capabilities. The wells were successfully drilled while remaining entirely in the payzone of the reservoir. We will continue to deploy this technology globally over the coming months. And I want to thank our design, manufacturing and operations teams for their hard work and dedication to this rollout.","We\u2019ve been clear about our desire to grow our artificial lift and production chemicals capabilities to better position us for the future. Now, this month marks a year since we brought Summit. In that time, we\u2019d expanded our market share and started delivering this product offering into the international markets. We\u2019d experienced exceptional growth, growing at 3 times the rate of the U.S. land rig count, while executing our integration plan, we remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead. The customer feedback is positive and we are well-positioned to grow this business into a global market leader.","In the second quarter, we entered the reactive chemistry space through the acquisition of Athlon Solutions. Athlon is a manufacturer of chemicals for the upstream oil and gas industry, and is a leading provider of specialty water and process treatment chemicals. This acquisition provides expertise in reactive chemistries and facilities. We expect Athlon will enhance growth and profitability in our Multi-Chem product service line and across our chemistry portfolio. This acquisition is the first step in developing our reactive chemistry capability in North America and complements our ongoing efforts to manufacture chemicals in international markets.","We had a plan to grow artificial lift in production chemicals, and we\u2019re executing our plan. However, this will have a short-term impact on our C&P margins. I want to thank all of the employees that are making this happen and welcome the new Athlon employees to our team. Without our employees\u2019 hard work and dedication, these acquisitions would not be successful. I\u2019m excited about these added capabilities and look forward to their future growth and contribution.","Now, turning to the international markets. I believe that the international markets will continue to steadily improve over the coming quarters. Halliburton doesn\u2019t always get the credit it should for our international business, but it is strong. And we consistently execute to manage the changing market dynamics.","I\u2019m excited about where we are in the international markets. Halliburton is better positioned than ever, and we are ready to make the most of it. We\u2019re in every market. We made the investment last cycle. We have the technology. We grew the breadth and depth of our portfolio. As an example, in the last cycle, we only competed in part of the wireline market. Today, we offer technology that goes head-to-head with the competition, in every geography. We\u2019ve strengthened relationships. We\u2019re collaborating with customers to maximize their asset value. Our value proposition is resonating. We are present, and we we\u2019re winning. You must be present to win in the international business.","There is no doubt, the pricing environment and the international markets has been challenging. We saw a large number of tenders in the first half of the year. These tenders were competitively bid as service companies buy for market share, and our customers sought to capture pricing at the bottom of the cycle. In many countries, large tenders set a baseline for activity for the industry, which will cover basic in-country overhead and should allow any incremental activity to be bid with healthier pricing.","As we look ahead, we see emerging conditions that should enable leading-edge pricing to improve next year. Growth in geographies like the North Sea and volume increases in the Middle East should create an inflection point, at least to improve overall pricing in 2019. How much improvement and how quickly it comes, will depend in large part upon commodity prices and equipment absorption.","Two great examples of our success in the international markets are recent contract wins in unconventionals in Saudi Arabia and offshore Norway. Both of these locations present technical challenges and we\u2019re meeting those channels.","We\u2019re bringing our industry-leading technology to help develop unconventional plays in the Kingdom. I believe this work represents the largest unconventional completion contract ever awarded in the Middle East. This is a great opportunity to provide a customized application of Halliburton\u2019s technology, logistics management, and operational excellence to maximize asset value and deliver optimal recovery. This opportunity places Halliburton at the forefront for expansion in unconventional activity in the Middle East.","In Norway, we improved our market share through collaborating in engineering solutions with our customers. The North Sea is in the midst of recovery, and additional activity is starting to reduce excess capacity. The contract wins we\u2019ve seen in this region are due to our technology development, service quality, and willingness to collaborate with our customers. This is a market where our improved wireline and Sperry technology have been most effective. Acceptance of our new technology is positive. And we plan to build on this activity to improve price and efficiency, thus improving margins.","I recently returned from a trip to Latin America. This region is continuing to fight to reduced activity levels and pricing pressure. Our employees remain focused on winning work and delivering superior service quality. Our bright spot in the region is Argentina. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in unconventionals in that country. Basin infrastructure is slowly improving and we have a strong customer base that is collaborating, investing and doing what is required to make the market work. Working with our customers, we see the opportunities that will help us reach the efficiencies necessary to make unconventional plays even more successful. We believe in our customers in this region and will implement our industry-leading technology to reduce cost per barrel of oil equivalent.","Moving to our long-term view of the international markets. We will continue to increase our business in the industry\u2019s highest growth markets, including mature fields and unconventional resources, and optimize our Company\u2019s growth and returns. We expect an improvement in our international operations in 2019 as new contracts start up, leading-edge pricing improves, and new technologies are introduced.","Looking to the third quarter, I expect our earnings will be similar to what we delivered in the second quarter due to the temporary issues facing North America. That\u2019s a great outcome. I like where we are and it will serve as an excellent bridge to a strong 2019. The temporary challenges will soon abate. And I believe global supply and demand dynamics will support continued industry growth, which I expect will accelerate in 2019. Halliburton is best positioned to outperform in the short term and to capitalize on a period of prolonged future growth for the industry.","Now, I will turn the call over to Chris for a financial update.","Chris Weber","Thanks, Jeff.","I will start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $6.1 billion and operating income was $789 million, representing increases of 7% and 27%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in U.S. land.","Looking at our division results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue increased by 9% while operating income increased 34%, and operating margin increased by nearly 300 basis points. These results were primarily driven by increased pressure pumping and artificial lift activity in the United States land sector as well as increased pressure pumping services in Europe, Africa and CIS. These increases were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in Europe, Africa and CIS, and reduced pressure pumping services in the Middle East.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 3% while operating income increased 2% and operating margin was roughly flat. These results were primarily due to increased drilling activity in United States land sector, as well as increased drilling services and project management activity in the Middle East and India. These increases were partially offset by reduced drilling fluid activity in the Gulf of Mexico.","In North America, revenue increased by 9%. This improvement was led by increased activity throughout the United States land sector within the majority of Halliburton\u2019s product service lines, primarily pressure pumping, as well as higher drilling and artificial lift activity. Partially offsetting these increases were lower pressure pumping activity in Canada and reduced drilling fluid activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America Revenue grew by 5%, resulting primarily from increases in software sales and project management activity in Mexico as well as stimulation activity in Argentina.","Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, revenue was slightly improved. These results were primarily driven by higher pressure pumping and pipeline services throughout the region, offset by lower completion tool sales, primarily in the North Sea and Angola along with reduced drilling activity in Azerbaijan.","In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased 6%. This increase was largely the result of increased drilling services, project management activity, and completion tool sales in the Middle East as well as increased project management activity in India. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $71 million, in line with our guidance. Next quarter, we expect to see a slight increase to about $75 million, primarily due to the implementation of cost saving projects.","Net interest expense was $137 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. We expect to continue around this run-rate in the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 20%, which was lower than anticipated due to discrete tax benefits. Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 20%.","Turning to cash flow. We ended the quarter with a total cash position of $2.5 billion, inclusive of marketable securities. Cash from operations during the quarter was approximately $1 billion, driven by higher business activity and working capital improvement. Capital expenditures were $565 million and our full year 2018 CapEx remained unchanged.","Going forward, we expect to generate strong free cash flow and still plan to retire the $400 million note that matures in August. In addition, in the second half of this year, we are targeting to both retire our $500 million 2021 debt maturity as well as initiate share repurchases under our existing authorized program.","Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Chris.","To summarize, despite the temporary challenges affecting North America, I believe we are in the beginning of a prolonged cycle to continue to expand our revenues and improve our margins. The international markets continue to see pricing pressure, but we are seeing signs that pricing is stabilizing. We\u2019re experiencing the positive impact of incremental activity on margins. We believe that the second half of 2018 will be better for our international markets. And contract wins in key segments are providing us the foundation to expand international margins in 2019.","We will generate strong free cash flow through the balance of the year and look forward to reducing debt levels and initiating buybacks. Halliburton is the best positioned for this market. Our value proposition resonates with our customers. And we will continue to maximize their asset value while providing industry-leading returns for our shareholders.","Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","James West","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, James.","James West","So, Jeff, I want to make sure I get your guidance correct here, specifically with regards to North America. So, clearly, it\u2019s temporary, but we\u2019re going to see some weakness. The Marcellus, I think, is one that\u2019s a little bit new to at least myself. We obviously understand the issues in the Permian. But, I guess, are you suggesting that revenue comes down in the second half and there\u2019s a commensurate impact on the margin profile in North America, in the second half? And then at some point, in -- obviously, in \u201819, we\u2019re going to see again a short squeeze and a pick-up in activity pretty significant. But, is that kind of the profile you\u2019re thinking about over the next several quarters?","Jeff Miller","Yes, James. Look, when I talk about flat earnings that does not mean flat revenues. We see revenues up in North America and quite frankly internationally, and expect to outgrow the rig count in both. From an earnings perspective, let me say this, internationally, we face the same issues as our competitors. In North America, quite frankly, no one knows it better than we do. And I\u2019ve already mentioned a lot of those challenges in my remarks. So, the bottom line is, I think that headwinds and the tailwinds are about the same, but very positive in terms of outlook as we look at 2019.","James West","Okay. Fair enough. And then, on the international side, there is a little bit of pricing starting to at least tighten as we go into 2019. Are you already having these discussions with the customer base at this point, and do you see your utilization of equipment, basically getting to that trigger point where you have to raise pricing in order to justify CapEx investments before year-end?","Jeff Miller","Well, James, clearly having those discussions with clients, we are seeing the ramp up in activity internationally, and seeing some tightness in certain product lines. For example, we bumped up CapEx last quarter at Sperry and anticipate rolling out technology, and what we see is that runway. But, we\u2019re coming off of a tough bottom here. So discussions don\u2019t necessarily mean price increases, certainly not immediate.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jud Bailey","Jeff, I wanted to narrow that down on the North America margin kind of topic. You cited several things that\u2019ll probably impact things in the back half of the year. Pricing in some areas little bit of risk, new mix chemical is now in there, uncertainty in a couple of basins. How should we think about -- you can frame it as C&P or just North America margins, do margins flat to down in the third quarter or up? And then, how do we think about them in the back half of the year? And what are going to be the main moving pieces that will impact profitability in North America over the next couple of quarters in your mind?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think, look, maybe I\u2019ll just take a minute on the second half or this quarter and look ahead. I mean this was a fantastic quarter and delivered the highest revenue, highest margins and best returns. But, I did talk about customer dislocation in the northeast to a degree as they\u2019ve met their production goals, and at least likely moderation or perception of moderation in the Permian Basin. But, I do know with certainty that 2019 is going to be humming. I mean, we\u2019re looking at demand that\u2019s already on the books. And I know this business. And so, whenever equipment moves around or we see any kind of slack in the system at all, I know the maintenance goes up, cost. And I\u2019ve told our people to take advantage of that and spend more but be ready for 2019, which realistically translates into about $0.04 incremental impact on Q3. And that additional $0.04 is already baked into the guidance that I gave you. So, I don\u2019t know, if that gives you a little more color. I mean, this is great market and great business.","Jud Bailey","Okay. So, should -- I mean to just to circle back on that, do we think margins can hold firm or they deteriorate a little bit due to all -- some of these issues we\u2019re talking about in the third quarter?","Jeff Miller","Look, I think in the third quarter, because of the things I\u2019ve talked about, there may be some softening, but we\u2019re going to be still at or well above kind of where the rest of market is.","Jud Bailey","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, maybe if you could talk a little bit more detail perhaps about Athlon, the acquisition during the quarter, you touched on in your prepared comments. Maybe you could give us a little bit more detail on how you view that business and how it\u2019s going to impact North America business moving forward?","Jeff Miller","Look, really excited about the Athlon acquisition. And it\u2019s part of a strategy that we\u2019ve had in place to grow our chemicals business. It\u2019s a small acquisition, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that I\u2019d like to do because it gives us all of the platform to grow at organically from here, and it complements some things we\u2019re doing internationally. Over time, it\u2019s going to deliver terrific returns. We are early in that cycle having just closed. But, the approach that we take on these kind of acquisitions, really works. This is an example where we buy a plant that\u2019s sort of moderately utilized. We\u2019ve got internal utilization that will actually ramp it up to a high rate of efficiency and lower our costs. So over time, that\u2019s going to be a very good acquisition and part of our strategy around chemicals.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.","Angie Sedita","So, Jeff, just to dig into a little bit further, the comments on the Permian and the customer behavior, some are moving forward and very active and then some you\u2019re saying are reducing activity or adding fewer than expected rigs. And then, maybe you could give a little bit more color on the mix as far as the number of customers that are starting to see some slowing of activity? And then, also your comments on the pricing pressure in some areas, just a little more color there would be great.","Jeff Miller","Okay. Thanks, Angie. But look, Permian off-take has nominal impact today. But, as I described, it\u2019s not na\u00efve to the math. I mean, clearly, this is the world class resource. And the entrepreneurs in that market will get it solved, I mean never bet against them. But in the near term, I think perception has as much impact as anything. And by that, I mean weighs on customer urgency, which ultimately has an impact on our utilization and efficiency. But look, no doubt this is world class resource. As far as more color, not much more to give other than a couple of very small but leading, and I would say, nominal factors at this point with respect to off-take.","Angie Sedita","Okay. So, as I think about 2019 and obviously you\u2019re positive on the outlook for 2019, but if we put in the context of pricing is flattish, I think you\u2019ve done a very good job in the past. And correct me if I am wrong that the biggest driver of your margins are efficiency gains, not pricing. So, thoughts on the ability to drive margins in 2019 and maybe potentially a flat market environment for pricing?","Jeff Miller","Look, Angie, we\u2019re very confident in the levers that we have and excited about how those continued to get rolled out, and I described some of them in the call. But I think what\u2019s important is along the way as we get the \u201819 and beyond, I want to deliver the highest North American revenues and the best returns in North America. So, we\u2019re going to take whatever the market gives us and get an outsized share of that. Also along the way, we delivered terrific free cash flow. And so, I believe Halliburton is where you want to be. And I think those other levers, in fact I know those other levers well in place, moving to \u201819.","Chris Weber","Yes. I mean, you look at \u201819, and Jeff talked about demand on the books starting in early next year. We would expect that to positively impact utilization and positively impact pricing.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Sean Meakim","So, Jeff, maybe just to clarify little further on frac. Leading edge in the Permian, can you give us a sense of where your folks in the field see pricing heading and how you think that could eventually flow through into your fleets over the next couple of quarters?","Jeff Miller","Look, Sean, I\u2019ll be crazy to talk about pricing strategy on this call. I mean, this is not a place where we\u2019ll discuss that. I know that our competitors, all of our competitors, probably most of our customers are listening. But, what we\u2019re committed to do is what\u2019s best for both our customers and our shareholders.","Sean Meakim","Okay. Fair enough. So, internationally, it sounds like you\u2019re going to feel some impact of the startup cost in some of these projects, similar to what you\u2019ve heard from your peers. Is that a fair characterization? And as we look towards 2019, would you say that there is going to be opportunities for increased growth capital, internationally?","Jeff Miller","Yes, I think there will be in 2019. I\u2019m very, very excited about what we\u2019re seeing unfold internationally. And we\u2019ll see some of that in the second half of 2018 with respect to increase in activity. There will be some mobilization around that. But, as we look out to 2019 and really beyond, yes. I mean, I see a solid demand set coming together in front of us. And I\u2019ve been I think pretty clear on international outlook over this last cycle and believe we\u2019re right now. And as we see that grow into 2019, we\u2019ll need some capital, but it\u2019s probably, as we get into the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.","Bill Herbert","Hey. Good morning, guys. So, I just want to discuss a little bit with regards to the timing of the proceeds, kind of recovery if that\u2019s the right word for the Permian with regard to the resolution, these takeaway capacity issues. Totally agree that these are transient, but most of the incremental capacity comes on second half of \u201819. We\u2019ve got an exceptionally tight labor market in the Permian, the whole value chain is super tight. This could actually get pushed out by a little bit. So, I\u2019m just curious, in light of the fact that this could be a multi-quarter stagnation, if you will, with regard to Permian, call it four quarters, maybe a bit more, who in the heck knows, yet we\u2019re maintaining the capital spending budget, Chris at $2 billion for this year. Walk us through that.","Chris Weber","From that capital budget perspective, we planned or set, and we\u2019ve got a good view with regards to what we\u2019re putting into Sperry and what we\u2019re doing. So, it\u2019s allowed us about positioning for \u201819 but and a lot of that capital is focused towards international, not necessarily just North America. So, we feel like it\u2019s still in the right place.","Jeff Miller","I guess, I\u2019ll follow that up as well, Bill. I\u2019ll go back to the ability to react very quickly, to capital requirements in North America. So, unlike our competitors, there are no orders that we placed a year ago that are being delivered today. We can move as quickly as 30 days, if required to move in 30 days. So, we continue to look for leading edge, pricing returns, and we have a really great business development organization. So, we know how to get things placed quickly and don\u2019t pull the capital lever until all of those conditions are right.","Bill Herbert","Okay. So, in the event that this is a little bit slower for longer than anticipated, and the deployment of incremental horsepower slows down?","Jeff Miller","Yes. ","Bill Herbert","Okay. Got it. And then, the second question for me is switching gears to international. At this stage, it just seems like rest of the world oil prices ex-Permian, if you will, look to be pretty constructive with regard to supply and demand fundamentals, based upon a myriad of different factors that we all know about. So, in light of the visibility improving for international, do you think at this juncture, the expectation for a double-digit increase in revenues for 2019 is realistic, and ditto for D&E, as a result of that formulation?","Jeff Miller","Realistic is the short answer. I mean, all of the things that we sort of thought would unfold around supply are unfolding. And declines because of underinvestment are starting to manifest. And that sets us for a terrific sort of long-term ramp internationally. And feel like, even in the Permian, as we described that that\u2019s a moderation in growth as opposed to a pullback.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jim Wicklund","Good morning, guys. Jeff, you have laid out the long-term -- the longer term issues very well. There is no question that that the Permian is a world class asset and will -- supposed to be 60% of global oil growth for the next three to five years. But, what this does do is it -- is sets it back a couple of quarters. Investors often care more about the short-term than the longer term and your sock is down 7% on the open on this morning. And so, the real question is, how long does it take you to get back to where we expected Q3 to be in your internal planning? And I\u2019m not going to -- I don\u2019t want to belabor earnings or anything, but you just got it down $0.10 for Q3, and that obviously means we\u2019re going to have some got down in Q4. In your planning, when do we get back on track to where Q3 was expected to be? Is this a two-quarter event, a three-quarter event, or fourth-quarter event? And while I -- I know we don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just talking about your expectation of the market today. When do we get back on track? The market\u2019s at discounting mechanism, we\u2019re now discounting different -- six months ahead. So, it\u2019s kind of like when do we get back on track? I have no question of long-term trajectory but how long does this garden leave this pause actually last?","Jeff Miller","Well, Jim, I think we see -- I will go back to the perspective on what we saw the Williston recover; we\u2019ve seen the DJ Basin is in the midst of takeaway capacity, and that\u2019s being resolved. And I would bet on the sooner rather than later in terms of West Texas. But, I expect that we do in the meantime is make a lot of free cash flow between now and when that\u2019s resolved and expect that it happens -- while I say sooner rather than later, there are probably lots of things that can be done to improve that as they work through 2019, but it\u2019s certainly within the confines of 2019.","Jim Wicklund","Okay, within the confines of 2019 helps a lot. And you\u2019ve had a higher debt-to-cap ratio following the paycheck to Baker, running about 50%. You talked about how you\u2019re going to pay off your $500 million and your $400 million this year, and then look at buying back stock. What\u2019s the current goal or objective on a debt-to-cap ratio or an EBITDA ratio, however you want to do it? Where do you need to get the balance sheet to go before you start getting more aggressive in stock buybacks with all the free cash flow generation?","Chris Weber","So, we\u2019ve talked about target credit metrics, debt-to-EBITDA under 2.5 times and comfortable on that. Debt-to-cap, as you mentioned is still low 50s. We want that to be down in the 30. So, some work to do there. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress on debt repayment, $1.5 billion in 2017, targeting about another $1 billion in second half of this year. That\u2019s 2.5 billion in total over two years, and that\u2019s put a meaningful impact on credit metrics. But, we still have some work to do. And we\u2019ll be thoughtful about looking for opportunities to do that going forward, as we think about how to deploy excess cash. But, consistent with what we said before, we\u2019re not going to look to pay big premiums to retire debt. We will be thoughtful and efficient about how we do it, but again, balancing that with growth, things like the Athlon acquisition and return of cash to shareholders.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Anderson","You talked about having seeing some of these efficiency drags in the past, not the first you\u2019ve seen some of efficiencies creep up. I was hoping you could talk about kind of how this cycle compares to last cycle, particularly with E&P trends. So, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot of about these four-well pads being the preferred size, some of them being drilled simultaneously here in bigger pads. So, I am just curious, as the operations start to scale up, I would think this really increases your visibility into customer activity quite a bit more, particularly with DUC inventories. Can you talk about how that potentially can help you during issues like this and whether or not that can actually ultimately lift your margins going forward, this increased visibility you have? Because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever had visibility like this in the past on your customers.","Jeff Miller","No. I mean, these -- thank you, David. These are bigger capital expenditures than what you typically see in unconventionals but it also increases utilization and your better utilization throughout the day. It also allows us to better organize work. And because of the size of these, yes, there is more visibility of them sort of as the say manifest out in front of us. I also think though, it\u2019s a demonstration of just the market moving towards better returns, in general. So, it\u2019s as our customers look for ways to produce more and more quickly and try to give returns sooner in the cycle on the types of capital investments required for these larger pads.","David Anderson","On the completely different subject. On your international commentary, you\u2019ve talked about competitors aggressively taking up some of these lower price tenders out there. You talked somewhat positively about pricing going forward. I got this sense in your commentary that capacity is tightened up now to the point internationally that you feel better about the pricings on contract going forward or is there something with the mix of the contracts that are coming out that suggest the pricing or margins for bidders could be better.","Jeff Miller","Couple of things there. So, first, we are seeing some tightening in certain markets. And I think, it\u2019s got going to be -- sort of international is a really big place. We can\u2019t paint it with only one brush. As I described North Sea, seeing some tightness there, we\u2019ll see some tightness in markets as we move around. And as a baseline of work is tendered, the follow-on work after that quite frankly is where there is more opportunity from a pricing standpoint or bidding, tendering standpoint to do things around price. And I expect that will unfold as we work into \u201819. But the base level of business is always very competitive, and that\u2019s where a lot of efficiencies and work is done to improve those. But, so, my comment around tightness is, I think I\u2019m seeing some tightness in certain service lines, as I described billing tools, which I think will drive some tightness. But, it\u2019s more -- it will come in sort of geographies. Now, unfortunately, we\u2019re seeing this across a number of geographies in terms of an uptick. But as far as that tightness goes, that will be sort of one at a time, I expect.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Scott Gruber","Jeff, I want to circle back to Bill\u2019s line of inquiry and international growth potential, double-digit potential next year, which is great to hear. What\u2019s your view on how the international cycle evolves, not just over the next 12 months, but let\u2019s look out over the next three years. What I\u2019m curious about are, are we going to see a genuine deepwater recovery, are we going to see a genuine exploration cycle? And what I mean by genuine is not just a bounce off the bottom, which given the decline we\u2019ve seen, 10% would really be just that, just the bounce off the bottom. Are we setting the stage here for multiple years of double-digit growth on international side and within deepwater?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Deepwater, as I\u2019ve always said is sort of the last to come back into the frame. And I think deepwater still is push to the right as far as widespread recovery. But, the macro that we see shaping up is certainly encouraging, but the kind of deepwater, new AFE type activity I expect is going to require confidence in what is the long term outlook on the forward-look on oil, which I think is improving and is reaching a point that it\u2019s supportive. So, as we look out a couple of years, I think that\u2019s where we see inside of that three-year window, as you described it, as we see deepwater pick up, probably in a more meaningful way. And exploration, again, the exploration that we\u2019re seeing so far has been certainly more focused around sort of step outs and things that are near to existing infrastructure, generally speaking. And I think more confidence, a, in cash flows and by our clients. And again, speculating here, but I would expect that as confidence builds, so will that.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And an unrelated follow-up here. What\u2019s your view on the market penetration potential of electric frac fleets? Is this a technology that can move beyond a niche application? And where do you stand on the development of a fully electric frac offering?","Jeff Miller","Well, we look at everything through the lens of returns, and that hasn\u2019t changed. So, we\u2019ve certainly done some work around electric frac fleets and have tested that process and how -- and what we think about it. Not convinced today that -- well, I shouldn\u2019t say that, but we need to see that unfold and see what are the real return capabilities of that, mean the physics say, it still has to generate energy. We have to move big things around. So, I\u2019m not as convinced that we see the type of return around the cost of that, it\u2019s probably a 2X cost of getting into that electric sort of power generation versus what we\u2019re able to accomplish today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead","So, hey, Jeff, great color, commentary so far. So, something to maybe explore a little bit more on the fact that you talked about, you have demand on the books going out into 2019. It sounds like that is very much geared toward the international market. I just want to get some clarity that is it mostly international or does it also include some Permian. And in your mind is this tend to be a little bit earlier than usual and all your customers, especially on the international front getting some sense of urgency to get moving?","Jeff Miller","No. That\u2019s more -- I mean, that comment is a North America comment in terms of activity that we see in 2019. Certainly, in markets where -- really across the piece, there is demand. We still have inbound demand in a market like this. So, I\u2019m describing efficiency, the challenges to utilization efficiency through the second half of the year. But, that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t see inbound demand today. And we also see very strong demand as we go into 2019. That\u2019s the North America comment. As I talked about international, again, we see a contract set that we won today. And we also have visibility of, sort of, as I described last quarter, the doubling of tender activity. That\u2019s all going to manifest over the second half of this year. And so, I\u2019d make the same comment internationally. I mean, just like I say, this is a great outlook and a great market.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. And then, you referenced the fact that U.S. land margins were approaching that peak level in 2014. I know that in prior comments target\u2019s been put out there, about 20% -- reaching 20% by the end of 2018. Given your most recent comments about some elements of slowdown or increased maintenance CapEx, do you still think it\u2019s feasible to get to the 20% margin by the end of the year?","Jeff Miller","Look, what we are doing is making decisions around longer term. And it\u2019s critical that we deliver leading returns and most free cash flow that we can deliver, we\u2019re going to lead the market in doing those things. And so, the kind of decision we could have made -- getting to the target could have happened last quarter, this quarter or next quarter. But, those decisions would be shortsighted, in my view, not right for the business. So, as I said, what hasn\u2019t changed is Halliburton does have largest revenues, highest margins, best returns. And so, we\u2019re going to do those things to capture as much of 2019 as you expect and probably more. All of these things, as I\u2019ve said solve themselves as we go into 2019, and I\u2019m really excited about next year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Waqar Syed","Good morning. My question relates to pressure pumping capacity. I think, in the past you\u2019ve said that the market may still be undersupplied by about 0.5 million hydraulic horsepower. What\u2019s your current thinking and where do you think in the second half, based on what capacity additions are coming in, what the supply demand balance looks like?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, Waqar. I mean, because of the things I\u2019ve described this morning, I mean, I think the total market is temporarily balanced. And I know our equipment is sold out and we could sell more. And that\u2019s because of there\u2019s a lot of demand for what Halliburton does from a service quality standpoint, reliability, efficiency and technology. And the demand or the pressure, the work rolled on the equipment hasn\u2019t changed, and that\u2019s the -- so, it means that the attrition story hasn\u2019t changed either. And we still see probably half of the incremental horsepower that comes into the market being ploughed back into existing fleets, and that\u2019s reason I spend so much time and we spend so much time managing fleet size. And we have fleet sizes that are well below the industry average and that\u2019s how we -- one of the ways that we deliver leading returns.","Waqar Syed","Okay. And just a follow-up on that. We had about decoupling pumping services from fracs and supply. Are you seeing the same trends and how would that impact margins for you guys and then are you going to change any strategy as a result of that changing trend?","Jeff Miller","I mean, with respect sand, the de-bundling, that\u2019s a mixed bag. Ultimately, customers hire Halliburton to pump sand downhole, that\u2019s what we get paid for. And we make money off a range of business models today and will continue to make margins off of making better wells. So, I don\u2019t see a change in our strategy there. But, obviously, we look at everything through a returns lens and whatever that best returning model is, is how we view that.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Candice. Before we close, I would like to wrap up with a few key points. First, I believe we are in the beginning of a prolonged upcycle in both North America and the international markets, and Halliburton is best positioned to grow and expand margins. Second, we expect to generate strong free cash flow and plan to reduce our outstanding debt levels, and are targeting to initiate share repurchases. Finally, our value proposition resonates with our customers and delivers industry-leading returns to our shareholders. So, I\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Candice, please close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President and CEO and Chris Weber, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events.

We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.","After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. As it played out, it was a challenging quarter for the services industry in North America. We didn\u2019t see the typical growth we expect in pressure pumping activity in the third quarter. This negatively impacted pricing and the efficient use of our equipment as customers responded to budget limitations and off-take capacity bottlenecks.","As said, I am pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter. Our team optimized our performance in North America in the face of short term market challenges and the recovery of our international operations continue.","Let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue was $6.2 billion essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, while operating income was $716 million a 9% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2018, largely due to the softening North American market.","We converted nearly a 110% of operating income into operating cash flow, generating approximately $780 million during the third quarter with over $2.3 billion generated on a year-to-date basis.","We continue to deliver the highest returns in the industry this quarter. Now I\u2019m pleased with our international business, which is showing signs of a steady recovery. Our international revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter with growth in every international region.","As expected, North America revenue declined as a result of market softness, but we believe we still have the highest margins. Relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance, while our completions related activity remained relatively flat sequentially; we believe we outperformed the market based on available market data. This demonstrates the customer\u2019s flight to quality and positions us well as the market dynamics improve.","And finally, we continue our long term focus on delivering shareholder returns. During the third quarter, we returned over $350 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Despite the near term temporary challenges, which I will address in a minute the macro outlook for the oil and gas industry is the strongest it has been in four years. The combination of economic growth, affordable fuel prices and demand for petro chemicals sets the stage for continued positive trends.","The focal point of the discussion during this current recovery has mostly been the supply side of the equation. The fact is we have more clarity today regarding the sources of supply and their limitation. Temporary issues affecting North America production, the spare capacity limitations in the Middle East and Russia and significant under investment in non-OPEC, non-U.S. supply are reflected in today\u2019s strong commodity prices.","Simply put, current commodity prices incentivize our global customer base to start unlocking more of their assets, and that\u2019s a good thing for Halliburton. We see it in the increased number of final investment decisions announced by our customers and the projected rig count growth.","Now turning to near term operations, in North America the market for completion services softened during the third quarter, impacting service company activity and pricing and Halliburton was not an exception. The combination off-take capacity constraints and our customers exhausting their budgets led to less demand for completion services than expected.","Halliburton\u2019s response was to retain our customers who demonstrate the best efficiency to manage cost, to move equipment to more active operators, to retain our people, to perform additional maintenance and to continue investing in technology.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, current feedback from our customers indicates that budget exhaustion and seasonal issues will predictably impact activity. We think operators will take extended breaks. Some even starting before thanksgiving. Therefore we expect customer activity levels to decrease in the last six weeks of the year.","We will do what a rational business would do in this situation. We will work to keep our equipment utilized in the short term when it makes business sense to do so, and we will take steps to position ourselves for a better 2019.","You know me and you know our management team. We understand the North America market better than anyone. We were the first to call out these challenges as we came out of the second quarter. I believe that these headwinds are temporary, and I\u2019ll draw on the arsenal of measures available to me to manage through this brief dislocation in the North America market.","Moving on from the fourth quarter, I\u2019m excited about 2019. The catalysts are there for a strong activity rebound. These catalysts are, customer budget should reload with higher-priced decks and stronger hedge positions improving operator\u2019s free cash flow and creating additional spending power. The rising DUC count will provide a substantial completions backlog ready to be worked down in 2019.","Off-take capacity will expand. Our industry is adaptive and creative. This manifests itself yet again and the announced conversion of pipelines in the Permian basin and new processing capacity in the Marcellus.","We believe that the market will get better in the first quarter of 2019 and sets up for continued momentum throughout the year. We believe that the fourth quarter of 2018 will be the bottom in North America land.","I believe this, because I see it. I\u2019m already seeing demand from our customers for 2019. They\u2019re eager to get back to work. I hear it. I\u2019m hearing this from our business development organization who are busy responding to inbound 2019 demand. I feel it. I\u2019m feeling customer urgency come back as operators want reassurance. Our crews will be back out working for them when budgets reset and they restart their full completions programs.","Increased activity leads to higher pricing. Once the catalysts I just described materialize, customer urgency will increase and that will help improve pricing. The quality of our technology and services allows us to play at the higher end of the price range, meaning we\u2019re the first to benefit from price recovery.","There are obviously a number of moving parts in North America and the slope of the ramp up in activity will be different in every basin. I continue to believe that all the temporary challenges we face are signs of a great resource, a resource that shifted the world supply and demand dynamics in the last five years. Our customers are resilient and creative. They are addressing these challenges head-on with the grit and determination we\u2019ve come to expect from North America operators.","So let me walk you around the various basins in the U.S. In the Northeast, our customers have already met their 2018 production targets. They slowed down activity and they\u2019re now expanding their processing facilities. Natural gas prices have recently surpassed $3 per MCF and are forecasted to stay there throughout the winter.","Pipelines are coming online and starting to move gas out of the Northeast and into more premium priced markets that will lower differentials and improve economics, allowing our customers in the Northeast to do more with their budgets next year.","Similarly in the DJ basin, operators are waiting for additional pipeline capacity, primarily the DCP pipeline to help with differentials, while our DJ customers have significantly slowed down completions activity at the moment we believe that new pipelines arriving in 2019 will spur them into action again. The story of the ongoing effort to increase Permian off-take capacity has been well covered. Our customers there have responded differently to take away constraints, some still have firm take away capacity, and we continue completing wells for them. Others have options in other basins and have shifted focus elsewhere, and then there are those who don\u2019t have take away capacity and don\u2019t have options in other basins and they are deferring completions.","In the Eagle Ford, we\u2019re seeing operators who been highly efficient throughout the year, cutting back activity as a result of deflated budgets. In the Midcon and Rockies, operators are staying within their cash flow obligations for the year, however, our customers in all these basins are preparing to start 2019 afresh on a higher note.","Halliburton works in every unconventional basin in the U.S. and were the best positioned to understand the market dynamics and take advantage of the expected activity improvement in 2019, wherever it may come first.","In the meantime, we are watching the same external data points that you do. Commodity pricing will remain an important factor; with WTI around $70 the appetite to grow production will be much higher. The DUC count in North America is the highest it\u2019s ever been, if our customer start working DUC down as early as mid-January, Halliburton will be a great beneficiary.","Our customers are entering budgeting season. Their 2019 spending plans will greatly depend on where commodity prices are at the end of the year, what hedges are available for purchase, and when their current hedges roll-off, the combination of positive outcomes for all of the above would bode well for substantial increases in 2019 budgets.","We know how to manage your business and will keep adjusting our cost structure to market conditions, but it does not make sense for us to dramatically reduce costs or infrastructure for what we see is a temporary slowdown in activity levels. We are using this time to improve the health of our fleet, to position our North America land business for future success and outperformance as the market improves.","Internationally, I believe the markets are in the early stages of recovery. Modest improvement in activity continues, but competitive pressures remain. Nevertheless, I\u2019m pleased with where our international business is today and think that Halliburton has a strong foundation for international growth in this cycle.","We collaborate with our customers to improve their project economics and our profitability through advanced technology and increased operating efficiency. This international recovery as I see it has two distinct attributes; first, it starts with mature fields. In today\u2019s environment, customers broadly favor shorter cycle returns and lower risk projects. That manifests itself in the form of development focused, production oriented strategies, both onshore and offshore.","The active markets in the North Sea in the Middle East attested that. Second, this recovery will see national oil companies take the lead; many of them have government mandates to grow production and work hard to revitalize your mature asset base, develop unconventional resources for internal consumption and search for partners to fund offshore exploration.","I believe both of these attributes play in Halliburton\u2019s favor. We\u2019re traditionally strong in completion and production technologies that are key to mature fields development. National oil companies look for a collaborative approach to tackling their various challenges, and collaboration is in our DNA.","We go to work every day to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Our international business is a more valuable asset to Halliburton shareholders today than it was even three years ago. We\u2019ve had an international presence since 1926 and we currently operate in over 80 countries.","During the last cycle, we made significant investments in our international footprint, including increasing our product service line footprint in various geographies, expanding our manufacturing capacity in Singapore and opening technology centers in Saudi Arabia, India and Brazil.","The recovery in international markets is underway and we have the right footprint and the right technology portfolio to take advantage of it. We believe, we\u2019ve demonstrated this by outgrowing our largest competitor internationally for six of the last eight quarters. Importantly, we are in the returns business, not the market share of business. We plan to balance both, to outgrow and make returns in the international market.","The outlook for global commodity supply and demand is constructed. I\u2019m confident that Halliburton has the right strategy, technology and services to compete and deliver leading returns in this market. We remain the leader in North America, which I believe is poised for a better 2019.","Halliburton is also positioned better than it\u2019s ever been for the international recovery. So now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide a few more details on our financial results. Then I\u2019ll return to discuss how we are strategically positioned to differentiate ourselves in the market and deliver returns for our shareholders. Chris?","Chris Weber","Thanks Jeff. I\u2019m going to start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2018. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $6.2 billion which was relatively flat.","Total operating income for the quarter was $716 million, representing a 9% sequential decline. Moving to our division results. In our completion and production division, revenue was relatively flat, while operating income decreased 8%. Revenue was flat, primarily due to lower pricing in our U.S. pressure pumping business, offset by increased incompletion tool sales and well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere.","Operating income was down primarily due to the lower pricing and higher maintenance expense in our U.S. pressure pumping business. As previously discussed, the higher maintenance expense was expected as we performed incremental maintenance in anticipation of 2019 activity.","In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue was also relatively flat while operating income decreased 5%. These results were primarily due to drilling fluids activity declines in North America partially offset by increased drilling related services in Latin America.","In North America, revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by lower pricing and stimulation services in the United States land sector and reduced drilling fluids activity in North America, partially offset by increased activity in our production chemicals and artificial lift product service lines in the United States land sector.","Latin America revenue grew by 9% resulting primarily from increased demand for stimulation services in Mexico and drilling related services throughout the region, particularly in Argentina Brazil and Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by decrease software sales in Mexico.","Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS revenue increased 4% primarily driven by higher pipeline services across the region, coupled with increased completion tool sales in the North Sea. In the Middle East Asia region, revenue increased 4% largely resulting from increased completion tool sales and well intervention services throughout the region, partially offset by lower pricing and stimulation services in the Middle East.","In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $78 million up $7 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the implementation of cost savings projects. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate and other expense to be approximately $75 million.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $140 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same in the fourth quarter. We reported $42 million of other expense for the quarter, up from $19 million in the second quarter. The increase is primarily due to foreign exchange losses that were driven by the strong U.S. dollar and the devaluation of certain emerging market currencies some of which we have limited ability to hedge.","For the fourth quarter, we think $40 million is a good estimate for other expense. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 19%, which was lower than anticipated due to discrete tax benefits. Looking ahead, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to range between 20% and 21%.","Turning to cash flow, we ended the quarter with a total cash balance of $2.1 billion. We generated approximately $780 million of cash from operations during this quarter. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $410 million, and our full-year 2018 CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion.","Before I turn to the fourth quarter guidance, I want to take a minute to discuss capital allocation, which we view like everything else at Halliburton through our returns focused wind. We had three uses for our excess cash.","Return of cash to shareholders, debt retirement and growth. Regarding return of cash to shareholders, we pay a solid dividend and we initiated share repurchases during the quarter buying back $200 million in shares.","Going forward, we will continue to consider share repurchases when we have excess cash. Regarding debt retirement, this quarter, we repaid our $400 million note that matured in August. With this payment complete, we have now paid that $2 billion in debt over the last two years, which is a great accomplishment.","We have previously discussed repaying our $500 million 2021 maturity; however, we have decided not to do that this year. As we evaluate current potential opportunities, including share repurchases, we believe that there are more attractive opportunities for using this cash.","Regarding growth, we will continue to pursue value accretive growth opportunities, be it both on M&A or stepped out organic growth. Investing in the business increases the value of our company and Halliburton has a great track record of making smart investment decisions that generate industry leading returns, and we plan to continue to do so.","Now, turning to the guidance for the fourth quarter. As is typical, a combination of weather, holidays, budget constraints and year-end sales make forecasting a challenge, but this is how we currently see it playing out.","In our C&P division, we expect the results to be down in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the North America land market, where we expect the activity level of our pressure pumping customers to decrease by a low double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter.","This will mean lower utilization for our equipment, less efficient operations and continued pricing pressure. Also, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we will continue performing incremental maintenance in the fourth quarter to prepare for a busy 2019.","In our D&E division, we expect our results to improve slightly primarily due to typical year-end sales. As a result, we expect earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Miller","Thanks Chris. As I see it, this cycle is shaping up to be a marathon, not a sprint. The key to successfully running a marathon as I can tell you from personal experience is being physically and mentally prepared for the long run. Now I\u2019d like to highlight what Halliburton is doing today to be ready for this sustained cycle.","I talked to you a lot about technology. Let me remind you why it\u2019s important. We expand our technology portfolio to gain scale, grow market share, create competitive advantage and win both internationally and in North America.","We are deliberately investing in technologies and capabilities that we believe will do three things; drive growth, create meaningful differentiation and deliver returns. In our drilling and evaluation division, we recently launched the new iCruise Rotary Steerable System. It\u2019s the most intelligent drilling tool in the market. It combines smart technology with advanced electronics, sophisticated algorithms, multiple sensors and high-speed processors with some of the highest mechanical specifications on the market.","Tools already been deployed for customers and three U.S. unconventional basins as well as internationally. We are excited about the iCruise System, not only because it delivers fast drilling, accurate well placement and reliable repeatable performance for our customers, but also because the simple, modular design of this tool and its self diagnostics capabilities mean that it\u2019s maintenance takes a lot less time, which increases asset velocity, reduces repair and maintenance costs and improves returns for Halliburton.","Our EarthStar, ultra-deep resistivity service, another innovation from the Sperry Drilling product line played a large part in helping us win several important contracts in the North Sea. This new logging haul drilling center delivers the unique ability to map reservoir and fluid boundaries more than 200 feet from the well board, over twice the depth of current industry offerings. It gives operators a much clearer view of the reservoir helping to precisely geosteer [ph] their wells and to achieve higher production, lowering cost per BOE.","Adoption of this new well placement technology is occurring not only in the North Sea and other offshore markets, but even in North American unconventional. We plan to build on this momentum to grow our business in these markets to drive differentiation and deliver returns for Halliburton.","As I\u2019ve said, Halliburton makes technology investments to deliver growth, differentiation and returns. So what does this look like in our completions business? Halliburton is the market leader in completions and hydraulic fracturing and we continue to innovate. Our technology and operations teams are constantly working on new opportunities for advancement, for creating meaningful differentiation from our competitors and for saving cost for us and our customers.","For the last several years, we\u2019ve made significant investments in our surface efficiency strategy. We\u2019ve introduced technologies, like ExpressKinect, Wellhead Connection unit, ExpressSand system and IntelliScan equipment monitoring software. They have helped us achieve a 50% reduction in rig up, rig down time cut cycle time between stages in half and reduced our maintenance cost per horsepower hour. These investments drive returns for Halliburton. They allow us to charge a premium for our equipment. They improve our asset velocity and they have reduced the required capital on the well site.","While the industry has been focused on implementing surface efficiencies to squeeze costs out of the system, I believe that the next step forward in efficiency will come from higher wealth productivity achieved through better subsurface understanding. In our quest to provide the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent, refocusing on increasing the number of barrels for our customers through subsurface insight.","To this end, in addition to service efficiency, we\u2019re investing in the technology to help our customers improve well productivity. This is our intelligent frac strategy. I\u2019m pleased to see the growing customer interest and willingness to pay a premium for better well placement and better fracturing efficiency, which leads to more barrels and lower cost.","During the third quarter, we launched our Prodigi AB intelligent fracturing service, and by the end of 2018 it will be deployed in every unconventional basin in the U.S. If the inaugural element of our Intelligent frac strategy and the first commercial solution on the Prodigi platform. When we hydraulically fracture a well, we force fluid and sand into the rock thousands of feet below the surface.","Prodigi AB Service utilizes algorithms to fine-tune the pump rate based on reservoir response without human intervention. It allows for real-time adjustments to treating pressure during initial pumping conditions which leads to consistently higher breakdown efficiency and improves proppant placement.","Prodigi AB has been deployed on over 500 stages across multiple customers and basins. In a recent trial, Prodigi AB demonstrated our ability to achieve consistent breakdown across the entire stage which leads to better well productivity for our customers.","Additionally, Prodigi AB lowers treating pressure by nearly 10% and cuts pumping times by 10 to 15 minutes per stage. This means reduced wear and tear on our equipment and lower maintenance costs.","Well productivity is not only dependent on job execution, but it's also greatly affected by job design. Our Prodigi AB assist with consistent job execution, the newest addition to the Halliburton Intelligent frac portfolio, GOHFER, Fracture Modeling Software ensures that we have the right designs to execute.","We\u2019ve recently acquired this industry-leading fracture simulator which is used globally for conventional and unconventional well completion designs, analysis and optimization. This acquisition enhances our frac business and I'm excited to welcome GOHFER into the Halliburton family.","And as I said earlier, this will be a mature fields led recovery. Halliburton is investing in our portfolio of production capabilities that will allow us to grow share, differentiation and returns in this market.","Our production group grew revenues 36% year-over-yea as we\u2019ve made significant strides expanding our position in artificial lift and production chemicals, all key capabilities in the mature fields domain.","It's been over a year since we bought Summit. In that time, we\u2019ve expanded our market share in the U.S. and started delivering this product offering into the international markets.","We've experienced exceptional growth. And I can tell you there are still significant growth opportunities ahead. We\u2019re bringing the full power of the Halliburton global footprint to bear and taking our ESP offering to the Middle East and Latin America. The customer feedback is positive and we intend to grow this business into a global market leader.","As you may remember, in the second quarter we entered into the reactive chemistry space through the acquisition of Athlon Solutions. We expect Athlon will enhance growth and profitability in our Multi-Chem product service line and across our chemistry portfolio.","This acquisition is the first step in developing our reactive chemistry capability in North America and complements our ongoing efforts to manufacture chemicals in the international markets.","I'm excited about these additional capabilities and look forward to their future growth and contribution. Athlon and Summit are two great examples of how we use targeted M&A to enhance our portfolio and drive returns.","Halliburton maximizes returns our technology investment by being the most effective in the market at lowering our customers cost per BOE. This is what gives us significant market share in North America and internationally, and this is why Halliburton is well-positioned to compete win and deliver industry-leading returns in both of these markets.","In summary, we know the North American market and will manage through the temporary challenges. The catalysts for 2019 rebound are clear and Halliburton is best positioned to take advantage of what we expect to be a sustained up-cycle ","We believe that the international markets are in the early stages of recovery. Despite competitive pressures Halliburton is well-positioned internationally to win and make returns. And finally, we are a returns-focused company. Everything my team and I do is aimed at continuously delivering industry-leading returns.","Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","James West","Hey, good morning guys.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, James.","James West","Jeff, I was wondering if you could expand a bit on your \u2013 on the catalysts you see for 2019, being a much better year for the industry both North America and International. I mean, we agree with that, but I\u2019m curious as \u2013 since you\u2019re closer, obviously, to your customers than perhaps we are. Could you maybe talk through some of those major key catalysts that you see driving significant growth next year?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, James. Yes. The outlook or the catalysts are clearer than probably they\u2019ve ever been which is a bit of a rarity in our business, but as we now look at the budget resets we know that has to happen, we know that will happen, our customers have done a good job of working sort of within their budget this year. But as we look at 2019 and a higher commodity price that really sets up well for adding to budgets in the next year. And at the same time if we look at DUCs, DUCs are at historical high. Those are the kind of things that get worked off.","We get back to the higher global oil price, that has an impact on hedging as hedges roll off, new hedges get put on. So again, all of these are things that we can see and certainly leaves me to a view that Q1 is better than Q4, and that momentum would then build on the back of all of those catalysts. As far as the timing of those catalysts, look like they happen next year. I\u2019m not going to try to call it timing, but confidence it they happen.","The -- internationally, similarly the underspend that\u2019s happened for the last three years pretty extraordinary, and I think that just the requirement to reinvest in a lot of these places is driving what I see as the recovery.","James West","Got you. And maybe just to follow up on international side, Jeff, it seems to me like the portfolio strategy that was put in place by you and your largest competitor, perhaps starting year, year and a half ago to make sure you\u2019re setup in the right market for the right contracts. It should be mostly over at this point and it should be time to get going on pricing. Is that a fair statement?","Chris Weber","Well, it stays fairly competitive internationally. And so I can point to anecdotes where we are able to get pricing, but the bigger projects remain very competitive. When I look at those kind of projects certainly the \u2013 we have a bias for returns. But I think we\u2019ve demonstrated, we can grow in that market, not growing that market, but at the same time I think the competitive pressure is probably more than we think. Those contracts will get worked off, will get work through and optimized, but I do think that will take a little bit of time.","James West","Okay. Got it. Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Scott Gruber","Yes. Good morning. So, Jeff, I just want to clarify the earnings bottom comment, is that just a comment on North America or is that a global comment? Basically, I\u2019m curious if North American recovery in 1Q can more than offset the seasonal weakness abroad that we think we\u2019ll se in 1Q?","Chris Weber","Yes. Well, it\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s not a global comment. We look at North America; I'm pretty excited about what we see. The Q4 looks like a bottom. The recovery -- rather than call it the timing and pace of it, we\u2019ve talked about the catalysts that happened next year. When I think about the technology that we\u2019re investing in around surface efficiency and maybe more importantly subsurface efficiency, I think all of those things frame up where I\u2019m pretty excited about 2019.","Internationally, there\u2019ll still be some seasonality that we always see in international, Q1 to Q2 to Q3 which has sort of a fairly predictable cycle. So internationally excited about the recovery, it continues. But it's a little bit different than the North America that we think about.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And then just -- an unrelated follow-up on the new Rotary system, the iCruise system, do you think that system closes the technology gap with Schlumberger and Baker?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Look, I'm super excited about this technology. I mean it's doing what I thought it would do. Its performance is terrific and it\u2019s equally important its performance is terrific in my view, at a lower cost and that makes returns for us both of those do. And so, I think as I said in my comments its in three markets; North America, we\u2019ve got it international today. It\u2019s doing what I thought it was capable of doing. And really we\u2019re -- like everything it\u2019s a journey and so there\u2019ll be more to come.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sean Meakim","Thanks. Hey, good morning.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Meakim","So it seems to me the key for investors here is going to be getting confidence that 4Q is in fact the bottom and I think many folks will remember the challenges the industry had to start last \u2013 this most recent year. So how do you characterize the interplay between C&P volumes and pricing in 3Q? And we had topline flat margin off 140 bps. And just what\u2019s the read-through to 2019 to give you confidence that frac pricing gets back on track?","Chris Weber","I\u2019ll take that sort of a third quarter piece. I mean when you look at within our C&P division specific to the North America land, really pricing is the biggest driver activity roughly flat quarter-on-quarter. There\u2019s really, you know when we think about activity coming down is really in relation to the expectation what we would typically see in the third quarter, but on a sequential walk, roughly flat, so really pricing story in the third quarter. Moving into the fourth quarter, it\u2019s going to be more activity, as we see pullback from our customers, budget exhaustion and your seasonality taking effect.","Jeff Miller","Yes. So, when we look ahead I\u2019ve described the catalyst. I\u2019ve been less prescriptive on the timing of those catalysts but they start to happen in 2019. And I think that \u2013 I\u2019ve talked to customers. They\u2019re eager to get to work. Obviously there\u2019s seasonality that happens in the fourth quarter and into Q1, but we get on the road to a better market as those things that do happen, happen. So for example, by that I mean budgets they do reset, companies get back to work. And I think generally there's bias to do more next year not less particularly with where the price is. So without being as prescriptive those things start to happen in 2019.","Sean Meakim","Okay. Fair enough. Chris, maybe could we get little bit more granularity on the decision-making around the debt repayment, maybe kind of stepping back from that as opposed to some other choices for allocating cash as we go into 2019. Just curious kind of how you should set investor expectation towards the long-term goals on dept-to-cap versus the other priorities that you are obviously also focused on?","Chris Weber","We\u2019re focused on a strong balance sheet. I mean this doesn\u2019t change our perspective on our target debt metrics. We\u2019ve talked debt-to-EBITDA being underneath two and half times which definitely, line of sight on that, debt-to-cap being in the mid 30s. And that will take time to work towards. Maybe we have a strong balance sheet today. I think it continues to get stronger over time. But when we look at just opportunities for using that cash right now and we take into account the progress that we've made repaying debt $2 billion over the last two years, 400 million of that in the third quarter. And again in relation to opportunities that we see now including share repurchases we just feel like there's better uses for that cash right now.","Sean Meakim","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.","Bill Herbert","Good morning. Jeff, can you discuss with regard to Q1, which basins do you think will be strongest earliest and which ones will lag relative to Q4, in terms of activity?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Bill, all behave differently I suppose. I would say, probably Eagle Ford response probably more quickly with budget resets. I think probably we\u2019d expect some response in the Northern Region as we -- or say Northern Region, DJ, Eagle Ford, -- DJ and sort of Bakken as things reset up there. But the -- it will happen in as it happens. Certainly the weather can be in that mix, but I actually -- getting back to work broadly I think is certainly the most impactful piece of that and customers really want to.","I think that budget discipline, our capital discipline that we saw this year to a degree, the reaction in Q2 is sort of had a carry on effect and so I feel like as things reset there\u2019ll be lot more appetite to do more. Bill.","Bill Herbert","Okay. So, I just want to -- I\u2019m trying to get at, with regard to your discussions that you're having with customers who are Permian focused, even -- I\u2019m trying to understand, are they also telling you that Q1 given the budget reload, strong commodity prices, better hedging opportunities, they\u2019re going to be off to the races too? Or do you expect them to lag a little bit waiting for incremental pipeline capacity as that unfolds over the course of 2019?","Jeff Miller","Yes. The trouble, Bill, every customer is different and each has their own strategy and response to what out there. So I\u2019m careful when I make blanket statements. So, if you just step back and look at the kind of consolidation that\u2019s happen in that market, that certainly doesn't happen to do less, the kind of activity that we see out there. So the timing and pace, so I think will be an individual decision by different customers, but clearly they\u2019ll be a reloading that goes into next year.","Bill Herbert","Okay. That's fair. And then Chris with regard your guidance, I\u2019m sorry, I think, I understood C&P down double digits for reasons you expressed. I think I heard you say D&E up in the fourth quarter. Would margins for D&E would be flat to up in Q4 or how would you expect that to unfold?","Chris Weber","I think we\u2019ll see slight improvement in both revenue and margins in D&E. Like I said, largely driven by year-end product sales or I should say software sales from Landmark which should be difficult.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Which is the last one -- which leads into that last one from me. So that implies kind of the C&P margin, I think at the low-end of about 12.5%. Would you expect that to be the trough margin for C&P?","Chris Weber","Right now, Jeff, talked about the North America land reaching a bottom in the fourth quarter. Don't want call bottom on anything else at this point, but we do think from an activity perspective North America land in the fourth quarter feels like a bottom.","Bill Herbert","Okay.","Jeff Miller","I mean the cyclicality will occur internationally, Bill, there are other things in there that \u2013 there\u2019s Latin America, there is North Sea. We do quite a bit of C&P work in a lot of different markets. So, just don't want to call that right now.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jud Bailey","Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, question for you as we sit back and kind of look at the industry, one question I think lot of people are asking is, as we go to year end there\u2019s a lot of excess frac capacity sitting on the fence, efficiency gained across the industry have been very solid. As things start to improve in 2019 how do we think about the industry regaining in pricing leverage and frac? Do you believe if we will get any -- I\u2019d appreciate any comments on how you think about pricing leverage kind of swinging back on any kind of activity increase in 2019?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks. I mean there's a couple of things. It starts with customer urgency. And what we're seeing with budgets right now is sort of the opposite of customer urgency. When we see that creep back in around higher commodity prices more activity to do, I expect we'll see opportunities for pricing leverage swing back to service providers. We saw that early this year. We saw a quite a bit at the year before. I don\u2019t expect it to be different. I think the equipment today, I\u2019ve said it many times, it is working harder than it\u2019s ever worked and that means equipment is wearing out at a pace that it's not as abundant as one might think.","I think the second piece though that over time is \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to talk about technology of over time being around the subsurface, which I spent time talking about Prodigi which is beginning piece of that and also go for this quarter, but many other things we\u2019re doing around modeling that really ask how do we make more barrels or how do customers make more barrels per well and I think that's going to be very important over time.","Jud Bailey","Okay. All right and thank you. And my follow-up is in the past you\u2019ve referenced the ability to get to 20% margins. Do you feel like with the way the industry is kind of situated today, and not putting a timeframe on it, but is that still an expectation or a goal for Halliburton over the intermediate term? I guess, is that achievable in your mind given the technology initiatives, efficiency initiatives and kind of how you see pricing playing out?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks. When I step back and look at it, right now, we're on and I think the best business in the big service market today. And under the right conditions can we get there? Yes. I believe we can. But that doesn't change what we're doing today in terms of addressing the market, making the best returns in the market and truly investing in this market for the long-term.","Jud Bailey","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Jeff Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jim Wicklund","Good morning, guys. What we really like is the exact day and the hours if you can provide it, of the inflection when things are going to start getting better? And whether it would be a weekday or weekend? Jud questions were most critical I think because investors aren\u2019t sure where margins bottom or will be when activity starts to recover or at least pricing starts to recover? And you already noted that the pricing is being more impactful right now than utilization, and you talked a little bit about efficiency.","One thing we're hearing is that you guys and your peers are getting so efficient in terms of fracking that maybe we don't need as many frac spreads out there as we did before. And we\u2019ve seen this happen with drilling rigs as they went through a significant period of efficiency. Is the same thing going to happen to pressure pumping over the next couple of years guys?","Jeff Miller","Well, I don't think so. I mean I think there's a lot of demand for what we do, and I think the equipment gets worked harder and it will -- the technology of better pumps and those kind of things will prevail over time from an efficiency standpoint, but I think the bigger piece of efficiency that I was talking about earlier is around productivity and the investment and that I think will drive a lot more demand for what we\u2019re doing. I mean, the core of the core is only \u2013 is a finite resource. So I think as we look out what we\u2019re doing around our intelligent frac strategy and what customers will have to do in order to be successful, will continue to consume more, not less, I guess, for lack of a better word.","Jim Wicklund","How much more and you talk some about your technologies that you\u2019re developing, and all that\u2019s exceptionally impressive, for an old simulation engineer anyway. How much more efficiency, however you want to manage -- describe it, how much more efficiency can we wring out and hydraulically fracturing unconventional wells. Where can we go if we've taken Permian wells from 257 IPs to 2000, where does this all in? Where do we get to the point where we\u2019re so much steady state and how efficient are we at that point?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think the efficiency lever is progressively harder to pull in terms of amount of time. I mean, literally more sand, bigger stages, takes longer to pump. I mean, you start to reach, generally, limits around what faster looks like. And there's a lot of debate at the minutia level around A versus B but realistically, overall, how much more does that move? When I think about making better wells over time, I think that will be more and more significant, just because the complexity of how this gets done will increase. And, typically, it involves working equipment harder, even if not necessarily faster, which I think keeps us all very busy over a much longer period of time, over the long-term. And so for that, I mean, I just continue to see the demand certainly for what we do and I think that technology component will become progressively more important.","Jim Wicklund","And my follow-up, if I could. We listened to one company the other day talk about the benefits of being vertically integrated in sand. You\u2019re noticeably not. Can you tell us what the benefit of not being vertically integrated in sand is?","Jeff Miller","Well, yes, I look at everything through a returns lens. And back up. When we allocate capital and we think about what we do, I look first at what do we do that\u2019s unique? What can we do that is unique and drive differentiation? And with respect to sand, we do more around moving it and pumping it and that\u2019s really our uniqueness. So you see us spend our capital on either equipment or technology around that equipment that don't add much technically to a grain of sand. And we\u2019ve got great partners that we work with and I think we have always found that there's plenty of sand in the marketplace and the best thing to do is make the best returns. And I don\u2019t see that for us with sand.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. Thanks guys and good guide down for Q4. Reset the bar. Good job. Thank you.","Jeff Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Anderson","Hey, good morning, Jeff. I just want to talk a little international here for a change of pace. You had some really nice growth you showed here sequentially. I was just wondering if you could talk about which parts of your international business you think have the most potential for 2019. And do you think a double-digit international revenue growth for the full year is achievable?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Look, I\u2019m real excited about our drilling activity. I talked about technology but what we\u2019re doing with Sperry and how that has an impact on all of our business, I think that's important. I think I\u2019m also excited about C&P internationally. We\u2019ve got a pretty big book of that out to go do and I think there\u2019s a lot of demand in markets to address, either unconventional or tight formations, in an effort to make more production.","But I also think, if we look out at 2019, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag in the sense that there are going to be markets like Asia Pacific and Europe, Africa, Eurasia that, in my view, recover more so, pretty strongly, on a percentage basis, just given where they started. But there are other parts of the market, Middle East, that have been fairly resilient throughout the downturn. And so that, while fantastic business and market, may mute to a degree that absolute amount of growth. But to be seen, if I look at next year, we're looking on the plan now. But are we high single digits? Are we double digits? That feels like about the range.","David Anderson","Then you had mentioned spare capacity issues internationally. You just referred to your C&P side, your drilling side. Is that where you see the tightness? Are you suggesting that there\u2019s an improving pricing outlook out there? Can you just kind of touch on that a little bit for a few minutes?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I think the drilling equipment is probably the tightest thing in the marketplace today. And as it gets -- as we work into 2019; that will drive, I suspect, a better view of pricing, better pricing. Again, on anecdotally, we have discussions every day with customers. But at the same time, big projects continue to be competitive. So that\u2019s why that\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. I think we've got the ability to optimize those things as we work through 2019 and I suspect it's a better year, certainly, than last year as it recovers..","David Anderson","And then just last thing. On the offshore side, do you think offshore contributes much to next year's number or is that more of a 2020 event, based on your conversations with your IOC customers?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean, IOC -- well, let's back up. Take offshore as far as deep water versus shelf, then deep water, it'll be -- I think it plays a role. It certainly does. North Sea, we've talked about North Sea and as that sort of gains momentum into next year. But generally speaking, it's going be mature fields. So if I slice it by mature fields versus offshore or onshore, it feels, certainly, like that\u2019s a better part of the business. And, again, from Halliburton\u2019s standpoint, it lines up perfectly well with what we do, in terms of completions and I talked about what we\u2019re doing around wireline and case fill wireline and some of those kind of things. So I think it shapes up really well for us.","David Anderson","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeff Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead","Hey and good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. So, I just want to follow on the recent line of questioning here in the context of international growing high single digit, low double digit, without really kind of holding to you until you get your budgets done. Do you think North America, on a year-on-year basis, will outpace international?","Jeff Miller","Well, they are such different size and sort of pace, it\u2019s hard to say. I mean, I think the international will grow for different reasons, partly being more NOC-led, and that\u2019s really around mandates by governments to produce more. North America is such a dynamic sort of capital market driven growth that if we see -- where we see oil price shape up I think North America has the ability to move faster than we\u2019ve seen that in the past. And I try to describe the catalyst that are out there that would allow that to happen, so I think that let\u2019s get through the planning but from a growth standpoint, it feels stronger in North America but to be seen.","Kurt Hallead","Thanks, Jeff. And from a maintenance standpoint is this the intensity, the maintenance do you think been greater, is it going to be greater during this kind of pause than what\u2019s it\u2019s been over the last couple of years and do you think that could ultimately do additional industry wide fleet attrition?","Jeff Miller","Well I would think for Halliburton and I think we\u2019ll do more maintenance as we go through the Q4 as I described just to be ready for 2019. I think broadly, the size of stages, pressure and rate all conspire to work the equipment harder than it\u2019s ever worked. And so I think we put a lot of effort into managing maintenance how we manage maintenance, the technology of maintenance. We got a tech group that looks at maintenance and so I think all of those things are important to our performance in North America more specifically around doing maintenance, we know it\u2019s important and plan to do it as we get through Q4.","Kurt Hallead","Right. And then if maybe finish up. What\u2019s your take, Jeff on electric frac fleets in the potential adoption by the market place?","Jeff Miller","Look, I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s too early to call only \u2013 we\u2019re looking at all types of technology all of the time, but what underpins all of that is returns and uptake and sustainability. And so that\u2019s again I think it\u2019s earlier to call out one, but we are certainly looking at it among other things.","Kurt Hallead","All right. Always appreciate the color. Thank you.","Jeff Miller","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to hand the call over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Yes, thanks Nicole. Look before we close out the call, just like to make a couple of final points. First, I believe Q4 represents the bottom of the temporary North America dislocation. We can see the NAM recovery catalyst and expect Halliburton to benefit as they manifest. Second, I\u2019m excited about the early stage international recovery and believe Halliburton is better positioned than ever for success. And then finally, our strategy and focus on capital allocation positions Halliburton to continue delivering industry leading returns. So I look forward to talking with you next quarter and Nicole, please close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Kelly Youngblood, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development.","I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and recent current reports on Form 8-K.","Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release, announcing the fourth quarter results, which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. We'll welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Dave?","David J. Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, let me begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2011. First, I'm very proud to say that this was a record year for our company, with revenues of $24.8 billion, operating income of $4.7 billion and with growth, margins and returns that led our peer group. To put this in perspective, our business has nearly doubled in size over the last 5 years, primarily from organic growth.","From a division perspective, we achieved record revenues in both our Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation divisions, and I want to thank all our employees for their help in making it happen. The cornerstones of our strategy remain unchanged and include maintaining leadership in unconventional plays, participating in the deepwater expansion and impacting the decline curve in mature fields.","This year, we commercialized key technologies consistent with these growth themes, and Tim will discuss them later. As the industry leader in unconventional shale plays, we performed the first shale fracs in numerous countries around the globe, including Argentina, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Poland. We are now starting to invest more heavily in building out our pressure pumping footprint in the international marketplace. We are also continuing to invest in our deepwater business and have secured key contract wins in East Africa, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, China, Brazil and other markets and are building infrastructure to support this work.","In addition, it's important to note that our service quality continues to be recognized by our customers, as Tim will also discuss. We believe this improving market position and service quality reputation will benefit us as new build deepwater rigs are scheduled to arrive in the coming years. Our customers are looking for deepwater alternatives that have the capability and technology, and increasingly, that company is Halliburton.","And lastly, we continue to build our capabilities in servicing mature fields and supported that effort with some critical acquisitions in specialty chemicals and artificial lift in 2011 that enabled us to broaden the scope of our mature field offerings to our customers. The most significant of these was Multi-Chem. We expect that synergies and sales, manufacturing and distribution will enable us to deliver additional value to our customers and shareholders as we expand the global footprint of this product line.","I'm very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter as we set new company records in both our North America and international operations. Revenues of $7.1 billion represents the highest quarterly revenue in the company's history, with North America, Latin America and the Middle East\/Asia regions all achieving new record levels. Operating income of $1.4 billion was also a company record and was driven by strong performance in North America and the Latin America regions, where we had year-over-year revenue growth of 56% and 46%, respectively.","Let me start by providing some commentary on North America. The shift from natural gas to liquids-rich plays continues and was quite apparent in the fourth quarter. The U.S. rig count grew 3% sequentially, with oil-directed rigs up 8% and natural gas rigs down 2%. The shift toward oil and liquids-rich plays are a direct result of the stability of higher -- of oil prices and higher operator returns for these resources. Completing these wells requires higher levels of service intensity due to advanced fluid and completion technologies and creates an additional opportunity for us to otherwise differentiate ourselves from the competition.","We have highlighted for some time the dramatic impact that oil-directed horizontal activities has had on the North America market. For instance, in addition to natural gas rigs targeting liquids-rich plays, the oil rig count now represents more than 60% of the total in North America, a level we have not seen in decades. Our customers' sources of revenue has also shifted dramatically toward oil, with the sale of U.S. oil and liquids representing approximately 70% of total upstream revenue today. This compares with an approximate 50-50 split just 5 years ago. And our customer mix continues to shift toward IOCs, NOCs and large independents, who tend to have a more stable spending pattern and more sophisticated supply chain management and away from those customers who might be more financially challenged in the current market. We are also seeing a trend toward higher average footage drilled per well, up to approximately 7,000 feet from 5,000 feet just 5 years ago. And finally, today, reserve development demands 4x as much horsepower per rig as compared to 2004. So clearly, there's been a dramatic shift over the past several years, and all of this bodes well for a continuation of high demand in the North America unconventional markets.","So what will that market look like going forward? The last time the breakeven price for oil development was so far below prevailing oil prices was back in the early '80s, when the rig count was more than double what it is today. And despite the vast amount of work we've done in North America in recent years, there's only been a modest increase in net oil production, as new supplies are barely offsetting declines for mature North America basins. As a result, we expect continued liquids-driven activity growth in the coming years, as our customers invest in their resources and optimize their development technologies, and we plan to continue to expand our capability and drive efficiency through technology and logistical improvements to enable this growth.","Now looking at the results for the fourth quarter. Our North America revenue grew sequentially by 6% versus a 3% rig count due to strong activity in the Eagle Ford, Permian Basin, Marcellus, Gulf of Mexico and Canada. Despite this strong revenue growth, operating income declined slightly from the third quarter. And let me go over those reasons.","First, our recent acquisitions and the associated M&A costs that went with them had an impact of approximately one margin point on our North America margins in the fourth quarter. Second, as you know, the Rockies and the Bakken are 2 areas where we have a particularly high market share, and both markets experienced some seasonal impacts yielding inefficiencies, particularly with our commuter crews. The third quarter is historically our most profitable quarter each year in these 2 particular areas, and this year was no different. The impact of the holidays was more pronounced this year in these areas, as customers chose not to compete -- to complete wells through the Christmas holidays.","Thirdly, cost inflation continues to have a negative impact. There is a delay between vendor price increases and when we are able to pass through these increases to our customers. In the natural gas basins, this is becoming more difficult, and we plan to go back to our vendors for price relief in some areas. This will take some time.","Fourth, logistics and proppant supply. While we have a very sophisticated logistics group, there are times when issues arrive that are not within our control. We experienced logistical and proppant supply disruptions in several areas in the fourth quarter, and this impacted the Bakken, Rockies, South Texas and the Permian, all of which had a negative impact on margins. And finally, we experienced inefficiencies associated with frac fleet relocations to address the challenges the industry is facing in 2012, and I'll say more about that in a few minutes.","Also, spot natural gas prices are down 33% in the last 50 days due to the resiliency of natural gas production in a mild winter. In response, we have seen the U.S. natural gas rig count decline 9% over that same period of time, and this change is clearly impacting the industry as we move into 2012, as service companies' resources relocate to the oil basins.","Now we've talked in the past about how we believe it is important to have a balanced portfolio of business in both dry natural gas basins and liquids plays because a large number of our customers have operations in both. Our strategy was to support these customers in the natural gas basins with a hyper-efficiency business model that went beyond just 24-hour operations. We stayed with these customers in the natural gas basins even as other competitors left to chase work in the oil plays. This strategy has worked well and deepened our relationship with these customers. Our understanding with them was that in return for staying with them in the natural gas basins, we would get their work in the liquids-rich plays as equipment became available. This strategy is now playing out to our advantage. As natural gas prices are falling to the sub-250 level, we are proactively working with these customers to now serve them in the oil plays as they shift their capital spend to liquids and away from natural gas.","We have moved or are in the process of moving 8 frac fleets from primarily natural gas plays to liquids plays. This requires redeployment of people and equipment. It disrupts a very efficient operation, and as well, it is requiring us to make adjustments to our supply chain. It's important to understand that these fleets that are moving are not looking for work but in each case now are committed to an existing customer or one who we could not serve before and, in each case, has or will deplace a competitor in the liquids plays.","So while beneficial to us in the long run, these moves do not come out and do not come about without a short-term impact on our margins. First, we lose the productivity of these hyper-efficient 24-hour crews as they move away from locations with a solid infrastructure and a higher level of expertise. Then when they start in a new location, they're not as efficient as they get used to new operating procedures and how the reservoir responds. And finally, there's a doubling up on some costs, as we generally have to use commuter crews while a local crew is changed -- is trained in the new operation.","So we believe that these pressures that come from this on revenues and margins will be limited. The additional benefit we get from these moves is that even more of our revenue will be generated in the liquids plays, while we still have the ability to increase prices, which will help to offset inflation pressure. Furthermore, the shift to the oil basins requires more expensive materials, particularly gels and proppants, which are already in tight supply. Additionally, we believe that the movement of service capacity out of the natural gas basins will eventually help remove the overhang in natural gas supply. So with great success, we dealt with a number of these significant logistical challenges in 2011, and we see them being able to accommodate the tremendous growth that we see as we move into 2011, even though it's created some near-term uncertainty and pressure on margins.","The concern about what will happen in the dry gas basins is a real one. However, there are customers who will continue to drill in these basins, as they have a low-cost gas basis, a hedge bought before the collapse of pricing or contracts to send their natural gas to markets where the pricing is better. These are our customers, and they will continue to need our services in the natural gas areas. And in most cases, we have a long-term contract with them that value the efficiencies we bring, so they can continue to make money even at lower prices. We have not yet exhausted the demand for fleets that we can relocate to those customers who want our services in the liquids basins, and we will continue to do that as necessary. We have established a great position in the U.S. market. And in these uncertain times, I believe that will pay off big for us.","As we look at the market dynamics today and even apply a downside scenario to how it might play out, based on frac equipment adds as well as reduced gas drilling, which would accelerate the equilibrium in the market for pumping, it is clear to us that the strength of liquids demand will provide a cushion to equipment coming out of the dry gas basins. We also believe that there will be a net overall increase in rig count in 2012. Meaning that in our view, the increase in liquids-directed rigs will more than offset the decline in natural gas rigs. We believe a much more pessimistic scenario is currently priced into our stock, and we do not see that happening.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to see a gradual increase in activity levels with our fourth quarter revenue surprisingly now exceeding pre-moratorium levels. We believe we will see an increase in the level of permit approvals in 2012, leading to additional deepwater rigs arriving over the next several quarters. Margins for the Gulf are expected to improve but not to pre-moratorium levels until later this year or into next year as our customers adapt to new regulations.","So while we expect some inefficiency and, therefore, a downward pressure on margins in the near term due to the shift in our geographic and commodity mix that I just discussed, we believe that the idea that North American margins will collapse is a ridiculous one. We believe increased activity from our customers due to support of liquid prices, good access to capital and continued increases in service intensity are very supportive of a healthy market in 2012. Keep in mind, we have also been spending money on improving our cost structure, as we outlined in our Analyst Day, to stay ahead of the competition. And finally, we remain focused on providing superior service to ensure that we are the provider of choice and to maximize the value for our customers.","So overall, we are very optimistic about 2012 and fully expect that North America revenue and operating income will increase over 2011, although we could see margins normalize somewhat through 2012, and we'll have a better view of this absolutely as the year goes on.","Now let's turn to our international results. Latin America had another outstanding quarter, posting sequential revenue growth of 9% compared to a rig count decline of 1%, and their operating income grew 24%. Mexico led the growth with higher drilling activity, consulting services and software sales. Also contributing to the stellar quarter was Colombia, with higher drilling activity, and Brazil. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, these 3 countries combined and grew an impressive 50% year-over-year. Our Eastern Hemisphere experienced 11% sequential revenue growth compared to a rig count growth of 3%, while operating margin improved to 13%, driven by year-end sales of software, completion tools and other equipment.","Also contributing to the strong quarter were improved results in Iraq, Algeria and East Africa. We continue to show progress in the markets that have been negatively impacting our margins over the past few quarters. For instance, in Iraq, we are running 5 rigs today, 2 more than at the end of the third quarter. We expect to add additional drilling and workover rigs in 2012, which will enable us to be profitable as activity levels increase. Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the future of our Iraq operations despite the challenges we went through in 2011.","Libya's production is coming back online, and although we have performed some minor work in the country, we are still awaiting well-defined operational plans from our customers. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we continue to see improvements in Angola and Nigeria. And while startup costs have negatively impacted operating margins in East Africa, we saw overall sequential improvement in this market.","And lastly, we've been taking action over the past few quarters to improve profitability in our Europe\/Africa\/CIS region, and we've made substantial progress in our restructuring efforts and believe we are now well positioned to deliver improved profitability in these markets in 2012.","We have been consistent in our outlook for our international operations. We anticipate international pricing will continue to remain competitive, particular in regard to larger projects. In 2012, we expect to see a gradual improvement, resulting from new rigs entering the market and increased customer budgets, which we believe will be skewed toward deepwater and international unconventional projects. With tight supply and demand fundamentals for oil and international natural gas prices that are often well above North America prices, we believe the drivers of the sustained activity in the Eastern Hemisphere are sound.","So in summary, we expect to see our Eastern Hemisphere margins progress through 2012, with a full year average in the mid-teens, as new projects ramp up, new technology\u2019s introduced and the negative impact of the areas we've mentioned previously continue to abate, which means that we should have Eastern Hemisphere margins in the mid- to upper teens by the end of the year.","We believe that our growth prospects are so strong across all of our businesses that we are increasing our capital spending to the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in 2012. However, we do not expect to increase our pressure pumping horsepower additions beyond the 2011 levels, and we plan to spend -- to send more of this horsepower into our international markets. But we will, of course, maintain our ability to flex the capital as the year goes forward.","So 2011 was a very successful year for the company with revenue growth of 38% and operating income growth of 57%. We saw record activity levels, and we will continue to expand on our market position. I believe we will continue to build on this success, which should put us in the unique position to continue to achieve our objectives of superior growth, margins and returns versus our competitors.","I'll let Mark give you a little bit more detail.","Mark A. McCollum","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide you with our fourth quarter financial highlights. Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $7.1 billion, up 8% sequentially from the third quarter. Total operating income for the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, up 7% from the previous quarter. Our results in the fourth quarter included a $24 million charge in Corporate and Other related to an environmental matter. As a reminder, our third quarter results included an asset impairment charge of $25 million in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. Now going forward, I'll be comparing our fourth quarter results sequentially to the third quarter of 2011, excluding the impact of these charges.","North America revenue grew 6%, while operating income declined 1% compared to the previous quarter. As Dave mentioned, the impact of seasonality, cost inflation and recent acquisitions negatively impacted our North America margins during the quarter. As a reminder, we historically see our first quarter results affected by weather-related seasonality in the Rockies and the Northeast U.S., where we have a high percentage of 24-hour crews, and it's typical to see a sequential revenue and margin decline in the first quarter. In addition, we're expecting some short-term inefficiencies as a result of rigs and equipment moving from natural gas to oil-directed basins. We're anticipating these issues will result in a sequential margin decline of approximately 100 basis points in the first quarter for North America.","Internationally, revenue and operating income grew 11% and 37%, respectively, driven by activity improvements across all our regions and seasonal increases in softwares, completion tools and direct equipment sales at the end of the year. Our international margins improved to 15.2%. About half of the margin increase resulted from our seasonal increase in software and direct sales. The other half of the margin increase was driven by activity improvement in our other operations. Now for the first quarter of 2012, we're anticipating the typical sequential decline in international revenue and margins due to the absence of these year-end seasonal activities, as well as the typical weather-related weakness in the North Sea and Eurasia. As a reminder, this international activity decline has historically impacted our first quarter results by approximately $0.10 per share after tax, and we have no reason to believe it will be materially different in 2012.","Now I'll highlight the segment results. Completion and Production revenue increased $303 million or 8% due to activity growth in North America, and operating income was essentially flat as improved international profitability offset a slight decline in North America. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 7% from higher U.S. land, offshore and Canadian activity. Operating income declined by 2%, primarily due to the holiday downtime, cost inflation, acquisition impacts and fleet moves that Dave described earlier. In Latin America, Completion and Production posted a 5% sequential increase in revenue, while operating income grew by 19% as a result of increased stimulation work in Mexico and higher cementing activity in Colombia and Mexico. In Europe\/Africa\/CIS, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased 15% and 10%, respectively, due to improved vessel utilization in the North Sea, increased cementing work in Angola and higher stimulation activity and completion tools sales in Algeria and Nigeria. In Middle East\/Asia, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased by 8% and 4%, respectively, due to increased work in Iraq, improved stimulation activity in Australia and increased direct sales within the region.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased $213 million or 8%, and operating income was up 30% due to the year-end seasonality of higher software and direct sales, as well as higher activity levels in Mexico, Iraq, Colombia, Brazil and East Africa. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation's revenue and operating income were up 4% and 2%, respectively, due to higher wireline and drill bits activity in both the U.S. land and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as increased software sales in the U.S. and Canada. Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 27%, respectively, primarily due to higher activity levels in Mexico and increased testing and subsea work in Brazil. We also benefited from strong project management activity in Mexico on the Alliance 2 and Remolino projects. In the Europe\/Africa\/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were up 5% and 27%, respectively, due to increased wireline and directional drilling activity across the region, along with the seasonal year-end increase in software sales. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East\/Asia revenue was up 17%, and operating income was almost 1.5x greater than prior quarter levels due to increased direct sales in Asia and higher drilling activity in Iraq.","Now let me address some additional financial items. Our Corporate and Other expense included approximately $23 million for continued investment in our initiative to reinvent our service delivery platform in North America and to reposition our supply chain, manufacturing and technology infrastructure to better support our projected international growth. These activities will continue in 2012, and we anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share, after tax, in the first quarter. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $95 million and $105 million per quarter during 2012.","In November 2011, we issued $1 billion of senior notes. This new debt issuance will increase our interest expense by approximately $10 million per quarter, and we're projecting overall interest expense for 2012 to be approximately $75 million per quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the full year. Looking forward, we currently expect the 2012 effective tax rate will be approximately 33% to 34%. And finally, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.6 billion during 2012.","Tim?","Timothy J. Probert","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to provide some additional detail on the accomplishments that Dave alluded to and some of the technologies which not only have made a substantial contribution to our success in 2011 but will, we believe, underpin our focus areas for growth in unconventional, deepwater and mature assets in 2012.","In the North America unconventional market, we've made great progress in deploying elements of our frac-of-the-future strategic initiative. We're rolling out our first series of Q10 pumps that have demonstrated significant reliability and maintenance advantages in field testing over our current fleet, already generally considered to be the best in the industry. Aggressive deployment of SandCastle storage and advanced dry polymer blenders in 2011 is expected to also provide ongoing improvements in capital efficiency and environmental performance.","We've been particularly pleased with the performance of our GEM wireline analysis tool, which offers rapid evaluation of complex petrophysical properties, called \"Shale Expert.\" It's been widely used in unconventional fields in the U.S. and internationally. We introduced our new RapidFrac sliding sleeve system that provides our customers with a dramatic increase in efficiency for the completion of horizontal unconventional reservoirs. We were also the first to deliver a cemented version of this technology. We realized a 10% reduction in crew size this year, and we expect ongoing improvements as we increase remote job monitoring and complete the deployment of our field mobility program, which will deliver enhanced operations and logistics efficiency.","So in total, we believe our frac-of-the-future initiative will make us the most cost-effective service provider in the industry. We expect it to be fully rolled out in North America by the end of 2012 and will serve as a platform for our investment in international unconventional growth too.","We continue to feel positive about international unconventionals. Customer consulting agreements have given us an opportunity to screen some 150 worldwide unconventional basins and 60 in detail. We are very encouraged by the properties we see in many of these basins and are responding accordingly with capital investment.","Drilling on LWD technology deployment moved rapidly in 2011. Geosteering activity to optimally place wellbores in reservoir sections was up 75% year-on-year, driven by unconventional and deepwater activity. Much of this was based on our award-winning ADR deep-reading resistivity technology.","Sampling technology while drilling has had a special emphasis for us. Our recent GeoTap IDS run offshore was used to gather over 50 pressure and multiple-reservoir fluid samples during drilling operations; an industry first. This allowed the customer to save over 80 hours of rig time and eliminated the need for a competitor's wireline run. We also set numerous records in high-pressure, high-temperature applications in 2011, both for our wireline and drilling technologies. And we continue to see new wins based on this differentiated technology, as our customers increasingly exploit deeply buried reservoirs.","The exciting worldwide launch of DecisionSpace Desktop in 2011 was very well received in the market and contributed to a record profit year for Landmark. Over 1,600 individual licenses were established in the first year, and 46 of our 50 largest customers have either migrated or are in the process of migrating their data to the DecisionSpace platform.","Integrated Project Management activities are on a steep upward trajectory. Despite a slow start in Iraq, revenues for our Project Management segment nearly doubled from 2010. We see this as a major growth platform, and the pipeline in 2012 is strengthening notably in mature assets.","So while we've been pleased with the growth of the technology portfolio and its ability to underpin our top line and margin growth in 2012, we're also very focused on execution and service quality. We're pleased with our performance this year. For example, Sperry drilling and wireline rates of nonproductive time continue to strengthen by 24% and 26%, respectively, from 2009 to 2011. And we continue to receive positive customer feedback, including a top performance review from a European IOC for formation evaluation. The combination of fit-for-purpose technology with excellent execution provides us a strong foundation for 2012 growth. Dave?","David J. Lesar","Thanks, Tim. So obviously, a lot of moving parts this quarter. Let me summarize what I think should be the takeaways. One, we do not believe that there will be a collapse in margins in pressure pumping in the U.S. Therefore, our revenues and operating income are expected to increase in 2012 in North America. We expect our revenue growth will be in excess of the rig count growth in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. We expect our deepwater revenue growth will be in excess of the deepwater rig count growth, while we continue to earn from our customers kudos for our distinctive service quality. And although it will have a short-term impact on our margins, we are proactively moving equipment from dry gas basins to liquids plays, and this equipment is immediately displacing competition. We expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to return to the mid- to high teens by the end of 2012, as we gain traction on new projects and growing our revenue faster than rig count. And lastly, our positive view of the market supports a capital spending of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. But let me reiterate, pressure pumping horsepower additions are not expected to increase over 2011, and we believe more of those will go to the international markets.","So let's turn it over to questions at this point.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Barclays Capital.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A quick question on -- so your North American margins, you mentioned another 100 basis points down in 1Q. Do you expect a -- further, I know you don't expect a collapse but a further deterioration as we go into 2Q, 3Q, or is that where we start to stabilize out? And I guess a follow-up to that is kind of what should normalized margins be in North America?","Mark A. McCollum","I think the answer is at this point, James, that it's too early to tell. Obviously, we said in our comments, we look at the gas market's changes right now with some level of concern. But for the time being, most of those rigs are shifting from dry gas to liquids-rich basins. And as long as the rigs continue to shift, then we should be able to shift equipment. And while there might be some temporary margin impact, we should be able to get back to some level of normalized margins once the cost blip passes. But right now, I think it's still a little bit too early to tell.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just, Mark, remind us what kind of contract coverage you have for the pressure pumping equipment you have in North America today and then for the incremental capacity you have coming in this year?","David J. Lesar","Yes, James, this is Dave. All of our equipment that we have out there today and all that we anticipate bringing out in 2012 is already allocated to a specific set of customers. So none of it will be sort of in the open speculative market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess I'll stick with North America as well, please. If the -- is there -- and ultimately that sense of where margins can go, if you're positioning assets more in liquids markets, what does -- what implications does that have on 24\/7 operations once they're -- once you're doing what you think they should be doing? And maybe just conceptually then, if you have more pricing leverage than you've had in the last 6 months, just talk to us a little bit about where you think sort of the margins can -- let's strip out a couple of things, if you will, but can margins get back to above levels were you saw, say, in the third quarter?","David J. Lesar","Well, I think, obviously, as we -- as they shift into the oil basins, the opportunity to go toward 24-hour operations improves. Right now, activity is still fairly robust in those markets, and there's a clear shortage of people and equipment, as well as some of the supply chain issues that we find. And based on all the reports that we get from our guys in the field, we're continuing to get some pricing improvements in those oil- or liquids-rich basins. The problem, I think, that we face as we look forward is what will inflation do? As Dave commented, we're going to have continued challenges with logistics, with the supply chain moving proppants and gels and other things into those basins because they're in short supply. And we're fighting back inflation as hard as we can. Most of the price increases that I think that we're being able to achieve right now are serving to basically offset that inflation. We're going to have to work hard, as Dave commented, to really push back and see if we can get some relief from some of our suppliers as things soften in the gas basins. But we'll have to continue to work to make sure that we can get all of that passed through with the price increases that we get. So I think, as I've said, it's a little early to comment as to how much we can move pricing on a net basis, nor -- I just can't speculate at this point whether we'll be able to go back and get them back above those levels that we had in Q3 or even higher.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood, and I appreciate the color. As a follow-up, related -- coming back to pricing but maybe touching on a couple of things slightly differently, can you comment on price -- your pricing realizations recently in natural -- in dry gas basins? And then actually, can you give us some color on nonfrac-ing pricing in the U.S. as well?","Timothy J. Probert","This is Tim. Clearly, in the dry gas basins, there has been significantly more pressure than there has in liquids basins. I think that one of the things I tried to sort of outline for you here just on the call is a few of the key technologies, which are giving us an opportunity to extract some pricing realization pretty much across the board from drilling evaluation through to -- Drilling and Evaluation through to Completion. So there's leverage, I think, in North America to do that. That's the technology side. And as Dave and others have alluded to, we're also working hard on the cost efficiency side, investing substantially into an effort to lower our cost of delivery. So I think we've got a couple of tools in our chest here to -- in our war chest here to ensure that we minimize the impact of the transfer from dry gas to liquids basins, and then once there, have the tools to make sure that we get value for what we're delivering.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fair enough. But absent the -- and I'll let others go. Absent the technology opportunity set, in nonfrac-ing-related activity, say, in -- also in liquids-rich basins, for example, are you seeing -- whether it is in coiled tubing or whether it's in your drilling suite, are you seeing pricing opportunities like-for-like products today?","Timothy J. Probert","There are some pricing opportunities. I think completions would be a bright spot. Obviously, with the introduction of RapidFrac, I would say that. And to use a negative example, obviously, as you move out of some of the deeper, hotter dry gas basins like the Haynesville, where high-temperature, high-pressure tools have been under great demand, there's less demand for those in liquids-rich basins. So there's a couple of pluses and minuses for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Another question on North America. David, seems like one of the reasons for your success in North America is that you've been able to get your customers to take at least 4 other product lines for new frac spreads when you contract with them for frac equipment. Your competition says this will change when things come back into balance. Do you see it changing? Or do you think this can be a somewhat permanent feature of the business?","David J. Lesar","No, I think it's a -- I think it's more of a permanent feature of where we see the market. We were able to use the leverage of the frac fleet and still continue to use the leverage of the frac fleet -- don't get us wrong that we lost it, it's still there -- to bring some of our other product lines along. What we've been able to do is prove to our customers that by integrating those products together, with a frac, either through an integrated completion or integrated drilling, that there's actually a benefit to doing that. And therefore, our customer gets a well down faster, cheaper, more efficiently or more quickly. So I don't see the world going back to that because I think we've been at this long enough to prove the benefit of that strategy out.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","And my follow-up is an international question. And in your opinion, will increased demand alone start to be the catalyst that gets pricing to improve on large tenders? Or will it take a change in mindset by at least one of the major companies in the business?","Mark A. McCollum","I guess our planning assumption at this point is it's going to take an increase in demand overall. I mean, I think that, clearly, there are situations where service quality and technology can come to bear, that might help us in pricing. But our planning assumption is that the competition -- our competition is continuing to price very, very aggressively to prop up their share positions. And so we're continuing to battle hard on that front, and that means that it's in our -- it's our responsibility to execute well and to continue to roll out technologies to make sure that we can improve our margins and improve our returns over time, at least for the foreseeable future.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay, Mark, just one more quick one. Your international contracts, if you have a-year-or-2 contracts for your frac equipment, do they have a clause which allows the customers to suggest a lower price to you or to ask for a lower price and you then consider it?","Mark A. McCollum","No. They typically don't have a clause that allows them to consider a lower price. A number of them have clauses that allow them to step away from the contractual arrangement after some period of time, and there are usually some penalties and make-wholes that are associated with that. What we're seeing in a number -- as Dave alluded to, when they begin to shift equipment, there also is a discussion of them shifting the arrangements to continue to work with them as the rigs move to the liquids-rich basins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","With regard to your Eastern Hemisphere margins or international in general, if we're looking at a $0.10 hit quarter-on-quarter Q1, due to reasons that you mentioned, which are largely seasonal, are we looking then for the balance of the year in order to hit your mid-teens target on the Eastern Hemisphere front for the year up 200 or 300 basis points per quarter as 2012 unfolds at least?","Mark A. McCollum","I don't want to set specific expectations on that, but yes, I mean, I think when you do the math, that's generally how it's going to need to work.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then with regard to your deployment of pressure pumping internationally and that's going to outpace the deployment of the domestic -- of assets -- of frac-ing assets in North America, is there -- or so is that international deployment, is it at this juncture trying to capture growth option value? Or is it specifically correlated with project ramps, which you've been contracted for or you're in sort of a specific dialogue with customers?","David J. Lesar","No, I think, Bill, it's really the latter. I think the -- if you look at the spaces that we enumerated, where we've done shale fracs last year, those -- you got to think of those as really exploration plays still. But we are having enough discussions with enough customers in those geographies to indicate to us that the demand will be there for that equipment. And similar to what we saw in the U.S., the demand for additional horsepower to do these shale fracs is there. So typically, where the investment is going is to augment the horsepower that we already have in place in these countries to basically take advantage of and have adequate horsepower on standby to be able to do the larger shale fracs versus maybe conventional work we've done there in the past.","Mark A. McCollum","Hi, Bill. This is Mark. I want to just make sure we correct a statement that you said. We weren't saying in our comments that we're sending more horsepower to international than we are into North America in 2012. We're just sending more than we -- to international than we sent in 2011. Higher percentage, okay?","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes, good. And then one more for me. Mark, I'm not sure if you addressed this with regard to your guidance, but corporate expense for 2012, how should we think about that?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, we should run probably in total about $95 million to $105 million per quarter. And we did say in the first quarter, yes, there's going to be $0.02 to $0.03 of -- on an after-tax basis of cost that will be for these corporate initiatives, and that it probably will run in about the $0.02 range for the remainder of the year on an individual quarter. So that's a large part of why the corporate expenses have stepped up on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow up on the international shales as well. A year ago, when I've asked you a question about how many rigs may be working in international shale, I think at that time, the number was maybe in the 10 to 15 kind of range. How has that number changed now in the last 12 months? And where do you expect that number to go in the coming 12 months?","Timothy J. Probert","Waqar, this is Tim, and I'll use an example to sort of maybe help with that, Latin America, which has got quite a lot of opportunities in the combination of Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. And it seems to us that the opportunity continues to grow. In 2012, it sort of feels to us like there's somewhere between 75 and 100 wells which will be drilled for shale activities in Latin America. And just if we put that in perspective with respect to a Haynesville, for example, which is just sort of about 99 rigs or thereabouts at the moment, I mean, clearly, if you divide that -- or multiply that 99 rigs by 3 or, let's say, 4 to 6 wells per year, we're dealing with a significantly smaller opportunity today. But the opportunity is growing and, as David alluded to, we're in the sort of primarily exploration appraisal phase, low horsepower requirements, primarily vertical, now shifting to horizontal, where horsepower requirements are doubling, as well as an increase in activity. So we think 2012 is a pretty good transition year for unconventionals, and we'll see the most significant uptake in '13 and '14.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And now this is just Latin America. How about some of the other markets, Europe or Asia?","Timothy J. Probert","Well, yes, obviously, similar pictures there, too. We're just using Latin America as an example for you, and there are emerging opportunities around the globe. As I alluded to earlier, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to do some basin evaluation work of some 60 basins in detail, and those evaluations are not escaping our customers either. So we're going to see a very positive trend here.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now would it be fair to say that when pressure pumping trucks were traditionally being employed internationally for, let's say, cementing and maybe acidization [ph] jobs, as they shift to fracturing, the revenue potential per crew could increase maybe 10 to 15x, is that fair to say? Or 10x or so?","Timothy J. Probert","It's not math that I've necessarily done, Waqar. I don\u2019t know that we could say right now. There clearly is a substantial revenue pop. I mean, the difference normally in a horizontal well in the U.S. that's frac-ed versus a conventional well\u2019s almost 2x. So yes, you think about the entire revenue opportunity, it's going to step up quite dramatically if that becomes the norm outside the U.S. as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Dave or Tim, in the liquid basins on pressure pumping, can you give us an idea today of what you're seeing in wait time for frac crews today versus 3 months ago, versus 6 months ago?","Timothy J. Probert","Obviously, we're dealing specifically with the liquids-rich basins here just to sort of to -- obviously, dry gas is different. But I think that we can -- based on the reports from our field guys, we're still very heavily booked through Q1, which is pretty much as far as we ever look out. So that, to us, is a good indication.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then given that you're mobilizing equipment from your gas basins into the liquid basins, I assume others are doing the same. Could we reach a balanced market in the liquids basins earlier than originally expected?","Timothy J. Probert","I think, as Dave alluded to, we continue to expect to see an increase in rig count. And as you have noted yourself, probably our customer base is striving to balance their dry gas and liquids-rich exposure, and we're seeing a significant shift, if you like, from their dry gas element of their portfolio to the liquids element of their portfolio. So it's not just a function of individual customers stopping activity. It's the transference of activity. And also, we tend to get higher service intensity in liquids-rich basins, which, obviously, is beneficial in terms of the overall revenue picture.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Very, very helpful. And finally, just you talked about mobilization and you were talking -- speaking earlier about the cost and logistic issues, and it seems like you're still getting your head around will that continue through Q1 and into Q2 and the time horizon. But at least on the mobilizing of 8 crews from the gassy plays to the liquid plays, when will that be completed by? And from what regions are you moving equipment from? And what regions are you moving it to?","Timothy J. Probert","Well, that will be completed this quarter.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then to what region?","David J. Lesar","Into the -- primarily into the Rockies, the Niobrara, the Bakken, the liquids part of the Marcellus and a couple of other areas that maybe haven't hit the radar screen yet.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Anderson with JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can I just get a little clarity on your capacity additions in North America on pressure pumping? You're just growing at a slower pace in '12, is that -- or is it going to be flat versus '11?","David J. Lesar","Well, the amount of horsepower that we will be producing is going to be flat on a year-over-year basis. There'll be more going into international than we did in 2011, which then means that there will be a fewer amount of horsepower going into North America. The numbers go up on a year-over-year basis because of the manufacturing of the Q10 pump, which is in full production as we speak, and then as well as the addition of other kit to go along with that, the replacement of blenders and the SandCastle and other equipment, that's part and parcel to our frac-of-the-future strategy.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Now should we interpret this as your views that the market is getting closer to being in balance? Or is this just -- or is this somewhat of a reaction to what's happening in natural gas? How should we interpret that?","Timothy J. Probert","I think one of the things that we should respond to there is the fact that, particularly with the Q10 pump and some of our other capital investments that Mark mentioned here, the SandCastle's ADP blenders, et cetera, much more efficient set of assets. And the Q10 pump, in particular, is going to be very substantially more efficient than the current fleet. So we just -- we'll not need to put as many assets into the marketplace to cover the same territory.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I guess one last question. People have been asking about artificial lift for the last 5 years, and you finally do an acquisition on Global Oilfield Services. Can you talk a little bit about it? Does this fully address your needs in artificial lift? And can you talk a little bit about kind of the strengths of this business and where you think you need to build out more?","Timothy J. Probert","We certainly have talked about artificial lift for a long time, specifically ESPs. And Global is an opportunity for us to enter that segment, for us to extract knowledge and continue to build that business. It's a relatively small business today and one which we have a long horizon on to build its capability and expand it into other areas of artificial lift, but pleased to have it under our belt.","Kelly Youngblood","Okay.

First, total company revenue of $5.9 billion declined 16% sequentially compared to a 26% decline in the worldwide rig count. I'm also very pleased with our Eastern Hemisphere margin expansion, which once again outpaced our primary competitor. We generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. Operating income declined as a result of lower activity levels exacerbated by pricing (04:13) declines primarily in North America. Revenue for North America was down 25% sequentially, significantly outperforming the 40% decline in the average rig count. And while the North American rig count declined 40%, our stage count declined less than 10%. Therefore, we believe that a customer flight to quality emerged during the quarter. And this gives us reason to believe that pricing declines may begin to decelerate. And I can tell you, our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable in this market.","And although we experienced some weather disruptions, we were able to make up this work later in the quarter. We continue to maintain an infrastructure well beyond current market needs, ahead of the Baker transaction, incurring costs which we would have otherwise eliminated. This impacted margins by 300 basis points to 400 basis points in Q2, and decremental margins this quarter were better than previous cycles, which demonstrates that our aggressive cost reduction initiatives are helping to offset the current market challenges.","The U.S. rig count finished the quarter down 55% from the peak in late November, but has moved sideways over the last few weeks. Price erosion continued in the second quarter and is likely to remain fluid in the near term. We anticipate margin compression in the third quarter, but believe it will be driven more by the full impact of pricing declines that we gave up in the second quarter and from lower activity levels more than continued price erosion. In fact, we believe that service pricing for the industry has fallen to unsustainable levels. Last quarter, we described three types of service companies in the market: those making a profit, which weren't very many; those covering cash costs and those operating at a loss, even on a cash basis.","During the first quarter, Halliburton was one of just a few companies that posted profits in North America. And we expect the second quarter has been even more challenging for those of us in the industry. As a result, we believe many of the smaller service companies are now operating below cash breakeven levels, which leads to the conclusion that pricing cannot stay at these levels for an extended period.","Now, looking ahead, we could begin to see a modest uptick in activity during the second half of this year, which could include increased refrac activity, which Jeff Miller will detail later. However, we are not expecting a meaningful activity increase until sometime in 2016, depending on the pace of production declines and where commodity prices settle out in the coming quarters. Therefore, what we are continuing to do is manage our cost, service our customers that are engaged in this flight to quality, and prepare for the Baker transaction.","Now, outside North America, I'm very happy with where our international business is today. Our full year outlook for our international businesses remains unchanged. We still estimate a mid-teens decline in total international customer spend compared to last year. However, we expect to outpace the total market and believe our revenue decline will be less severe. We also anticipate our third quarter Eastern Hemisphere margins will be in the upper teens.","Now, let me provide a little bit of international of regional color. In the Middle East\/Asia, we see a solid and stable business as project awards across the Middle East are moving forward. Europe\/Africa\/CIS is challenged today with the North Sea, Russia and Angola markets being the most vulnerable; and in Latin America, operators are struggling with their cash flows. Although the international markets are more resilient than North America, they are certainly not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. We did experience some pricing declines in the first half of the year, but negotiations are continuing and we will not see lower pricing fully built into our run rate until the second half of the year.","In addition, we are continuing to work with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. The execution of our strategy in addressing this environment remains the same. We are continuing to employ a two-pronged approach. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. To do this, we continue to invest in key technologies, build out capital equipment, and prepare for our pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. The second part of our approach is managing through the downturn joined upon our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. We are aggressively lowering our input costs, eliminating discretionary spending, managing our business within our cash flows, and protecting our market position.","Now, I would like to provide you with an update on the significant progress we are making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition. Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. During the quarter, we began marketing for sale, our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses.","In early July, we received nearly 25 indications of interest for each of the businesses, all of which included prices, and we are very pleased with the prices and the response. Because of the high level of interest we received, we are limiting the number of bidders for the second round to only the strongest responses. We expect to complete the auction process sometime this fall with the closing of the divestitures being concurrent with the closing of the larger transaction.","We have also recently provided a proposal for additional divestitures to various competition authorities around the world. In aggregate, the total divestitures being considered are still within the scope of those contemplated by us at the time that we announced the transaction.","On July 10, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes entered into a timing agreement with the DoJ. Timing agreements are often entered into in connection with large, complex transactions, and provide the DoJ additional time to review responses to its second request. We have agreed to extend the period for their review of the acquisition to the later of November 25, 2015, or 90 days after both companies have certified substantial compliance with the DoJ's second request.","I am pleased to say that Baker Hughes did certify substantial compliance on July 14, and we expect to do so shortly. Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with the required filings in foreign jurisdictions. Specific to the European Union, we expect to submit our filings later this month, which will start the formal review process. We are fully committed to our target of closing the acquisition in late 2015, though the acquisition agreement does provide the closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion regardless of market conditions or any cost reduction actions taken by either company through that date.","In closing, we are enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil services company, combining our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Christian who will provide you some details on our financial results. Christian?","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we announced our decision to divest our Drill Bits and Drilling, MWD\/LWD businesses. These businesses were classified as assets held for sale in the second quarter, and we ceased the associated depreciation and amortization for these assets, resulting in an approximate $0.06 benefit to the quarter. We've included a table in our earnings release quantifying the second quarter profit uplift by geography.","To provide better transparency of our current operational trends, the sequential comparisons in my comments today have been adjusted to exclude the special items indicated in our earnings release, as well as the benefit of the lower depreciation, meaning both the first and second quarter results reflect the full depreciation burden in order to have an apples-to-apples comparison.","Now, let me provide a comparison of our second quarter results to the first quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.9 billion represented a 16% decline, while operating income declined 18% to $570 million. North America led the decline as a result of lower activity levels and continued pricing pressure across all of our product lines.","In the Eastern Hemisphere, second quarter revenue declined by 3%, while operating income increased 17%, representing a 300 basis point margin improvement from the first quarter levels despite activity and pricing headwinds.","In the Middle East\/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% while operating income showed a modest improvement. Lower activity levels across the Asia-Pacific markets were offset by improved profitability in Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. We are pleased with the progress of operations in Iraq where margins reached double digits for the first time, which we expect to sustain for the full year.","Turning to Europe\/Africa\/CIS, we saw second quarter revenue come in flat with operating income increasing by 69%. Seasonal activity improvement's in Eurasia and Norway, along with higher stimulation activity and Completion Tools sales in both Algeria and Angola, drove the improvement for the quarter, offsetting weaker activity levels in the UK and Egypt.","Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 19% and 21%, respectively, driven by Venezuela, primarily due to the negative currency impact of the new exchange rate. Partially offsetting this decline was improved profitability in Brazil resulting from the recently retendered Directional Drilling contract.","Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 25% and 59%, respectively, relative to a 40% reduction in the North America rig count. Lower customer budgets translated into additional reductions in activity levels throughout the second quarter, accompanied by further significant price reductions across all product lines. Our decrementals in the second quarter were 19%, about half of what we experienced in the second quarter of 2009.","During the second quarter, we took additional actions to adjust our cost structure due to the continued decline in global activity levels. As a result, we incurred an additional after-tax restructuring charge of $258 million in the second quarter consisting primarily of severance-related costs and asset write-offs. Since the beginning of the year, we've now reduced our global head count by over 16%. We continue to evaluate our operations and will make further adjustments as required to adjust to market conditions.","Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $17 million for the quarter. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the third quarter will be approximately $75 million, and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the remainder of 2015. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at 26%, and is expected to be between 26% and 27% for the remainder of the year.","We continue to focus on cash flow generation. And given the continued decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital spend for the year by another $200 million to $2.6 billion, representing a 21% year-over-year decline. Manufacturing our own equipment provides us with the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market.","Finally, let me give you some comments on our third quarter operations outlook. My guidance commentary will include the benefit of our lower depreciation and amortization run rate from assets held for sale. Starting with the Eastern Hemisphere outlook, we expect to see a full quarter impact of price reductions, which will affect our third quarter results. We currently expect a low to mid single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins declining modestly into the upper teens. For Latin America, we also anticipate a modest decline in the third quarter for both revenues and margins.","In North America, if we extrapolate the current rig count forward, it suggests that the average rig count for the third quarter should decline by at least 5% compared to the prior quarter. This, in combination with the full quarter impact of lower pricing, leads us to believe that revenues and margins in the third quarter will be under pressure. This pattern is consistent with previous cycles where we typically see at least a one quarter lag when the market is transitioning towards the bottom. Based on our visibility today, we're currently expecting a low single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins also drifting modestly lower.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Thanks, Christian, and good morning. I'd like to start by congratulating our Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations teams for delivering solid results in a very difficult market. We are the execution company and our guys are flat out executing right now.","Internationally, we continue to make progress with our mature field strategy. During the quarter, we completed a successful infield drilling program in Malaysia, while mobilizing for projects in Iraq and Russia. In Mexico, we completed drilling the first well using rigs from our joint venture with Trinidad Drilling, setting a new drilling record for South Mexico Mesozoic basin. We're seeing strong interest from our clients tendering new activity, and the global pipeline of opportunities that we're evaluating continues to be in excess of $35 billion.","The deepwater economics were challenged in $100 a barrel and are clearly challenged in the current commodity price environment, which is precisely why we are focused on technology that both delivers better production and reduces the structural cost of drilling wells. This generally means removing complete activities from the work stream. A terrific example of this is how Landmark's DecisionSpace software allows clients to reduce drilling days by integrating geological data with well construction design. In a recent deepwater project, this integration reduced drilling time by 15 days by eliminating one entire directional build phase.","In another case, the President of another large client was quoted at a recent conference saying that his company reduced its seismic survey data analysis time by 80% through working with Landmark. The point is that Landmark is making a meaningful contribution to our strategy to lower the cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our clients by eliminating activities and reducing structural costs, while also delivering more productive wells.","Another example of technology driving efficiency was the delivery of three Lower Tertiary completions in the Gulf of Mexico using our Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone Packer (sic) [FracPac] (22:25) System. The ESTMZ is proving to consistently reduce rig time in these high cost environments.","Turning to North America land, the industry saw a sharp 40% sequential decline in the average rig count during the second quarter. Against this backdrop, let me provide a few data points around Halliburton's operations in the quarter. North America revenue was down 25%. Our stage count was down less than 10%. Average profit per well increased 7% sequentially, and finally, approximately 85% of our active fleet continues to work on a 24-hour-a-day operations. And we believe these factors clearly indicate why operators prefer to work with a more reliable service provider like Halliburton for more complex completions.","So now that the rig count appears to be scraping along a bottom, what happens next? The exact timing's difficult to predict, but the previous cycles would point us to the following progression of how the story should play out as we move forward. First, activity stabilizing means the healing process can begin with respect to pricing and margins. This will then allow our input cost savings to catch up, and our efficiency programs and well solutions can begin driving margins up. Price improvement will then be a challenge until we see capacity tightening in the market. Therefore, any margin improvement will likely be the result of lowering our cost base.","We stacked a nominal amount of equipment during the quarter and expect to put this equipment back to work when the economics justifies doing so. We currently estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of industry capacity has been idled, although our percentage stack is significantly lower.","What's unique about this cycle is how service intensity has evolved since 2013. Over the last two years, average job size has essentially doubled. And at the same time, both average pump rates and pressures are also up. On the plus side, bigger jobs mean more revenues and better equipment utilization for us. The downside is we believe larger completions are taking their toll on pumping equipment. In fact, these factors point to higher equipment attrition rates for the industry.","Now, this is precisely why we continue to invest in our service efficiency strategy at Halliburton. Close to 40% of our pressure pumping fleet has been converted to Frac of the Future, with a target to reach 50% by year-end. Our customers appreciate the reliability and efficiency of our Q10 units, and we are pleased with the progress in updating our fleet with this more cost-effective model.","In addition, the downturn has allowed Halliburton to retool and improve our maintenance and value engineering processes. The result is that in spite of increasing service intensity, our maintenance cost on a per unit basis is trending down, while our service quality and efficiency are the best in company history, differentiating us from our competitors. And while the market has been myopically focused on service pricing, we know that ultimately, it will be lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent that will carry the day. So to this end, in addition to surface efficiency, we continue to deliver technology to help our customers reduce the structural cost of their wells.","For example, the Illusion dissolving frac plug, which we launched in the second quarter, will ultimately eliminate the requirement for coil tubing to mill out plugs. The Illusion frac plug provides high-performance isolation during plug-and-perf operations and functions like a normal plug, meaning it does not require any balls, baffles or any sort of special casing design. When dissolved, it leaves the full wellbore open to maximize production.","And I'm pleased to see the growing customer interest in using technology for better well placement and better perforation efficiency. An example of this is our proprietary FracInsight solution, which gathers the necessary logging data, but does it in a cased-hole environment, meaning it does not consume valuable rig time required by open hole solutions. In a joint study with a large customer in the Eagle Ford, FracInsight data eliminated the pumping of unnecessary out-of-zone treatments, which helped reduce stimulation costs by over 35% and significantly improved the cost per BOE equation for our customer.","Let me spend a minute on refrac technology in the market. We've been involved in refrac operations for decades, and have executed at least twice as many as any other service provider. Although relatively small today, we believe this market has significant potential in the coming years. So why are customers interested? Early horizontal wells were arguably under-stimulated as stages per well are up more than 30% and proppant per well is up more than double since 2010. What's changed is two key components of technology.","First is our diversion chemistry that more effectively stimulates wells, and then second is our diagnostic technology to validate those results. Diversion technology, like Halliburton's AccessFrac, more effectively stimulates the entire lateral through better proppant placement, creates greater complexity within the formation, and helps mitigate well bashing scenarios. Thus far, through our candidate selection process and design, AccessFrac contributes an average of 80% increase in estimated ultimate recovery for our refrac clients, while greatly improving the predictability of results. More importantly, AccessFrac is equally effective as a solution on new wells, improving cluster efficiency and delivering 20% to 25% production increases for our customers compared to offset wells. AccessFrac is becoming a standard process for a growing portion of our clients, and is delivering better production and EURs.","Our suite of fiber-optic diagnostic tools, deployed either as a permanent installation or on coil tubing, allows us to monitor individual stage results and validate the treatment performance of our refrac solutions. This means that we can demonstrate that our diversion technology and equally critical delivery process together dramatically increase stimulated clusters along the lateral, thereby maximizing our customers' production and EUR. Though a relatively small market today, we see significant runway for refrac in the future. There's an opportunity to address the needs of operators to increase their production and expected ultimate recovery from the tens of thousands of unconventional wells drilled over the last several years. And we anticipate that customers will begin to dedicate a percentage of their annual spend to refracturing operations.","Because of our confidence in our technology and ability to lead this market, we've laid the groundwork to execute large-scale refrac operations through alternative business arrangements. To this end, we're pleased to announce that we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with BlackRock to provide a funding mechanism specifically for refrac projects up to $0.5 billion in capital over the next three years. We're pleased to work with a tremendous partner like BlackRock. This arrangement allows Halliburton to focus on candidate selection, execution, and generating best in class returns, while allowing BlackRock to pursue innovative opportunities with their clients.","We've seen it before; our customers in unconventionals are highly adaptable, and they are actively seeking the surface efficiencies, downhole technologies and business arrangements that will make the economics work. When the recovery does come, it's our belief that North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside. And when that happens, we are confident that Halliburton will be the best positioned to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle.","I'd like now to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff. To sum things up, this is a damn tough market, one of the toughest ones that I have ever been through. And I don't believe anyone on the call can accurately predict when commodity prices will rebound and rig counts will recover in the U.S. or the international markets, and neither can I. What I do believe is that when the recovery occurs, North America will offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be the best positioned to lead the way.","We are pleased with the progress of the proposed Baker Hughes acquisition and are working diligently to close this transaction before the end of the year. Looking ahead, whatever shape you think the recovery will take, we have the products, the technology and the management expertise to outperform the market. We have demonstrated this during the previous cycles and have no reason to believe that this cycle will be any different. As we have said, our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable, and we are already seeing that by working together, we can figure out a way to have both of us earn returns for our shareholders even in this challenged commodity market.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, guys.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Good morning.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","It looks like contrary to, I guess, popular belief on Friday, you guys did not have to work all weekend to change what you were going to say today, so congratulations on a good quarter.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, James. Yeah, I had a stress-free weekend, that's for sure.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Good to hear. A quick question on the North American margins. So, the 300 basis points to 400 basis points of extra cost that you're holding on to right now, is that just Halliburton related costs or are you actually adding to your cost structure in anticipation of the Baker Hughes transaction? And if so, will you have all the railcars to handle those facilities, et cetera, that you need once the transaction closes later this year?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Yeah, thanks, James. This is Jeff. The \u2013 I mean, we have the best operating platform in North America. So when we look at that and anticipate adding a second story basically to the house, our management structure, the operating basis that we have, the logistics infrastructure, including things like Battle Red, and our business development we know are critical to delivering the synergies and delivering them quickly. So as we manage our business, we continue to invest in those things that support that sort of in spite of the market. So the answer is managing our investment in new things, but obviously retaining those things that we know are important.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Okay. Okay. Fair enough, Jeff. And another question, a follow-up for me related to that one. On the synergy number for the Baker Hughes proposed transaction, it sounds like you're very confident still in that $2 billion number. However, both companies have taken cost reduction efforts. Is that \u2013 I mean, are you synthetically raising that synergy number then if you're already \u2013 both companies are already going through cost cutting right now?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Yeah, I mean, that's a way to look at it, but I think what's most important to take away is that the \u2013 while market adjustments are required, we want to be crystal clear that the current activities do not impact our view and confidence in the $2 billion worth of post-acquisition synergies.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Indeed, a solid quarter, particularly given the market. I guess to (35:56) look forward into 2016 on the U.S. pressure pumping market and just your thoughts on the outlook, not thinking about oil prices, but just the outlook for scrapping of equipment by some of your peers, maybe laying down equipment that's going to be cannibalized and not returning. When you think about 2016, how do you think the pressure pumping market will play out ignoring the oil price scenario?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Yeah, thanks, Angie. I mean, 2016 looks better than 2015, but I'd like to reframe your question as how really does attrition play out. And for example, I was just out in the Southern region looking up. When I travel, I look at our locations and competitor locations, and I see more equipment than required showing up on competitor locations to compensate for the lack of maintenance and the lack of capital investment. In some cases, two times as much is what would be required. Now, that's attrition in action. And capacity can tighten very quickly, and we saw that in 2014, how quickly attrition \u2013 or actually, capacity tightened. So, I mean, that's why we're so committed to Frac of the Future. I mean, it clearly performs in the downturn and it's even more valuable as the industry recovers.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I was actually kind of surprised on the BlackRock side, the transaction. Can you give us a little detail there, further details on how that will play out, the logistics of the arrangement and just some color?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Well, yeah. I mean, what we see is this is a foundation for growth, and demonstrates our belief that the market grows. And it's clear that the technology enables returns. It also lays the groundwork for us to move quickly at scale. And the short answer is it's set up around a three-year sort of window, I mean, it provides a lot of flexibility for us to act quickly.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Dave, in your prepared comments, you noticed that service pricing is generally unsustainable across all product lines. I was wondering, given the potential for attrition in the industry and given how low pricing is, how do you think \u2013 do think pricing can normalize back up to a more reasonable level before we fully utilize the fleet, given the amount of stacked capacity? Or how do you see that first step in pricing playing out given how depressed pricing is and given how much idle capacity there is? Should it normalize a little bit quicker because there is so much stacked capacity and people are investing in their fleets, or is going to take just as long as it has also prior troughs and up cycles?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think the \u2013 certainly, it's not going to pop back up to where it was even a year ago today. It'll normalize in an incremental fashion, and it's going to be a combination essentially of pricing increases, equalization or equilibrium in terms of equipment across the board, and also allowing the input costs to continue to catch up with where we are. So it's going to be a lot of blocking and tackling, and it's just going to go step-by-step.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is on international pricing. Christian, you noted in your prepared comments that taking into account you have a full quarter of lower pricing rolling through, how should we think about in the fourth quarter, have you already adjusted? Are you already seeing a lot of the new pricing rolling through the P&L? Or are we going to have more of an effect as more contracts reprice in the fourth quarter as well?","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","Jud, the fourth quarter, it's still early to call what the fourth quarter will look like, but if you think about it, we will still continue to have pricing pressure impacting the fourth quarter. However, we would have the usual seasonal uptick that we experienced on the \u2013 during the end of the year.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Is it too early to see if you think those can kind of offset each other by the fourth quarter?","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","At this point, we think that the seasonal uptick will offset the \u2013 any sort of additional pricing impact that we might have in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to drill down a little bit further on BlackRock and also kind of broaden the discussion with regard to business models. So with regard to BlackRock, what are they bringing to you that you can't do on your own? Is it simply balance sheet? And then moreover, what exactly are you sort of purporting to do with regard to pursuing the refracs? Are you underwriting the cost of the refracs? Who are you targeting, et cetera? And then secondly, more broadly speaking, in terms of that \u2013 the evolution of your business model, are you willing to put your balance sheet to work and make use of your robust holistic value proposition with regard to underwriting the cost of drilling and completing a well, even a new well?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Bill, (41:23) questions in there. Let me try to synthesize an answer sort of one at a time. Think about what a service company brings to the table is sort of the people, process and technology. And what we're looking for is sort of revenues and margins today. What a BlackRock brings to the table is they're looking for an income tail that goes out a number of years. So in my view, it sort of dovetails together very nicely. To specifically answer your question, yes, we believe in our technology, we believe in the refrac market going forward, and we believe that we can make a difference. And so we would leverage our balance sheet to ramp that part of the business up. But what BlackRock gives us is an ability to lever beyond that, look at additional ways of doing business with our customers, different business models, push beyond where we have been today or where we might be going in the future. But we're not going to lay those out for you here on the call because I think those discussions are going to be with specific customers in specific circumstances and will remain confidential between us.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. And who are \u2013 what type of customer are you targeting? I mean, it's not, I would assume, just the E&Ps under duress, but who else are we targeting?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we're not targeting marginal assets here. We're targeting good sets of assets that for whatever reasons are not being able to get accessed by our customer base today.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, I want to reiterate great quarter, especially with regard to those international profit margins. I'm curious as to your opinion on when the domestic industry could see some friction in rehiring labor if this recovery gains momentum. I realize that you're in a great position given that you're one of the very few companies that actually has the ability to carry extra labor and extra costs today. So the question for you is really, at what rig count do you think you could see competitors become more aggressive in trying to steal your employees simply because there's a dearth of quality labor on the sidelines?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Yeah, I mean, that's probably less of a rig count question, more of a capacity question as things start to tighten. And I think we've demonstrated through the last cycle, our ability to ramp up very quickly with people. So not particularly concerned about that.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","For the industry, more broadly though, do you think it would happen this cycle at a lower rig count relative to the past, because \u2013 given the service intensity trends?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Well, I think tightness could occur at a lower rig count most certainly, and I think that the lack of investment in the industry today could drive that tightness at a lower rig count.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And do you think the equipment burn rate is going to be an issue before labor or vice versa?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","I think the equipment precedes labor.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Good morning. Just a follow-up to the prior question there. In one of your earlier comments, you mentioned that industry capacity for frac are fully (44:50) 40% or 50% excess at the moment. But when you factor in the (44:56) perspective, the attrition, what would you say the net effective excess capacity in the marketplace might be?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","I think it's \u2013 Kurt, this is Jeff. I mean, it's \u2013 If you think about attrition, it's happening all of the time, but it's not necessarily apparent all of the time. And by that, I mean it's \u2013 you don't see it until there's a call on the equipment, and we really saw this last time. So as competitors consume more equipment on location to do the work, you don't feel the tightness. But as that equipment is called on for even a little bit of incremental activity, that's when it's seen. So recalculating the 50% overhang is difficult to do until there's a call on it, but we're certain that it's happening today.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then for my follow-up, Christian was mentioning some continued pricing pressures or lingering effects of pricing pressures going out into the fourth quarter. Just wondered if you might be able to give us some general sense, are the pricing pressures going to be roughly equivalent in North America and international? I would be under the impression that the pricing elements would have largely abated during the third quarter if rig count's going to stabilize. Just give us some more color on pricing dynamics on a regional basis, that'd be helpful.","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Well, I think pricing internationally, all the customers ask for discounts, but the reality is there's not much to give. We never recovered from the 2008 cycle internationally. And so the better discussion there \u2013 and it moves to this discussion \u2013 is around how to deliver better efficiency and reduce costs, and that leverages precisely what we do at Halliburton. North America, as we've said, we see the price decline rate, maybe a description, decelerating, but nevertheless, still some pressure as we move through the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I guess I'm curious to hear how the last few weeks have impacted the customer discussions, whether it'd be \u2013 I mean, I imagine it's mostly focused on North America, but it did feel like completion activity was finding a floor and then the oil price rug gets pulled out from everyone. So I'm just curious how the \u2013 your view around the third quarter has evolved over the last three weeks.","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Well, over the last three weeks, it hasn't changed that much. I mean, we think about the rig count, it has puts and takes. And so it was seeing some improvement, but then Friday, I suppose those gains were erased. So I would describe where we are today as scraping along a bottom. And scraping along a bottom means that we don't anticipate dramatic change of any sort, certainly over the very near term.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","My follow-up just on the profit pressures in North America. Should we expect Halliburton's North American business in Q3 to stay profitable?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Most certainly.","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","Right. So, obviously, there's still uncertainty on the depth and length of the cycle. However, we are doing everything possible to make sure that our North America will be profitable.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, all.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks. So, a lot of focus on the attrition rate in pumping this call, but how about on the demand side? You mentioned that you're seeing the average job size increase significantly year-over-year. How should we think about sort of the pressure pumping intensity of the rig count? Is there a rule of thumb that we should think about? And how is that changing?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Well, the demand for equipment and the \u2013 the increasing demand on equipment is really a function of the increasing job sizes. And so we see more and more of the capital spend on completions, and I don't see anything that dials that back. Obviously, technology that we deliver is focused on making better wells sort of within the current job sizes. So I don't think job size growth is not infinite because it starts to have an impact on neighboring wells and other things, but the quality of the fracs will continue to improve.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I guess, said another way though, if you think about the job sizes increasing, is there something that we could tie to a rig count? I know the rule of thumb used to be sort of four or five rigs per pressure pumping crew. Is it something lower than that today that you're experiencing in your fleet? Or are the increased efficiencies that you're able to realize offsetting that?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Well, I would think more in terms of well count than rig count today driving completions. And from our perspective, the basis for the Q10 and Frac of the Future is for us to be able to do that, which we are doing with substantially less capital on location. So that's clearly part of our competitive advantage.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I would say just one additional thing is although the rig count has been decimated this year, the rigs that are running today, keep in mind, are the most efficient rigs that are out there. And therefore, they are drilling more wells sort of per rig than we've ever had in the past. So I think the fixation on rig count, yes, it's important to the industry, but I think well count is another thing that folks need to look at and concentrate more on, because it's the well count that ultimately drives how much completion work is done.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. Maybe first question relating to the international activity. There were some references, maybe several references particularly in Europe\/CIS\/Africa, related to product sales. Should we read anything into that? Is it \u2013 was there a bit of catch-up from buyers that weren't buying, say, in the fourth quarter of last year in the downturn? But was there some sort of truing up to a normalized level? And I guess what I'm hinting at is perhaps there's some falloff as guys have caught up a little bit in their product purchases \u2013 as your customers have caught up in their product purchases. Does that undermine the third quarter outlook at all?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think what we're trying to say, service work is fairly consistent and fairly predictable, product sales sort of come lumpy all the time. And so when you get a product sale, it might push your margin and revenues up or down, but I wouldn't \u2013 other than sort of a fourth quarter push around Landmark and things like that, product sales do happen throughout the year. We just like to be transparent and point out when they've helped. But they're going to help nearly every quarter. But it just depends on sort of what the location is, what the geography is and perhaps, in some cases, what the product line is.","Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Unrelated follow-up, maybe it's my \u2013 I'm not that strong in the accounting side and I don't want this to devolve to an accounting lesson, but I was a little surprised to see the stoppage of depreciation without things getting pulled into some sort of a discontinued state as the assets were held for sale. Does that happen or what's the trigger point for the businesses to be pulled out and put into a discontinued state?","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","Right. So, Brad, obviously, don't want just an accounting lesson, but accounting standards...","Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC","Right.","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","...call for a business that planned to be divested to be classified as assets held for sale when they meet certain criteria, and we met those, those are \u2013 there are six conditions. To be reported as a discontinued operation, well, you have to put the results of that business in a separate line item, that business needs to represent a strategic shift by the company, and that's what the accounting standards require. And clearly, this is not the case in this situation because we will continue to be in those businesses for drilling services and drill bits. So our treatment is consistent with other merger situations that require a sale of overlapping businesses.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Rob Mackenzie from IBERIA Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Thank you. A quick question for you. Coming back to the North American margin impact, commenting about 300 basis points, 400 basis points of excess cost you're bearing, I guess I'm a little bit curious with your viewpoint for a muted recovery and uncertainty well into 2016. Why carry so much incremental cost here?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's pretty simple. I mean, I think we have a superior delivery platform in North America. We know where we are going to be adding a tremendous number of people and assets to it, and in my view, it'd be crazy to get rid of it. If you look historically, the cost to carry something ultimately outweighs the cost to have to replace it, go out and get people, retrain those people, rebuild your infrastructure and all of that. So it's a decision I made. It's on me if you disagree with it, but I think that it's easily defendable and I think it's certainly the way we need to go here, and I'd tell you, it's going to pay off once we get this deal done.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Great. Thanks, Dave. And then on the international margin (54:51) this quarter obviously up sequentially, I guess, in every geomarket. I get you're guiding that down slightly again going into Q3. Can you give us a little more color on the Q2 performance? Obviously, some of that was the contract status in Brazil and elsewhere, but it seems like there's a fair bit of cost cutting that went into that, that should carry forward, correct?","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Yes. The \u2013 I mean, the Eastern Hemisphere team and international group's absolutely executing, and executing on the strategy we laid out, which is to manage costs over the near term, and they have done that, taking out quite a bit of costs, while at the same time, looking through the cycle. And we like the contracts that we've won and we've got some very strategic wins that are continuing to go on in places like Scotland and Brazil and other places. So it's just really just execution, world-class execution in the international business.","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","But if I can add to that, in terms of our outlook, our Eastern Hemisphere margins were 19% in the second quarter and we are expecting this to come down a little bit into the upper teens. This would then suggest that our margins are being sustained at a higher level than what they were in the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer","Thanks, Danielle. And I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of comments. First, there's no question that this is a tough market. In markets like this, Halliburton's operational execution becomes an even more valuable source of differentiation, which was demonstrated by our second quarter results. I'm confident that our team will stay dead focused on delivering both best in class service quality, along with our long-term strategies in deepwater, unconventionals and mature fields. Secondly, we're pleased with the progress of the Baker Hughes acquisition on many fronts, including the regulatory process and the divestitures.","We are confident that we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion independent of the current market related actions by either company and are excited about closing the acquisition.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Lance Loeffler Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Lance Loeffler - Vice President, Investor Relations, Halliburton Co.","Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2016 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days.","Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, Acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide commentary on the termination of the Baker Hughes transaction.","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which can be found on our website.","Now I will turn the call over to Dave.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Lance and good morning everyone. Our prepared remarks today will be brief, leaving more time for the question-and-answer period.","We would like to start by providing some background on our mutual decision with Baker Hughes to terminate our merger agreement.","From the time we announced the deal in November 2014, we knew that putting together two companies with the global size and scale of Halliburton and Baker would be no small task. But we believed that we could close the deal and do so in a timely manner because it truly made sense.","We expected the deal would create compelling benefits for the stockholders, customers and other stakeholders of each company. The potential annual cost synergies were substantial and the transaction was expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings within only a couple of years.","In addition, the transaction would have allowed us to further reduce our customers' cost per barrel of oil equivalent. This was truly a great deal. One that was unanimously approved by each company's Board of Directors, and overwhelmingly approved by each companies' shareholders.","Unfortunately, things have changed quite a bit since we signed the merger agreement. From a regulatory perspective, we completely understood that the transaction would draw regulatory scrutiny and that substantial divestitures would be required to obtain regulatory approval.","However, obtaining the U.S. anti-trust approval of large complex business combinations, regardless of the industry, has become increasingly time intensive and difficult, as evidenced by the termination and litigation of several other large proposed transactions over the last 16 months.","We continue to believe the proposed Baker Hughes transaction would have been pro-competitive, that our proposed divestitures were more than sufficient to address any regulatory concerns and that the position taken in the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit and the European Commission statement of objections, are incorrect.","We also continue to believe that the transaction would be good for the industry and customers, particularly now at a time when customers are focused on lowering costs per barrel of oil equivalent. However, the DOJ's lawsuit and EC's statement of objections, combined with the elongated review process in all jurisdictions, created substantial hurdles with respect to timing and deal certainty.","We would also like to correct a misimpression about the proposed divestiture package that may have resulted from the statements made during the DOJ's April press conference regarding the lawsuit.","We proposed to the DOJ, a divestiture package worth billions of dollars that we believe would facilitate the entry of new competition in markets in which products and services are being divested. And we had buyers expressing a strong desire to acquire those businesses.","The proposed divestitures where, for most part, divestitures of complete worldwide product lines including employees, management teams, business development personnel, manufacturing, R&D facilities, intellectual property portfolios, and customer contracts. They addressed most of the markets alleged in the DOJ complaint. We believe that the proposed divestiture package was sufficient to address the DOJ's specific competitive concerns.","In addition to regulatory matters, the unprecedented deterioration of the oil and gas industry decimated the economics of the deal. During the pendency of the deal, the WTI price of oil has gone from over $76 in November of 2014 to a low of just over $26 in February of this year, while the global rig count has gone to a 17 year low and you all know what's happened in North America, where each week we seem to hit new historical lows.","As a consequence, the aggregate quarterly revenues of Baker Hughes have decreased nearly 60% from $6.6 billion for fourth quarter of 2014 to $2.7 billion for first quarter of this year.","Given the abrupt and deep downturn in the oil services market, we were unable to obtain adequate value for the businesses we proposed to divest. This, coupled with the decline in each company's business, eroded the expected synergies and accretive aspects of the transaction, including the timeline to integrate the businesses to levels which we believe severely undermine the originally anticipated synergy benefits of the deal.","As a result, it became clear that continuing to pursue the transaction was no longer in the best interest of our stockholders, despite having to pay the termination fee to Baker Hughes. Moving forward with the transaction did not make sense in light of the elongated regulatory scrutiny, the projected timelines for closing the transaction, the poor deal economics and the current market environment.","Now, to be clear, we recommended this transaction to our board and to our shareholders for approval. We believed trying to do this transaction was worth the risk because of our strong belief in our strategy, process, employees and management team, but it wasn't to be.","There is no doubt we are disappointed and I want to thank both our employees, as well as the employees of Baker Hughes for their tireless efforts throughout the regulatory process.","But you know what? We are Halliburton. And we will continue to provide the same innovative services and products that we've delivered to our customers for more than 97 years.","We have a world-class management team, who has industry knowledge and experience to drive value for our shareholders. Prior to the potential transactions, we were in a strong number two position in the market with a proven successful strategy of gaining market share through outperforming against the rig count and having among the highest margins and returns in the industry.","We were successful in executing that strategy and knew our process was scalable to a larger company. That fact has not changed. If we had been successful, adding the Baker Hughes assets would have given us that scale quickly.","But our strategy has not changed, we still expect to outperform the rig count, we plan to scale up our product service line capability by addressing one product line building block at a time through internal growth, investment and selective acquisitions.","Going forward, we will strive to deliver the same predictable, reliable execution and industry-leading growth, margins and returns from our world-class employees and management team.","Over the past 18 months, despite our intensive efforts to close the Baker Hughes transaction, we have been executing on our key strategic areas and adapting to the new reality that we face in a very difficult market. Compared to where we were a year-and-a-half ago, we have outperformed our peers, both in North America and internationally.","In the first quarter, we addressed some of our access infrastructure costs that we were carrying pending the Baker Hughes transaction. We will now move aggressively to remove the remainder of those costs from our operations over the next couple of quarters.","I am very proud of the outstanding operational and customer focus our employees have kept during this entire process. Their dedication, resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company's strength and why together we can and will weather any challenges that we face.","Now let me turn the call to Christian to provide some financial details.","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced weakening activity levels and pricing concessions during the quarter along with seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea and Russia.","At this point, our overall decremental margins have been less than that of the previous cycle despite this downturn being deeper and longer.","We've provided financial comparisons of our first quarter results to the fourth quarter of 2015 in our April 22nd press release and we would like to refer you to our commentary in that release.","Due to our ongoing restructuring efforts, we've revised our financial reporting presentation to only furnish overall regional results and global division results and we will no longer provide divisional results by region. For Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation segments, we will only provide total global results for each segment going forward.","In the first quarter, we recognized a restructuring charge of $2.1 billion after tax to further adjust our cost structure to market conditions. This charge consisted primarily of asset impairments, including most of our non-Q10 pressure pumping equipment, as well severance costs.","As Dave mentioned, in the coming quarters we will continue to make further structural adjustments including the remaining escalated cost structure we've kept in North America.","Further, in accordance with accounting rules, we no longer classified our assets included in the proposed divestitures as assets held for sale at the end of the first quarter. As a result, in the first quarter, we incurred an after tax charge to recognize the depreciation related to these assets that had been suspended since April of 2015. Beginning in the second quarter, our operational results will include the depreciation expense from these assets.","Our corporate and other expense totaled $46 million for the first quarter excluding costs related to the Baker Hughes transaction. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $50 million to $55 million excluding acquisition-related costs we incurred in April and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the rest of 2016. Our first quarter free cash flow was negative $355 million driven by about $250 million of restructuring payments and acquisition -related costs. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows for the year and given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we've further reduced our capital expenditure plans for 2016 to approximately $850 million.","We've been disciplined in the deployment of capital equipment during this downturn and expect to reduce our CapEx spend by approximately 75% compared to 2014. Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $346 million. For the second quarter, we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $400 billion as a result of recommencing the depreciation for the assets that were previously classified as held for sale, the impact of our multi-year reduction of capital expenditures and the impairments we have taken.","In conjunction with the termination of the Baker Hughes transaction, $2.5 billion of debt that we issued in late 2015 will be mandatorily redeemed. At the end of the first quarter, we had $9.6 billion of cash and equivalents available taking into account the debt redemption plus the $3.5 billion termination fee, we would still have had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We also have $3 billion available under our revolving credit facility which with our cash balance provides us with ample liquidity of $6.6 billion to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market.","For modeling purposes starting in the second quarter we will begin reflecting the incremental interest expense on the debt taking into account the redemption of $2.5 million. As such, our estimated net interest expense for the second quarter will be approximately $165 million and the quarterly run rate interest expense for the second half of 2016 will be approximately $155 million.","Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23%. Our income tax expense for the second quarter will be impacted by several factors including recognition of the incremental interest and higher depreciation, the statutory rates for the various geographies where we expect to generate income or losses, and any discrete tax items. These factors will lead to a high degree of variability on our effective tax rate. Based upon our current forecast and expected earnings mix we anticipate that we will recognize approximately $10 million to $15 million of tax expense in the second quarter.","Turning to our operational outlook, the market dynamics continued to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with our current thoughts on how we see the second quarter shaping up. The following regional guidance comments reflect the higher depreciation expense. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we anticipate second quarter revenues to come in at similar levels as the first quarter, but with margins lower by 300 basis points to 400 basis points due to the impact of ongoing and expected pricing concessions and additional depreciation.","In Latin America, we expect an upper single digit decline in revenues with margins declining by approximately 200 basis points to 300 basis points from the first quarter levels.","In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already down 23% compared to the first quarter average and has continued to deteriorate week after week. As is typical, we expect our sequential revenue decline to outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and anticipate that our decremental margins will be approximately 25% in the second quarter.","Now I'll turn the call to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Thank you Christian and good morning everyone. Before anything else, I'd like to thank each of our employees for their focus on execution in spite of the distractions presented by both the marketplace and current events. We are the execution company.","As we've announced, we're sizing our cost structure to the market conditions we're experiencing. I remain confident that when the market activity stabilizes margins can start on the road to recovery. We've had a dedicated team focused on the Baker transaction which freed the rest of us from distraction and gave us the ability to aggressively pursue our corporate strategy. We've prepared the franchise to deliver industry-leading growth and returns when we exit this down cycle.","Halliburton is the execution company and led our peer group in returns throughout this most recent cycle. Our strategy remains focused on what our customers value most highly. Maximizing production at the lowest cost per BOE.","Clearly, this is a dynamic formula depending on where we are in the cycle. Today, there's no doubt that the numerator, meaning cost, has most of our customers' attention. Cost is something we can control and we do it well at Halliburton and I'm pleased with our progress.","We've consistently delivered the strategy for two components. First, converting customer insight into cost effective solutions and second, by providing reliable service quality. Our capabilities and our execution culture are built around systematically collecting insight from our customers on their operational challenges and collaborating with them and within Halliburton to design the programs and technology to solve their economic and technical challenges.","For example, during the first quarter we delivered production maximizing gravel pack chemistry for a major deepwater customer. However, instead of executing from a costly stimulation vessel, we were able to deliver the job from a substantially lower cost supply vessel by employing modular pumping equipment. The second component, executing reliably on our solutions is something Halliburton does well and our customers appreciate. Our concentration on executing key processes has realized a multiyear double-digit service quality improvement, a demonstration of our clear focus on the lowest cost per BOE in action.","And finally, closing the loop on our performance is where I focus my attention every day. This is execution meaning getting things done. Are we delivering what we promised to our customers? And how do we tighten our unique fit around collaboration, technology and service quality while systematically reducing our cost and capital requirements to deliver the growth and returns we expect.","This is an ongoing effort and recent example of this is our North American restructuring where we removed a layer of management. Now, this has changed our cost profile certainly but also simplified and improved our internal collaboration and execution.","Commodity prices in markets will move up and down, but the one thing about which I am certain, one thing that won't change over time is that the lowest cost per BOE wins. We believe our collaborative approach to converting client insight into cost-effective solutions and our focus on reliable execution will consistently deliver the lowest cost per BOE and allow our customers to make better wells and be more successful over time.","We continue to believe that the longer it takes for the recovery to occur, the sharper the recovery will be. And that North America represents the greatest upside and that Halliburton is positioned to outperform.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff. Let me sum things up. We are disappointed in the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, but we are not going to do a deal that is not economic for our shareholders and we are confident that our focused strategy will allow us to continue to outperform.","Given our market outlook, we made significant changes to the fundamental cost structure of the business which, we believe, will help protect margins in the near term and drive outsize incrementals going forward.","This market has generated a sense of urgency in many of our customers and we are having better conversations with them around improving their cost per barrel economics. And ultimately, we believe that when this market recovers, it will be North America that responds the fastest, offering the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be positioned to outperform.","Now, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, good morning.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A question, maybe for Jeff, maybe circle back a little bit, you touched on it in the opening comments, but the elevated cost structure you were carrying waiting for the Baker acquisition to close, could you maybe talk a little bit more and quantify that the cost cutting opportunities you see, the timing it could take to whittle that down? And I guess also, is some of that included in Christian's guidance for the second quarter margins?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Sure, Jud, thanks. Let me provide you with some color on where we are regarding cost savings. In North America, we've been carrying around 300 basis points of added costs, which we started to dismantle in Q1. Now that process is going to continue through the end of the year and we expect to eliminate 100 basis points per quarter. Now that's just in North America. So we're also looking at doing the same in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as well as in all of our product service lines and corporate structures. So we're scrutinizing every cost, from manufacturing, to supply logistics, to field operations and we're doing this on a global basis.","So, overall, we'll be reducing our structural costs by about 25% or maybe said another way, we'll lower our annual run rate on costs by around $1 billion by the end of the year, but with little of that happening in Q1.","So these structural reductions are on top of volume-related cuts as we continue to adjust our operations for the market. Now, the structural changes, by definition, are stickier. And all this doesn't come without a cost. But looking ahead \u2013 we are thoughtfully looking at how we work, what makes us more effective in the way that we go to market as we make these reductions. And in many ways, we're more effective now than we were before, or at least certainly in terms of safety and service quality.","So for those reasons, the changes we're making, in my view, do not impact our ability to scale in a recovery. And at the same time, positioning Halliburton to outperform through the cycle.","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","And, Jud, this is Christian, it is included in my guidance.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that, I appreciate it. And my follow up is, maybe for Dave, you mentioned it, again, in your comments, you're having discussions with customers on lowering costs, but I'm curious, with commodity prices poking their head up this quarter, are you having any more dialog from your customers on potentially going back to work in the third or fourth quarter? Or are they still taking a more cautious tone towards the back half of the year at this point?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think that clearly they're marginally more optimistic about things. I don't think we've seen that optimism translated into any set plans to actively increase the rigs in the back half of the year, certainly those discussions are taking place. I think if you look at our release we put out last week, we thought the rig count would bottom in Q2, I think we still believe that's the fact.","But certainly, with the oil prices a little higher, people are more optimistic and we do think that potentially we'll see an upswing in the rig count in the back half of the year.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, guys.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, James.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Hey, Dave and Jeff, maybe for you guys, so Baker is done and not going to happen and it is what it is, and you guys have seen my written comments about the DOJ overstepping their bounds here, but you still have some, I guess portfolio gaps, if you will, in production chemistry, artificial lift, how do you think about \u2013 where does Halliburton go now? What's the Halliburton of a year from now, two years from now look like?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, let me handle that, James. I guess before we talk about what we're going to look like going forward, I think it's really important that we really review where we are today. First and foremost, we're an integrated global oil services company, and I think in order to make that claim, you have to have a broad portfolio, offer every service to every customer in every market. And if you are an integrated company, you essentially can't pick and choose where you provide, who you provide it to, where you operate and what customers you work for.","If you look at our individual product lines, our current portfolio is actually pretty good. We're in a number one market position in fracturing, in cementing and completions. Our drill bits is number one in North America. Sperry, Wireline, Baroid and Landmark are all in strong number two positions. And you referenced the ones that we need some help in and certainly the Baker Hughes transaction would have helped in artificial lift and production chemicals. In those areas clearly we're not in any sort of a market-leading position, and I said that in my prepared remarks.","But we have an ability to grow product lines. I think a great example of that is our testing business, where just over the last several years, we've gone from essentially a startup to almost a number two in the market position and with the contracts that we've won, we believe we'll very soon get into a number two position there.","So I like where we are, we certainly have the ability, as I said in my remarks, we are going to invest in those product lines where we're a little bit weak and we'll look at selective acquisitions to round them out. I think as far as then what comes next, from a shareholder standpoint, I want to reiterate, we are continuing to be dead focused on our growth, margin and returns and leading the industry in those areas, get the billion dollars out of the business that Jeff just referenced and then take advantage of the North America rebound when it comes.","So yes, we are disappointed, but we've got a good portfolio, we're going to continue to execute our strategy and we're going to be fine.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Okay, got it thanks, Dave. And then on the North American market, it looks to us at least, and we're fairly bullish on oil prices, that cash flows for your customers will be up next year versus this year and certainly that will go back into the ground in drilling wells and could be a pretty significant recovery. As I understand, there's no translation on the current oil prices to pick up actively now, but are you starting to have conversations, Dave at your level or Jeff at your level, with your clients about their 2017 outlook? And they're going to have, in my view, they're going to have to get back after it or their production is going to go down, but are they starting to have those conversations about a pickup in activity?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, certainly as I said earlier, they're more optimistic because of where prices have gone back to. There's clearly been a re-basing, a re-setting of breakeven points through a combination of, obviously, service costs coming down, and I would argue, coming down to certainly an unsustainable level.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Right.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's going to be an element of balance sheet repair that has to go forward, but clearly, that is going to be offset by what should be some pretty significant production declines that these guys are going to see. And I think given the nature of these companies and they are independents, they're very confident in their own skill set, they're confident in the acreage they have and I think that when they believe that the time is right to start drilling, they will do it. And generally, I think what we've seen is they'll be able to get the money to do that either through commodity prices, or through going back into the equity markets or the debt markets.","So, yeah, they are feeling better and I think they're trying to survive to 2017 and then get on with things.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Got it, thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Clearly, I'll start off by saying, clearly a year-and-a-half ago no one would've expected conditions to deteriorate so severely, so it's very good to see the market react as well as it did and see that the best move for Halliburton was actually pulling away from the deal given the current market conditions.","The question I would have for you, Dave, is we'll go to the bread and butter of the U.S., on the frac side, there's a lot of discussion on the attrition side. And so therefore, I wanted to hear your thoughts, or Jeff, on how much attrition do you think is merely replacing capital goods versus true attrition of equipment that could not come back? And how old you think equipment needs to be before you see it as no longer committed, or the customers see it as no longer actually competitive? And how much of equipment out there is that?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure, Angie. And certainly Jeff and Jim Brown live this every day, so I'll let Jeff handle this one.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Angie, our thoughts are that about half of that equipment is idle today and that idled equipment is not being maintained. We hear companies talking publicly even about cannibalizing equipment that is stacked, and that's equipment that really doesn't go back to work. It gets rained on, it sits there, it's more and more difficult to bring back. So I think that is continuing all of the time.","From our perspective \u2013 actually interestingly enough though, the volumes pump which probably has more impact on equipment continued to increase, so we saw 17% increase in sand volume on a per well basis which says that the equipment has to work harder than it ever has. And so for that reason, we are really happy with our Frac of the Future configuration in the Q10 pumps just because they handle it so well. So, again, I think the equipment is out of the market, much of that equipment is probably out to stay.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","And then do you have any thoughts on the range of horsepower that that would be?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","That's probably, we estimate in the 30% range.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then as a follow up of our discussion here on the DUC thesis, on it potentially or maybe not tightening up the frac market. So any thoughts there on what oil prices you think we would need to see for those to start to be completed? And the timeframe and horsepower needed to complete these extra DUCs in the market?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","I think the DUCs right now are we estimate around 4,800 to 5,000, some of those are seasonal. We don't see volume continuing to build and in fact it's kind of being worked off in the stream of work that's out there today. So I don't see them as impactful, all at one time. We continue to describe them as deferred revenue for us as they get done. As far as price, I think it's more a sentiment than it is a price per se. It needs to be confidence around a price is probably as important as whatever a price may be.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","So then you don't see the completing of these DUCs as a tightening of horsepower? It's not enough to actually make a difference on or a meaningful difference on demand versus supply?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No I don't think so.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So just to continue on that line of thinking a little bit, when we get to a recovery scenario, is there one in which...","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sean, can you turn \u2013 it sounds like you've got your speaker on in the background, so we're getting a double....","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry about that.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Here we go. Okay.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry about that. Thanks. Just on that line of thinking, in a recovery, is there a scenario in which some of your pre-Q10 horsepower goes back to work? Or do we think next cycle effectively your fleet is going to be fully Q10 irrespective of the slope of the recovery?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Our target was to be fully Q10, and I think what we continue to believe that that performance out of the Q10 is differential and so that would be a target. That said, the equipment that we have, our older equipment is still better than what's available in the marketplace. So I'm always comfortable bringing that equipment back to the extent it fills the gap. So I feel like we're very well positioned in terms of responding to the market from an equipment standpoint.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Think you. And then just on the balance sheet side, Christian, you noted the plan to continue to spend within cash flow. Following the breakup fee payment, may be an update on how you're prioritizing cash uses considering the more levered balance sheet that you are going to have?","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","Right. So we estimate that we need somewhere around $1 billion to run the company, so we're carrying more than enough cash, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks. Our use of cash is prioritized, first, with ensuring that we have the resources to take advantage of organic opportunities as they come. Second, the bolt-on acquisitions as well as any sort of ventures that we need to make to execute the strategy, cost per BOE strategy that Jeff laid out. And third would be any excess cash after that will be delivered back to the shareholders through buybacks.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, Fair enough. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks, guys.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dan.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dave, you have a very strong track record of outperforming the rig count in the U.S. in down markets and in up markets, and as we look forward here, the one thing I'd like to get an update on is, your utilization sounds very high on your frac equipment, especially the Q10 pumps, just given what you are experiencing in your completion revenue in U.S. versus what peers are reporting. So in order for you to continue to outperform as the rig count increases, is that going to need to come from price increases? Or do you expect to get further market share gains and on the further market share gains, is that going to require potentially unstacking some of the equipment that you recently impaired?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think. Dan, it's actually a good question, it's one we talk about a lot internally. I think you have to go back to the basic strategy that we follow in North America and that is to be in every basin, to be with the right customers in those basins and have the right relationships with those customers. So there's a number of ways to outperform the rig count when it comes back. And obviously, I won't give a detailed roadmap as to how you do that but, certainly, by being and having the right customers as your bread and butter from a revenue stream, they generally are the ones that are more financially secure. They have the better acreage, and they are the best positioned. They are likely the ones to put the earliest rigs up.","And therefore, it's a natural extension of your market share by you take a customer that we have a great relationship, might be running five rigs today when they go to eight rigs, you automatically get that work. So that's one way.","Second is the efficiency of our equipment. When things bounce back and it will, lowest cost per BOE and efficiency is still going to be very, very important. And having the Q10, having our Frac of the Future, having our footprint, having our logistical system and all of those things in place because we have not and will not dismantle any of that, as part of the exercise Jeff talked about, will still allow us to be the low-cost provider in a market that's expanding.","I think another reason that we have worked hard to keep our utilization up is, it is I don't care what people say, it is going to be harder to crew frac spreads, it's going to be harder to crew cementing equipment and those sorts of things when this thing turns back. And so by keeping and preserving as much of our workforce and as much of our equipment being active, we can basically leverage that workforce more quickly across an expanding rig count.","So I like where we are, it hasn't come without, obviously, a cost. We've worked hard with our customers to make sure that they in a position to keep rigs in the air. That's not, as I said, come without a cost on our margins, but I think it's a good trade-off because when this thing snaps back it's going to snap back hard and I really like the position we're going to be in at that point in time.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And somewhat related, when I look at your CapEx, it's coming down quite a bit this year and it's really running about mid-single-digits at least of my revenue estimate and that's down from low-double-digits in the past. As the cycle snaps back, as you say and we start to get in that recovery mode, will CapEx get back to that level of near double-digit or are we at a structurally lower level?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think at least in the near term we're probably at a structurally lower level. If you look at our release that we put out a week ago, clearly the whole industry is overcapitalized at this point in time, and it's overcapitalized with some really good equipment. So I think that as it flexes back and the rig count comes up, customer start to spend more money, the need to spend on capital, if in fact you are maintaining your equipment, maintaining your tools, which is what we are doing.","We're not cold stacking stuff and letting it deteriorate, it's really just going to be an issue of getting the people to man that equipment as it comes back. So I don't really see us getting back to that level unless the market got really frothy like it did last time. Hey, that would be a great position to be in, I just don't see it at this point though.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. You may begin.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mike.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. A lot of questions on the operation side have been answered. I wanted to just ask a quick one on capital structure. You talked about, Christian, the priorities of use of cash, but how do you think about the mix of debt versus equity right now and into the next couple, three years?","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","So one of the metrics that we use, Mike, is the way we look at our leverage is through \u2013 is the ratio of net debt to net cap, and we expect that ratio which is about 30% to go into the mid-40%s, so it is still very manageable. But you're right, we have to look at ways to delever the balance sheet and we're putting on plans to do that. Now having said that, Mike, and you know this, we are an investment-grade company and even though much like the rest of the industry, we are being reviewed by the credit rating agencies, we fully expect that after the smoke clears that we will remain an investment-grade company. So we will have ample liquidity and the financial flexibility to do whatever we need to do to make sure that we continue to add value to our stakeholders.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, Mike, this is Dave, we'll have an obvious quick decision or quick opportunity to assess things. We have a $600 million debt repayment due in the fall and whether we just pay that off with the excess liquidity we have or look at the total capital structure, that's something that we'll be doing over the summer and into the fall. As Christian said in the call, even after the dust settles, we're going to have over $3.5 billion of cash sitting on the balance sheet. That is actually too much given where we are in the cycle and the fact that it costs us about $1 billion to sort of run the company.","So we actually have that problem sitting in front of us right now, great problem to have. And we'll spend the balance of the second quarter here watching the market. There could be additional acquisition opportunities come up. As Christian said, we would consider buybacks, and any of the whole range of options. So we're in a good position to just sit back right now, make that decision, but clearly capital structure is on the top of our priority list right now","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much guys.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, James.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","By everybody's agreement, North America is going to come back first. In the international sector, I'm just kind of curious how you guys see how long it takes for international to come back, and which markets to come back first?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Thanks, Jim. The international cycles are just longer, and so they are longer on the way down because structurally the contracts are longer, they're also slower on the uptick as well. So, I don't expect to see improvement internationally until we see some improvement in North America. That timeframe has usually been six months to a year in terms of the lag between North America and the rest of the world. I think if we look around the world though, the...","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hang on, hang on \u2013 hey, Jim, just like a couple guys ago, you've got your speaker on in the background, so we're getting an echo I suspect everybody is too.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I will try and fix that. Thank you.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Internationally, it does not have the same overcapitalization that we saw in the U.S., so I think that that will help it react more quickly. As far as markets returning, I think the mature fields part of the business is the first to tighten back up, would start with the better markets like Middle East would be \u2013 it's most resilient but it tightens first. Probably we'd think Asia would be next as we looked around.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate that. And my follow-up if I could, Jeff, you talked a lot about the cost per BOE, and then, Christian, you talked about bolt on acquisitions and possible costs related to Jeff's cost per BOE strategy. What are the capital requirements for the implementation or continuation, Jeff, of your cost per BOE strategy and what products was the capital actually spent on?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Well, capital is spent on the things that drive a lower cost per BOE, and by that I don't mean to be trite, but there are technologies, there are pieces of the business that, in my view, contribute to that. How we work and how we integrate internally is a big part of how we put those things to work. So there will be gaps here and there that say, hey, if we can put that to work in our system to drive a differentially lower cost per BOE, those are the things we want to spend money on.","From an equipment perspective, Q10 is a great example of that. Because it differentially drives a lower cost for us and a lower cost per BOE for the market. So I think you'll see us consistently evaluate things through that lens.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital. You may begin.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Thank you, guys. I had a question, followed up on Baker's call and tying it into what you guys said about this morning, Dave, about weakness, obviously, in artificial lift and production chemicals. Can you foresee a return to Baker perhaps selling those product lines through Halliburton in an integrated type offering?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not going to speculate on that.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Okay. Well, that was my question, thank you. I will turn it back.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Believe me, I've got lawyers shaking their heads at me like crazy right now.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Okay. Well, then \u2013 I guess, my follow-up then would be, how do you see based on Baker's, if you can comment, based on Baker's strategy change, how do you see the competitive dynamic changing in a lot of particularly international markets but also in the U.S., say, pressure pumping market where they seem to be pulling back largely from that business?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think let me just stipulate, I did not listen to Baker's call this morning, so I really don't know what they said. So I can just sort of respond to what we see in the marketplace. I think that pressure pumping, in my view, to be successful at it in the U.S. you have to have the U.S. wide business because so much of the advantage you get in that business is through scope and scale. It's being the biggest procurer of sand, it's having the infrastructure, it's having the rail cars, it's having the transload centers, it's having the ability to spend on technology, on chemistry, on footprint, on downhole capabilities.","And I think pulling back into a limited number of basins just doesn't allow you to have that scope and scale. So our strategy has always been one that you have to be, if you're committed to being an integrated services company, you have to take the benefit and the downside of that. And in a market like this, there is some downside because you are operating in some markets, you are operating in some product lines that maybe are not giving you the kinds of returns that you want.","But at the end of the day when it does bounce back and you're making hay from a margin standpoint, it's way better to be essentially in every basin with every product line, so that's our strategy. As I said, I don't know what was said this morning, but our strategy is to be a full-service company, integrated across our product lines in every place that our customers want us to work.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dave.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Just following on the same line of thinking, bundling of services was a big subject of last few years before the downturn, I'm wondering if anything has changed in your philosophy in North America. Obviously the low-cost operator you talked about, the vertical integration; nobody is going to be more efficient than you guys. Is that still the thought that we're going to lead with the pressure pumping, that efficiency is pulling the rest of this technology and that's where margins come from in North America? Has anything changed with this downturn in that line of thinking?","David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. In fact, I think bundling and the ability to bundle, will be even more important as we come out of this for one simple reason. This thing finally got so bad that our customers had to lay people off, and by basically reducing their G&G capabilities, their engineering capabilities, their exploration capabilities, their drilling departments, they don't have those people internally that maybe were basically not as interested in bundling as they may have been in the last go around. So as this thing turns back up, they are going to be also more stressed from a people standpoint, and the conversations we're having with them today is about the advantages of bundling, from not only an efficiency standpoint, but from a cost standpoint.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So if we just think about your Q10 pumps, obviously you're talking about kind of hydrating your all equipment with all the Q10s. Can you help us understand a little bit on that fleet? I'm not sure how you measure the bundling. I think in the past you've talked about maybe two or three product lines that are pulling through. Can you give us sort of, I don't know, a measurement of where we stand right now on that?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Look, the Q10 is a key component of how we go to market, it drives our cost down most certainly. So we see just more things bundled around the wellhead. There is not as clear a measure around that. I think, it's more we bundle to the degree it drives lower cost for BOE for our clients, and those things become clearer as the activities around the completion start to pile up. And that's clearly an advantage for us because the equipment works together, or people work together and ultimately it does deliver a lower cost per BOE.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. You may begin.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. A quick question on the asset impairments. How many pressure pumping horsepower was that that was impaired?","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","We're not going to provide that level of detail, Marshall, but just to give you a flavor of the restructuring. Of that, C&P was two-thirds of that amount and one-third is D&E. That's probably what the level of detail that we're going to provide.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. It helps. And what happens to that horsepower once it's written down? Is it just scrapped or what do you see happen there?","Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer","Well, the way we've impaired the assets, there's really two buckets. One that is actually written off and therefore we're going to get rid of it. And then there's a portion of the assets that actually are idled, cold-stacked and we did an impairment analysis on that amount. Those are the larger components of our restructuring charge around fixed asset impairments.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. One last just quick one on labor. You all mentioned labor issues, and recrewing these crews. Could you give us a little more color on that because I've been hearing the same thing from different industry sectors. And where do you see the limitations on labor as we ramp back up over the next couple of years?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","This is Jeff, I think we're differentially advantaged there, just because as Dave mentioned, we stay in the market and we keep experienced people, and know how to hire those kinds of people. If we look back just to 2014, we hired 21,000 people at Halliburton during that year, absolute adds. So we do know how to add people to the payroll when we need to. So those people are out there, it's not easy to recruit them, but we certainly know how to recruit them and I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director","Okay. Thanks, Shannon. So I'd like to wrap the call up with just a couple of comments. So first, while we are disappointed about the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, we are excited about the future and our differentiated strategy to maximize production at the lowest cost per BOE for our clients. We are having productive conversation with clients around how we do this in the current marketplace.","Second, we are systematically removing structural costs to address the current market outlook while retaining our ability to rebound quickly when activity turns up. We remain dead focused on revenue growth margins and returns, and clearly believe that Halliburton will be best positioned to outperform when the market recovers.","So thank you, I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Shannon, you can end the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Lance and good morning to everyone. Never before in my nearly 40 years in and around the oil and gas industry have I seen a more difficult year for the industry. The down cycle in the 1980s was bad, but 2016 represented the sharpest and deepest industry decline in history. However, today, I\u2019m really excited about what I see happening.","Now, we came through 2016 in pretty good shape. First, I want to highlight a few of our 2016 accomplishments. We finished the year with total Company revenue of nearly $16 billion and adjusted operating income of $690 million. And once again, we believe we outpaced our primary competitor in growing our market share.","We generated significant cash flow from operating activities during the second half of the year and increased our cash position for the full year. We successfully completed our structural cost initiatives and were able to cut more than a $1 billion in costs out of our business.","Now for some fourth quarter highlights. I believe, we had a fantastic quarter in executing our strategy. First and foremost, I am very pleased to announce that we returned to operating profitability in North America after three quarters of losing money. We achieved incremental margins of 65% in North America, and we continue to clearly gain market share as we outgrew our primary competitor in not only North America, but Latin America and the Eastern Hemisphere.","We gained significant market share throughout the downturn, coming out of it the highest market share in North America that we\u2019ve ever had. And in Q4, we utilized this increased share to drive margin improvement, and I\u2019ll discuss that in a few minutes. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we maintained our margins quarter-over-quarter, despite continued stress on pricing and revenue activity. We achieved over a $1 billion in cash flow from operations in Q4 alone, underlining our commitment to efficient working capital management. On a low light, as a result of the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, our $0.04 per share adjusted operating results did get hit by significant foreign exchange loss of $53 million or $0.06 per share. Now, these results reflect successful execution in a tough environment and position us for the challenges and opportunities ahead.","Now, let me take a few minutes to discuss what we\u2019re seeing in the market today, and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Despite the positive sentiment surrounding North American land, it is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles. While the North America market appears to have rounded the corner and is on the upswing, the international downswing is still playing out.","Let\u2019s talk about North America. On the second quarter call, I told you that customer animal spirits were back in North America. Last quarter, I said that these animal spirits were alive, but somewhat caged up. Now, these animal spirits have broken free and they are running. However, not all customers are running in the same direction or as a pack, but they are running. These animal spirits can be seen by the dramatic increase in customer M&A activity, energy industry initial and secondary company offerings, the significant private equity capital moving into resource plays and of course the increase in the rig count. Customers are excited again, and our conversations have changed from being only about cost control to how we can meet their incremental demand.","As things began to recover in Q3 and Q4, we made a conscious strategic choice to not chase additional market share and erode our profits further. Therefore, our North American revenue did not grow at the same pace as the rig count for the last several quarters. The historically high level of market share we built in the downturn gives us what we call the power of choice in the recovery. This is the ability to work with the most efficient customers who value what we do and who reward us for helping them make better wells. With this power of choice, we continued to execute our strategy of high grading the profitability of our portfolio with customers that value our services.","Let me tell you how that strategy worked. In Q1 and Q2 in a competitive pricing environment, we built the highest market share we ever had in North America, by demonstrating to our customers the benefits of our efficiency and technology and the ability to make better wells. We saw that historical high market share as an advantage and we wanted to utilize it.","In Q3, we told you that we were willing to strategically trade some of that historically high market share for better profitability. Clearly, the time had come to improve returns and that is what we told our customers. In Q4, as demand for our equipment increased and availability tightened, our customer discussions revolved around the unsustainable pricing that was in place and the need for us to make a return before we were willing to continue to work for them or add new equipment. If a customer agreed to better pricing, we continued to work for them, if not, we took that equipment and use it to fill the incremental demand with a customer that shared our view on how to work together and make better wells. These conversations about the need for a healthy, profitable and viable service industry were sometimes hard, but they needed to happen. So in effect, we kept active equipment working at a higher price, while we believe our competition brought equipment into the market to fill that demand at a lower price point. They gained share that we no longer wanted while tying up their equipment at a lower price point in an accelerated market.","By executing the strategy, we intentionally gave up some market share in the short run, but we met our goal of returning to operating profitability in North America. We did this because it\u2019s important to keep in mind that above all, we are a returns focused Company. As we go into Q1, we continue to benefit from increased demand from customers and are now at the point where we are bringing back cold stacked equipment. This newly activated equipment is only being added at a rate that ensures it is profitable. It should also stabilize our market share at above historical levels. This action is a meaningful step in the right direction to maintaining the leading market share while at the same time achieving industry leading returns. Bringing back equipment is not without a cost, and Jeff will talk about this in today\u2019s pricing dynamics in a minute.","So, as I look at 2017 in North America, I really like how it\u2019s shaping up. I expect as we finalize the execution of our strategy that revenue will meet or exceed rig count growth in 2017. However, we will have to contend with the cost of reactivating frac spreads and inflation on our inputs. Keep in mind that our suppliers also expect to benefit from our customers\u2019 animal spirits.","So, let\u2019s turn to the international markets. There pricing and activity levels remain under pressure as we near the bottom of the cycle. Low commodity prices have stressed budgets and impacted economics across the deepwater and mature field markets, which has led to decreased activity and pricing throughout 2016. These headwinds still persist today.","Now, there has been a lot of debate as to what commodity price will reactivate the higher cost basins, such as the deepwater complex. It is clearly higher than the price that we are seeing today. Also impacting the price will be OPEC compliance with its new production guidance. Most people agree that the U.S. is now the world\u2019s swing producer and it has demonstrated its ability to ramp up production quickly at a price that may make it difficult for deepwater projects to compete.","We believe that the race to get deepwater project cost down versus the impact on commodity prices on increasing U.S. shale production will have to play out over the course of 2017. Therefore, we do not expect to see an inflection in the international markets until the latter part of 2017. In the meantime, our international customers remain focused on cash flow, and traditional contracting cycles will likely mute any dramatic rebound coming off the bottom. We expect revenue and margins to slowly grind down during 2017, as the market seeks to stabilize.","Overall, our 2016 results show that we have executed in a challenging market. Guided by the lessons learned from past industry cycles, our strategy focused not only on managing cost but also lining our resources to strengthen our market position, and I think we\u2019ve done that.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff and Mark to cover our operational and financial results. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 2016 certainly was a whale of a tough year. I want to thank each of our employees for their hard work and commitment to execute at every turn and deliver Halliburton\u2019s value proposition. We collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. There has been a lot of change in North America over the last few months. Dave shared with you how we used our market share strategy to regain profitability.","The next step in boosting profitability is increasing prices. So, let me start by talking about where we see pricing. While rumors are circulating in the industry about huge price increases, that\u2019s just not a universal fact. Given our position in North America, no one knows more about pricing than we do, and here is what I do know.","First, I like talking about price increases more than decreases, it\u2019s a nice change. Second, the service price recovery is starting from an extremely low base, in many cases below variable cash costs. Third, the level of pricing that satisfies a particular service company depends on where they are on the profitability continuum. Finally, even though the industry is starting in different profitability levels, every company will have to march back up the same path to profitability.","Turning to downturn, our industry went through a steep regression in profitability as pricing and activity declined. The industry moved from positive operating margins to negative operating margins and into negative EBITDA and ultimately round up struggling to cover variable cash costs. It was a fast and hard road that caused a dramatic shift in landscape of the service industry and wiped out a significant amount of shareholder equity.","The pricing brawl continues as the industry recovers and equipment availability tightens. Pricing at the margin is ultimately set by whoever is satisfied with the lowest returns. It\u2019s important to understand that our competitors\u2019 motivation from margin returns is largely built around where their pricing is anchored today. For example, if they are at negative variable cost, then they\u2019re trying to get to a negative EBITDA. If they\u2019re at negative EBITDA, then they\u2019re trying to get to negative margin and so on. I can tell you, despite what you hear in the market, it\u2019s clearly a bridge too far to skip from negative variable cash to positive operating margin in one step. So, the industry pricing regression I discussed earlier needs to become a pricing progression. This means that for now Halliburton will have to compete with companies that are satisfied with lower levels of short-term profitability. But, we don\u2019t believe their pricing is sustainable. You can\u2019t have negative margins forever.","In the meantime, Halliburton will continue to maintain our focus on execution and service quality as we defend our position without sacrificing price. I believe the superior service quality is a prerequisite to having a meaningful pricing discussion, and our dedication to service quality helps create the profitability results for the quarter. As Dave said, we\u2019re at the point in the cycle where we feel it\u2019s appropriate to bring equipment back into the market. We have a disciplined approach which looks at the required combination of market demand, market share and profitable pricing. Our stacked equipment was the best in the industry when it went on the fence and is the best in the industry as we bring it back.","Our manufacturing and maintenance capabilities provide us many levers to pull from reactivating cold stacked equipment to building new. This competitive advantage allows us to minimize the costs and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers. Our decision to bring equipment back is based on returns. However, there is an associated expense to activate cold stacked equipment. Industry estimates for reactivating spreads very-widely. And while our efficiency and expertise allows to be on the lower end of the scale, it doesn\u2019t make it free. Because we immediately spend some of the costs to reactivate the equipment, it will be a drag on our margins for a few quarters. To give you a rule of thumb, we believe on average, it will cost a penny per share in the quarter we bringing back a given spread. After we absorb the impact of this additional expense, our margins should accelerate towards the end of the year.","Now, turning to the international markets. Latin America had a solid quarter. While the region continues to experience activity and pricing headwinds, we were able to finalize a number of items that have pending throughout the year for which we had deferred profit. We saw uptick in software sales [ph] in Venezuela and Mexico and improved activity in Colombia and Argentina. At the same time, headwinds persist in the larger Latin American markets and until these are alleviated, we do not believe we will see improvement. However, we are committed to the region and believe that oil and gas is a critical element to the region\u2019s broader economic recovery.","The Eastern Hemisphere was similarly strong in the fourth quarter, but pricing pressure and offshore exposure mean that we continue to expect some decline for these reasons in the near term. We expect to see an inflection in the rig count in the latter half of 2017, supported by strengthening activity in the land-based mature fields markets. I\u2019m more excited than I have ever been about how our approach to collaboration and maximizing asset value resonates with our customers and employees. We continue to focus on increasing barrels and decreasing cost for our clients. This focus is being rewarded in tender wins across the globe.","I could go on and on with examples, but I just want to highlight a few right now. In Oman, we\u2019ve recently started work on $0.5 billion production enhancement contract, which will bring our superior technology and expertise to an exciting tight gas market. In India, we were rewarded a five-rig multiyear contract across several product service lines. This win is a direct result of the team\u2019s integrated approach and efficient solutions, designed to execute the work. It\u2019s a great example of how we can collaborate both internally and whether customers to solve challenges and create results.","Landmark had a great quarter and year, our digital solutions including OpenEarth and iEnergy are gain wide acceptance, both our platforms for collaboration that cultivate data sharing, application building, and knowledge discovery. Using our Exploration Insights platform, we started a strategic Basin Mastery project for a customer that will allow comparison of assets across their global portfolio. This will save the customer hundreds of hours of time and millions in financial investments.","Reservoir Insight is a great example of how we can maximize our customers\u2019 asset value. These examples show our value proposition at work and highlight the successes we\u2019ve had this year. In many ways, 2016 was like a barroom brawl where everyone and I mean everyone took a punch. It is 2017 now and a brawl will continue but I like our chances in that fight. Why, because we are focused on adding capacity where it\u2019s required, keeping a lid on fixed costs and doing the best job serving our customers. I really look forward to seeing the year unfold.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks, Jeff. Let\u2019s start with the summary of our adjusted fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third quarter.","Total Company revenue for the quarter was $4 billion and operating income was $276 million, representing a sequential increase of 5% and 115% respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America, the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives and end of the year software and product sales.","Moving to our regional results, North America revenue increased 9% with operating margins improving by approximately 550 basis points. The higher U.S. land rig count drove increased equipment utilization, particularly in our drilling and evaluation product lines. We also saw the impact of our strategy to improve pricing and profitability in our pressure pumping business that Dave described earlier.","Latin America revenue increased by 3% and operating income nearly tripled, primarily driven by increased activity levels in Colombia and Argentina, and year-end software sales and consulting in Venezuela and Mexico.","Turning to Europe, Africa CIS, we saw fourth quarter revenue decline by 9% with the decrease in operating income of 5%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by weather related activity declines in the North Sea and Russia partially offset by improved activity in Egypt and Nigeria.","In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased by 10% with an increase in operating income of 32%. These results were primarily driven by increased software sales and project management services across the region.","Our corporate expense totaled $67 million for the quarter and we anticipate that our corporate expenses will remain in that range for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest expense for the quarter was $137 million, better than our guidance as a function of both higher cash balances and higher money market rates. We expect that this level of net interest expense will remain through the first quarter of 2017. We reported $91 million of other expense for the quarter; this line item was impacted by foreign exchange losses in various countries, primarily due to the strengthening in U.S. dollar. The single largest factor included in our adjusted results was a $53 million or $0.06 per share non-tax deductable impact from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Our ability to hedge our exposure to the Egyptian pound in front of this devaluation was limited due to the illiquid nature of the derivative market and the inordinate economic cost associated with entering into any available derivative contracts.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 34%; the quarterly rate is always a function of the tax rate you expect for the full year and 2016\u2019s rate estimates have been particularly volatile because earnings were so slow. This quarter\u2019s rate was also affected by foreign tax assessment and a new deemed profit jurisdiction, the non-deductible exchange loss in Egypt and our earnings mix as the U.S. begins to recover. For the full year 2016, however, our effective tax rate was 24%. And as we go forward in 2017, we\u2019re expecting the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.","During the fourth quarter, we also incurred impairments and other pretax charges of $169 million, approximately one-third of which was severance-related cost, primarily to headcount reductions in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as we continue to right size our business to the current market. We also recorded $54 million for the net impact of the previously announced settlement of a long-standing class action lawsuit. This amount was recorded in corporate and other in our GAAP results.","Turning to cash flow, we generated $720 million of cash, improving our cash position at year-end of $4 billion. This increase in cash was primarily due to working capital improvements and continued disciplined capital spending. We improved our days sales outstanding in the quarter by 10 days, while our days of inventory dropped by six days.","We continue to believe that we\u2019ve moved into a period of shorter duration cycles. And given the amount of excess capital available in the market, we\u2019re hesitant to build any additional tools or equipment unless that is new technology, built for a specific contract we\u2019ve won or the expansion of market share. Consistent with that strategy, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2016 with the total CapEx spend of approximately $800 million. Our current guidance for 2017 capital expenditures is $1 billion. This CapEx guidance includes reactivating cold stacked pressure pumping equipment and continued conversion of our hydraulic fracturing fleet to Q10 pumps to support our surface efficiency strategy. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.4 billion for 2017. Of our $4 billion in cash, approximately half is offshore. We require about $1 billion to run the business. Given the strength of our cash position and the potential impact of U.S. tax reform, we\u2019re actively evaluating our options and opportunities around uses of cash, which could include accelerating the maturity of debt, funding acquisitions and organic growth projects or shareholder return opportunities.","Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you some comments for the first quarter of 2017. Our international results will be subject to typical weather-related seasonality in the North Sea and Russia, and the roll-off of higher margin year-end software and product sales, which tends to hit Latin America more acutely. This will be exacerbated by the cyclical headwinds that Dave described earlier. Although difficult to predict, at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a little under 10% with margins down several hundred basis points. And in Latin America, we anticipate revenues to increase sequentially by mid to low single-digit percentages with margins retreating to the low single-digits.","As we move into 2017 in North America, we anticipate subject to weather disruptions that our revenue growth will return to perform in line with U.S. rig count, which is already up 14% against the fourth quarter average. Furthermore, we believe our margins will reflect incrementals of 40% to 45% as they absorb the impact of adding additional pressure pumping equipment to the market. There is one last comment I\u2019d like to make in terms of financial reporting going forward. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we\u2019ll start reporting our four geographic regions showing revenue only and we\u2019ll only report operating income by area, which is consistent with our major peer.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?","Dave Lesar","So, let\u2019s sum things up. To what it\u2019s worth, we believe we were one of the winners in the 2016 downturn. Our 2016 results reflect our successful execution in a historically tough environment and provides us with the position of strength for the markets ahead. The North America market share we built in the downturn provided us the power of choice and therefore the ability to drive returns. We strategically gave up market share in the short-run for the sake of regaining profitability, but we fully expect to get it back. We are bringing back cold stacked equipment to satisfy customer demand. This equipment will meet our return hurdles and stabilize our market share above historical levels. Each spread, however, will cost us $0.01 per share in the quarter that we bring it back. The headwinds we faced in the international markets in 2016 still persist, and we do not expect to see a turn until latter part of the year. As a result, we will continue to control our costs. And just like we were the winners in the downturn, I fully expect that we will win the recovery.","Before we open it up for questions, I want to let you know that due to longstanding travel and business commitments, I will not be participating in our first quarter conference call. Jeff will be providing market comments on my behalf.","With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie, your line is open, please check the mute button. Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.","David Anderson","[Technical Difficulty] in terms of your utilization of your logistical network, you\u2019ve mentioned bringing cost structure more variable, at the same time, I just wondered if you consider expanding any part of the chain at this stage?","Dave Lesar","Hey, David, you came on -- we missed the first part of your question.","David Anderson","Okay. Sorry about that Dave. Yes, I was just asking about with increasing profit intensity in the market share gains you\u2019ve talked about, just curious about where you\u2019re in the utilization of your supply chain and kind of your logistical network as you build that out. Can you kind of help us understand kind of where you think you are and whether or not you think you need to expand that?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, Dave. This is Jeff. Look, the logistical infrastructure that we have continues to prove itself extremely valuable. And as the market tightens, it gets utilized even more. We\u2019ve got sand positions -- trans-load type positions in every market; we\u2019ve invested in the logistics, which in my view is the most important part of that supply chain and that\u2019s the part that gets the tightest the quickest. And so, we like where we are. We even completed some activities through the downturn in key markets. So, we actually never backed away from that, and it will be valuable.","David Anderson","Thanks, Jeff. And Dave, maybe a bigger picture question here. I was just kind of curious your take on kind of what the E&Ps are saying now, somewhat publicly. It really continued to downplay or even dismiss the impact of service cost inflation, continue to be adamant the majority of these cost savings have been structural. I was just kind of curious what your take is on this. And if you were in their seat, would you be factoring 5% to 10% increase in cost in the budget or would you be using something higher at this stage?","Dave Lesar","I would be using something higher, number one. Number two, clearly, some of the cost reductions are structural, but I think as the equipment tightens, commodity prices increase that everybody wants availability of equipment when they want it, where they want it and how they want it. I don\u2019t see that there is going to be the ability to -- for the customer to hold prices down. I mean it\u2019s going to be a supply and demand market, it always is; we will work with those customers that want to work with us. And really, the model for us hasn\u2019t changed. Efficiency is way more important than pricing. And those customers that want to work with us to keep our equipment efficient are those that we\u2019re going to work with. And I think that we\u2019ll both be winners in that scenario.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie, your line is open. Please check your mute button.","Angie Sedita","So, this question is really for Dave or Jeff. I thought it was very noteworthy here that you\u2019re reactivating fleets today. And I\u2019d appreciate more color on this decision as you actively way out pricing versus sharing your thought?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, Angie. Look, I mean, the decision to add equipment is really around we see the market tightening. And in our view, the market share strategy works through the downturn, and as we bring equipment back, clearly it\u2019s an economic decision; each time we put the equipment back to work, we expect to remain returns. But we also want to maintain that power of choice which is very important to us as the market recovers. And so, as Dave just said, we really like our customer mix today, and we want to make certain that we can serve those customers. And we see that\u2019s a key component of how we win the recovery.","Angie Sedita","And then, maybe you could talk about the potential or do you see or is there potential for any bottlenecks in the second half of 2017 at the logistics, sand or people, and is there possibility that could lead to an increase in the pace of pricing across the industry?","Jeff Miller","Well, it\u2019s always the same sort of three things. It\u2019s equipment, sand and people that tend to crop up. I\u2019ll take those one at a time though. From an equipment perspective, it\u2019s as much speed the market as it is anything else. And we\u2019re so happy with our manufacturing footprint in Duncan. So, differentially we have that advantage. Sand, again, it\u2019s not the sand volume I believe will be adequate but it\u2019s the logistics. And again, from our perspective, we\u2019re well-positioned there. We\u2019ve maintained that infrastructure and then finally, people. And we were fortunate to keep our experienced people to the degree that we could through the downturn that will pay back as we go into recover mode. And it is easy to forget, but in 2014, we actually hired 21,000 people onto our payroll. So, we have the ability to flex, and so all of those things are being managed today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin. ","James West","Jeff, when you talk about the price -- the frac pricing in North America and your ability to raise pricing or to raise pricing with the customers you want to be working with, I guess a couple of things. One is, is all the price increases that you\u2019ve asked were so far sticking? And then two, if you are -- as you on stacked equipment, are you meeting your full return threshold or is this more of a let\u2019s get in front of the market with some market share to get that return later?","Jeff Miller","Well, James, the pricing is still the fight. I mean it\u2019s not -- what we\u2019ve seen so far is I\u2019d say to start the utilization and efficiency largely got us to where we are, though clearly we have seen some pricing and that\u2019s progress, but we are absolutely not where we want to be. And so, as we look at equipment, we expect better returns. I think it\u2019s important to note that at least in the last 90 days, we are at a place where more work is in fact helpful.","James West","And then, maybe for Mark, just to clarify, I am coming up with on our math about $0.11 of negative currency adjustments for the quarter, so the quarter would be more like $0.15; obviously $0.06 of that from Egypt. And are we correct on that that it all drops to the bottom line, so it would be more like a $0.15 quarter, or I guess you could call it $0.10, if you wanted to say Egypt is the outlier?","Mark McCollum","You\u2019re right to assume generally speaking currency losses, because they are essentially -- we are a dollar denominated Company, aren\u2019t tax affected. It\u2019s not at realizable loss in the countries that they recorded. So, that\u2019s true that they\u2019re not tax affected. However, I don\u2019t know that I would jump to that conclusion. Clearly, the Egyptian pound devaluation was something that was something that was sort of out of the norm. The pounds had been pegged to the dollar, and all of a sudden they decided not to be, it was an immediate 50% reduction in the currency. The other parts of the currency losses though, I would say, we experienced those quarter in and quarter out. And I would say that for the most part, the rest of them are not unusual, depending our function of the strengthening dollar. But if you look back for the last several quarters, we\u2019ve had them as they\u2019re in the numbers and they were a part of how we had guided the Street as well. So, I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily exclude those as being necessarily unusual. And we\u2019ll expect that they will continue as long as the dollar continues to be as strong as it is and continue to strengthen.","James West","Okay. So, about $0.10. Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Jud Bailey","I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary regarding the reactivation of pressure pumping spreads if I could. Jeff or Dave, is there any way to give any color on maybe the magnitude of the reactivations that you are discussing with customers and for the ones you are contemplating, do you incur the costs, primarily in the first quarter or are you in talks about also reactivating equipment in the second quarter and so, does that drag from a cost standpoint continue in the second quarter as well?","Dave Lesar","Jud, we\u2019re not going to answer that; it\u2019s just competitive and it\u2019s a key part of our strategy in terms of how we go to market. I think the color we would give is that what we want to do is be in a position to work with those customers that value our services. And we expect to see the flight to quality that\u2019s pretty consistent in this part of the market. And for that reason, we put the time and the effort in to make it certain that our equipment is best in the business.","Jeff Miller","Okay, understood. I guess another question, even though you are seeing the headwinds from reactivation costs in 1Q, the first quarter guidance is for incrementals of 40% to 45%. Just to make sure I am thinking about it the right way, as you get some of the reactivation headwinds behind you and of course see higher pricing, is it reasonable to anticipate later in the year for some quarters, we should see higher incrementals than that 45%, as you get pricing and the alleviation of the reactivation related headwinds out of the way?","Mark McCollum","Jud, one of the things you need -- we talked about the cost being in Q1, but there will be cost in Q2 as well, because the ability to get all the fleets activated is going to take a little bit of time. We\u2019re not going to be activating all of the cold stacked equipment that we have, but there is some decisions around how much we\u2019re going to make available in the market at this point in time and we\u2019ll make later decisions. And again, we talk about being very flexible in this kind of market, watching how the market behaves, but as Jeff said, we are going to get equipment ready to go; it\u2019s going to cost us something and we\u2019ll probably be doing that through the course of the end of Q2 and then sort of decide where the market is and where we are to address how much further we go.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin.","Bill Herbert","Jeff, back to the pricing narrative here, I am a little bit confused. On the one hand, you state explicitly in the narrative that the sequential improvement is driven by pricing and activity; secondly, your refusal to reactivate equipment without adequate rates of return and yet we\u2019re processing non-trivial reactivations over the first half of this year. So, by implication, pricing is improving, notwithstanding the fact that it might not be of the same magnitude that you\u2019d want it to.","Jeff Miller","Correct. Bill, yes, seeing improvement; our visibility is improvement further into the future as opposed to the other way. And as a result, that\u2019s the case for reactivating equipment. We see places for that equipment to go and make it return, albeit not the returns we would like but certainly a return and getting us on the path to making those kinds of returns.","Bill Herbert","And, notwithstanding the fact that we had a margin strategy in the fourth quarter versus a market share strategy and thus the delta between revenues and rig count, I would suspect that over the course of 2017 and beyond, the fundamental completions intensity versus drilling intensity would probably put an upward bias on your revenue versus rig count. And so at some point, over the course of 2017, the rate of revenue expansion should outstrip the rate of rig count expansion, correct?","Jeff Miller","Yes. That\u2019s a fair analysis. I agree with that.","Bill Herbert","And then last one from me, Mark. I know it\u2019s hard to expound on this at this stage, because of the fluid nature of the subject. But, can you talk a little bit about Halliburton\u2019s tax rate optionality in the event of the fact that the U.S. corporate tax rate is bent lower?","Mark McCollum","I don\u2019t know that I can say much. I mean, I think that one of the things that we think about is in relationship to where cash is, and we our U.S. domiciled Company, it would have a dramatic impact on us, you see particularly during this period of time, when North America is beginning to expand, a drop in the U.S. tax rate would make a difference. From a manufacturing perspective, most of our equipment is manufactured in the U.S., we actually have worked a strategy to move manufacturing around where it was geographically located to serve the markets where it was situated; and so all of that would be helpful. This past year in 2016, if you recall, we have already taken the tax hit to basically, if a situation presented itself that we could bring our cash back to the U.S. in a tax advantage way, we could do that without a significant impact on our results. We watch that very carefully. But we have -- I guess, what I\u2019m telling you is we have tremendous optionality. I think what we\u2019re just going to pay attention to is how is that going to move forward. We\u2019re going to be working with Congress and the Hill. Our tax Senior VP will be going to the Hill in a couple of weeks, and we\u2019ll just -- we\u2019ll continue to try stay tied8 into where things will be moving and to move as quickly as we can to take advantage of whatever present itself.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Ole Slorer","I was quite impressed with the international margins, and you highlighted of course year-end software and product sales, like we always see. But, could you be a little bit more specific on the margin development into the first quarter as well as the revenue numbers that you guided?","Mark McCollum","Well, maybe, when you say more specific, I mean, I think we tried to give guidance by area, right? I think North America revenue should be in line with the rig count; our incrementals should be in that 40% to 45% range. When you look outside of North America, our Eastern Hemisphere which probably benefited more from some of the product -- year-end product sales but also gets hit more by weather-related seasonality; in the Q1, we expect that the revenues will be down a little under 10%, high single-digits. The margins, the impact -- the margins did look great; they\u2019re very strong because of the product sales; they should drop off a couple of hundred basis points in the first quarter. And then, Latin America, even though we had strong software sales of consulting which impacted, and those come at very, very high incremental, we actually think revenues will be up a little bit, but that it will have a marginal impact and they\u2019ll still fall back down to low single-digits.","Ole Slorer","Sorry. And margins in Latin America?","Mark McCollum","Margins will fall back into the low single digits.","Ole Slorer","Low single digits, okay. Yes, I thought that\u2019s the revenue. Okay. And second question would just be on the North American reactivation of pressure pumping. At what point do you believe that you have to add new capacity rather than cold-stacked and relatively intact capacity?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Look, that\u2019s decisions we\u2019ll make as we work through the process and certainly not something we\u2019re going to share today, just from a competitive perspective. But, we do believe that we like where we are now and we like the plan we have in place.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Jim Wicklund","Good morning, guys. And when you all complain about getting too much pricing or note that you\u2019ve gotten enough pricing, that\u2019s the day the world ends. The comments about reactivation costing a penny, was that a penny per spread that you reactivate? Because if I do just math on a 35% tax rate, that\u2019s $10 million to $12 million reactivation cost per spread. Am I doing the math correctly, guys?","Mark McCollum","You\u2019re doing the math correctly.","Jeff Miller","Yes. Maybe, it\u2019s worth a little color on what that is. And so, as we think about penny per spread, we see estimates are all over the place. I actually believe we\u2019re at the lower end of the range in a sense that it is equipment repair but it\u2019s also advanced hiring, it\u2019s logistics that go with each spreads. So, that\u2019s sort of a fully loaded look at reactivation. And we expect to have the best equipment in the marketplace. So, we certainly put the time into that.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. That clarification is helpful. And if I could on the international side, you guys note that the international inflection is probably going to be later in 2017. And, Jeff, I think you said it was onshore that you expected to move up first in mature fields. Where do you guys see sub-Saharan Africa and offshore Brazil, when do we start to see an improvement in deepwater?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think that\u2019s the toughest hand in terms of efficiency. And I would say at this point in time, the commodity price just had to stabilize at a high enough number that makes it as attractive. And I\u2019m just looking at recent headlines but a lot of investment moving to North America; unconventionals that -- where that money had choices. So, I also think that from an inflection timing perspective, the lead time between investment decision drilling activity is long in those markets for a lot of reasons; and every day that we see delay that gets pushed out yet even further. So, we like our position in both of those places and we\u2019ll be ready when it does recover, but I really don\u2019t -- we think it\u2019s further out than -- further out.","Dave Lesar","Yes. Jim, let me give you an anecdote. I was talking to the CEO of one of our IOC customers Friday, obviously not going to say who it was. And he said that there was not a single asset in their portfolio outside the U.S. that competes with their U.S. opportunities right now. And to me that\u2019s a pretty amazing statement to me in terms of really how much further commodity prices have to go up to bring some of these more either highly complicated or longer duration projects to the front of the queue get an FID decision made around them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your may begin.","Scott Gruber","Just a quick question on the reactivation cost, a penny per quarter per spread. Is that quarterly impact including both, OpEx and CapEx framed relative to your earnings power or is that actually what hits the P&L during the quarter?","Mark McCollum","Yes. So, it\u2019s not a penny per quarter per spread, it\u2019s just a penny per spread, and it is just the operating expense impact to cost. As Jeff indicated, it\u2019s more of just the maintenance on the quarter itself; it\u2019s also the recruiting cost and the other activation cost that we are incurring to get that spread ready to go. It does not include the capital cost. And so, as I articulated, our capital forecast for 2017 is right now as I said about $1 billion. And that incremental that we\u2019re looking at between 2016 and 2017 is a fairly good estimate of some of the activation costs that will be incurred on the capital side to get some of that equipment ready to go, including retrofitting some of our old equipment with Q10s as we get them ready to get back in the market.","Dave Lesar","I think here is a simple way to think about it. We bring a spread back this quarter, the negative impact on our earnings is $0.01; in the second quarter that spread starts to earn revenue and will give us the incremental margins and incremental revenue for that spread. So the penny is a one quarter impact. But clearly, we will be likely to be bringing some spreads back in Q2. So, the impact of those spreads in Q2 will be a penny per share, which is why I made the comment earlier that it\u2019s really going to be toward the end of the year. Once we\u2019ve absorbed the frontend cost of these spreads coming on where we really expect to see our stimulation and pumping margins pop-up.","Scott Gruber","And then a question on sand delivery. Jeff, have you seen any degradation to the percentage of jobs that you are supplying sand for in the marketplace?","Jeff Miller","No, not necessarily. We continue to deliver sand and most of the jobs where we work that\u2019s -- assurity of supply such an important piece of our own efficiency model that we make certain that we control those variables when we go to work and we found it to be very effective.","Scott Gruber","And so, today, when you talk about putting fleets back to work at a profit, one, is that an operating profit; and two, does it include the logistics cost and investment?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean that\u2019s -- when we think about making an economic decision about putting a spread to work and making returns, it\u2019s a fully loaded operating income returns for the Company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. You may begin.","Sean Meakim","I was hoping to elaborate on the logistical challenges we discussed earlier, specifically from the E&P perspective. Are there any pinch points to focus on beyond labor and proppant that could create some challenges, as we move up the cycle here; just I am thinking about things like water and electricity? Some of these emerging plays like the Delaware, it seems like that could be an issue for E&Ps and just curious how you are partnering with your customers try to work through those issues.","Jeff Miller","Look, I mean, essential to our value proposition is how we collaborate engineered solutions to maximize asset value and a key component of that is collaboration around all of those things that help our customers be successful. I don\u2019t see those necessarily as issues that can\u2019t be overcome by any means, water and electricity or things that our customers are very good at managing. And so, I think we\u2019ll find solutions to those.","Sean Meakim","And then, just a follow-up on the reactivations, could you give us a sense of the mix today for Q10s and maybe how that could progress through this year, given the CapEx budget that you laid out?","Jeff Miller","So, about 60% of our overall fleet that\u2019s out there today that\u2019s Q10s. So, as we reactivate crews coming in, we are going to be placing an emphasis on Q10 fleets including that we talked about retrofitting some old equipment, they need pump replacement, we are going to retrofit with Q10 pumps on that equipment. And so, our hope is that as this new equipment comes out, it will continue to increase the total percentage of Q10 fleets in the market.","Dave Lesar","Yes. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Q10 technology. I think it\u2019s delivering the efficiency and the differential, capital efficiency that we\u2019d expected when we brought those out. So, we are certainly incentivized to make those the growing part of our fleet. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. You may begin.","Kurt Hallead","A question for Dave; you bring up some very interesting points in your earlier commentary; and given your history now in the business and through the cycles, I was wondering if you can share your perspectives on the number of different companies in the frac space that are going to be coming public. On one hand, you can probably make an argument that it\u2019s positive because at the end of the day when you go public, you\u2019ve got to be as profitable as you can be, but on the other hand as you go public, I\u2019m sure shareholders are going to expect some sort of growth, which means more capital being deployed into the business and this excess capacity factor may be dampening the prospect for profit improvement. So, I am curious as to your perspective on that, Dave. How are you guys thinking about it and what\u2019d be a good way for people like us outside the industry to think about that?","Dave Lesar","I think I guess the way I think about it is in a couple of ways. One is, you\u2019ve got some sort of brand names and I won\u2019t say who, who are actually exiting the pressure pumping business. So, they have looked at the space and have decided that they don\u2019t want to be in it for now or don\u2019t want to be in it at all, while at the same time, you clearly have a wave of companies that are really just pumping companies only coming into the public market. And you absolutely put your finger on it. I think by being public, there is an expectation that you have profit and that you get paid for growth. And so, what they hear from their shareholders, and I suspect to some extent, most of their shareholders are on this call listening, and it really is going to be the message that they get from those shareholders as to what\u2019s more important, growth or profitability. In our case, because of our position, we think we can have it both; we\u2019re not a afraid of competition; we\u2019ve had a lot of competition come into the market over the past many years. We like our position there; we like our customers that we have.","So, at the end of the day, we\u2019ll compete with whatever is out there with whatever message their shareholders are getting. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s about providing a good service to a customer at the right price. And I absolutely love where we\u2019re positioned, if that\u2019s going to be the state of play, and it is.","Kurt Hallead","And follow-up, maybe for you Dave too; your comment before was pretty intriguing about your conversation with an IOC executive and how they are thinking about their portfolio. Would you say that that is -- could you kind of extrapolate that and say that the vast majority of the IOCs that you talk to have that same mindset? And I would just try to put it into a context that the largest IOC in the world placed a $6.5 billion bet on the Permian, last week. So, I think that does speak a lot for their view of where their opportunity set is. So, any incremental perspectives on that?","Dave Lesar","No, I think each company is different; their portfolio is different; when they acquire those assets are different; how long their production sharing contracts in many cases have to go. So, I wouldn\u2019t generalize the comment to the broader industry. I just thought it was in an interesting anecdotal point from a particular customer. But, you\u2019re absolutely right, even the largest of the IOCs clearly have a focus on the unconventional in the U.S. And I think that bodes well, not only for our position in North America, but the future of the industry here.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thank you, Shannon. So, before we finish, I\u2019d like to emphasize two points. First, our strategy to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value, meaning deliver the lowest costs per BOE is built on Halliburton\u2019s competitive advantage and is well aligned with our customers and is winning contracts and follow-on work. Second, our focus on fairway customers who best utilize our approach to delivering the lowest cost per BOE and our ability to flex quickly with the market, place Halliburton in a fantastic position to win the recovery. We\u2019ll look forward to talking with you next quarter. Shannon, you may now close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Abu Zeya. Please go ahead, sir.","Abu Zeya","Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO.","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events.

These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

I\u2019m pleased with the way the Halliburton team executed our value proposition, delivered exceptional safety and service quality and stayed focused on generating healthy returns and strong free cash flow. I thank our outstanding Halliburton employees for their hard work and execution the entire year.","2020 opens a new decade and a new century for Halliburton. It brings new opportunities that I will address in a few minutes. But first, some headlines for the full-year and fourth quarter of 2019.","We finished 2019 with total Company revenue of $22 billion and adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion. I'm pleased with the continued recovery in our international business. We increased revenue 10%, outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row. North America revenue declined 18% as a result of customer activity and pricing reductions and our decision to focus on those customers that provide the best returns. Systematically improving our service delivery, immediate cost reductions and the growth in non-frac product lines allowed us to stem the margin erosion. We delivered over $900 million of free cash flow for the full year, demonstrating our ability to generate consistent free cash flow, throughout different business environments.","Finally, 2019 was an exceptional year for our safety and service quality performance. Our total recordable incident rate and nonproductive time, both improved by over 20%, historical bests across our business. This is a result of our employees\u2019 continued commitment to safety and process execution.","And now, a few points about the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total Company revenue of $5.2 billion, a 6% sequential decrease and adjusted operating income of $546 million, an increase of 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 13% sequentially and operating margin remained essentially flat. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter. We grew revenue 4% and improved operating margin 300 basis points sequentially. D&E international margins grew significantly, offset by margin decline in North America. While our North America business declined due to the significantly lower activity in U.S. land, internationally, we delivered 10% revenue growth this quarter. This underscores the versatility and global reach of our business. In the fourth quarter, we took a $2.2 billion, largely non-cash impairment charge and made strategic decisions to market for sale our pipeline services and well control product lines.","As I mentioned, 2020 brings plenty of opportunities. The oil price is more constructive as we enter the year. The imminent global recession fears have abated with the help of economic easing from the leading central banks. U.S. production growth is slowing because of constricted capital flows. The increase in non-U.S. non-OPEC supply coming into the market is limited. The geopolitical instability in the key oil-producing regions of the world should add an incremental risk premium to the commodity prices in the near term. That said, oil prices are still supported by the OPEC plus cuts and will fluctuate based on the group\u2019s resolve to continue limiting production.","Gas prices in the U.S. are below breakeven levels. U.S. drilling and completions activity may be biased lower due to the consolidation and restricted access to capital. Halliburton is no stranger to navigating choppy waters. We entered 2020 and our next century with a clear sense of purpose. We will continue to do what we do best, collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize our customers\u2019 asset value while generating industry-leading returns and sustainable cash flow for our shareholders. We will do this with attention to the sustainability of our business, minimizing environmental impacts and acting as a responsible corporate citizen.","The international markets presented plenty of growth opportunities in 2019. We grew revenue 10% year-over-year, closing stronger than anticipated. All regions increased revenue, led by Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe. Both our divisions meaningfully contributed to the international growth, Completion and Production led the charge with 13% expansion due to higher activity in mature fields in Europe and unconventionals in Argentina, the UAE and Australia. Drilling and Evaluation grew international revenues 8% as we increased activity levels in all markets, specifically in Norway, Mexico, China, and Nigeria.","In 2020, we expect the international spend by our customers to increase by mid single digits, making it the third consecutive year of spending growth. We have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete and win across the international markets. We expect to grow at or above the market rate this year, consistently focusing on profitable growth and improving our international margins. Continued gas activity expansion in the Middle East, resolution of political issues in Latin America, and several pending project awards may enable us to outgrow the market again in 2020.","Our Drilling and Evaluation division is poised to grow faster as we get the benefit of the full year in our Norway integrated contracts, the iCruise directional drilling platform rollout continues, and new offshore drilling activity starts up around the world.","The international revenue growth should follow the historical cyclicality. In the first quarter, we expect international revenue to decline due to normal seasonality and the elimination of yearend sales. Thereafter, we should see steady growth that would peak in the fourth quarter. This year, we expect to increase our international margins. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the North Sea and Asia Pacific.","Our project pipeline is strong, and the incremental activity will help tighten tool availability and absorb the existing cost structure. We intend to be prudent with capital allocation, driving our organization to have the right pricing discussions with customers. Given the tool tightness in some product lines and geographies, we're strategically reallocating assets to the best returning opportunities.","Pricing in certain international regions is improving and we expect this momentum to continue throughout 2020. About one-third of our book of business is awarded every year. The remaining two thirds are existing contracts and contract extensions. We are gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, and we're making strategic choices about the work we pursue. I believe the capital and pricing discipline across all geographies will allow Halliburton to deliver rational returns-driven growth in the international markets.","Turning to North America. The U.S. shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn with both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production. As expected in the fourth quarter, customer activity declined across all basins in North America land, affecting both, our drilling and completions businesses. The rig count in U.S. land contracted 11% sequentially and completed stages had the largest drop we have seen in recent history.","While holidays and weather were the usual factors, other reasons for this air pocket in activity included our customers\u2019 free cash flow generation commitments and an oversupply of gas market. With this backdrop, Halliburton followed our playbook and continued to proactively manage our fleet count. As announced last quarter, we also proactively cut costs and started the implementation of the strategy to sustainably improve our service delivery. Those actions allowed us to curb margin declines in North America and deliver lower decrementals year-on-year, even though the industry\u2019s sequential activity drop was much more severe than in the fourth quarter of 2018.","In the fourth quarter, the market saw clear public evidence of the long-awaited equipment attrition. This is just the beginning. We believe a lot more equipment will exit the market as lower demand, increasing service intensity and insufficient returns take their toll. As service companies cannibalize idle equipment for parts and new sideline pumps to beef up working fleets, the available horsepower supply in the market may be smaller than something.","Halliburton has continued doing what we said we were doing, stacking equipment to improve our returns. We exited 2019 with 22% less available fracturing horsepower. We have rationalized our equipment supply to the anticipated level of demand in 2020. The size and scale of our business in North America gave us the ability to right size without sacrificing our market leadership position and the value that comes with it. In the fourth quarter, we started the implementation of our $300 million annualized cost savings and service delivery improvement strategy. We moved quickly to execute the initial personnel reductions and real estate rationalization all with an eye to improving our near-term financial performance.","We\u2019ve achieved about $200 million in savings on a run rate basis in the fourth quarter. While this impacts our business globally, the majority of the savings are geared towards North America. We're looking at 2020 with pragmatism. Early indications are that are U.S. land customers will reduce capital spending approximately 10% from 2019 levels. I believe that the current level of ducks in the market will allow operators to spend less money on new well construction and direct more of it to completions. Depressed gas pricing is negatively affecting the activity outlook in the gassy basins, which will likely bear brunt of the activity reductions in 2020.","In the first quarter operators will reload their budgets, and we expect modest improvement in completions activity as a result. That said, the calendar cadence where some operators are biased to spend more-earlier in the year, will likely remain. Halliburton will continue to be proactive in taking actions to generate industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow in this environment. Here are the more significant actions. After systematically rationalizing equipment in 2019 to adjust to changing activity levels, in 2020, we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall fleet. This should also allow us to be efficient about our workforce and maintenance planning and to achieve higher utilization of existing fleets throughout the year.","Pricing pressure was considerable during the year-end tendering season. Consistent with our capital discipline approach, we've taken on contracts that are expected to allow our portfolio to earn acceptable returns and declined those that are not. I like the slice of the market that we\u2019re choosing to participate in this year.","Our high-graded customer portfolio gives us confidence in a more sustainable demand level and the mix of pricing and volume that generates returns for Halliburton. Make no mistake, we will continue developing technologies whose value accrues to Halliburton and not just to our customers. Our integrated completions offering and the iCruise rotary steerable system are prime examples of such technologies. They should allow us to reduce our capital outlay and deliver better margins, all with the purpose of generating strong returns.","We plan to continue strategically growing our share of services per well, by increasing the competitiveness of our non-hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. Our wireline and perforating, artificial lift and specialty chemical product lines, all posted strong double-digit revenue growth in 2019, despite the overall market softness in U.S. land. We intend to keep this momentum and spread it to other services.","Finally, we will continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy. Halliburton is redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services in order to lower our unit costs and improve margins and returns in the long run. 2019 closed the decade of the shale revolution that transformed the United States into the world's top hydrocarbon producer. Halliburton was an early participant in this development and has been investing in it and innovating ever since hand-in-hand with our customers. As unconventionals enter maturation phase, Halliburton is committed to the North American market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in the new environment.","I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then, I will return to discuss digitalization, a topic that will define the next decade for our industry. Lance?","Lance Loeffler","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results, compared to the third quarter of 2019.","Total Company revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion, a decrease of 6% and adjusted operating income was $546 million, an increase of 2%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized $2.2 billion of pretax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted largely of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment. They also included approximately a $100 million of cash costs, primarily related to severance. As a result of the charge, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a benefit of approximately $35 million from a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, which reflects two months of DD&A impact. The after-tax impact of this reduction in the fourth quarter is approximately $0.03 of EPS, of which $0.02 is included in our Completion and Production results and the remainder in Drilling and Evaluation numbers. As Jeff mentioned, we've also accomplished a significant portion of our intended annualized cost reductions with the remainder to come in the first quarter.","Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.1 billion, while operating income was $387 million, both decreased 13%. Reduced activity and pricing in multiple product service lines, primarily associated with stimulation services in North America land, coupled with lower activity for stimulation services in Latin America and well intervention services in the Middle East drove our results. These declines were partially offset by higher pressure pumping activity in the Eastern hemisphere, coupled with year-end completion tool sales globally.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4%, while operating income was $224 million, an increase of 49%. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in all product service lines in the Middle East\/Asia, coupled with higher drilling activity in Europe\/Africa\/CIS, and yearend software sales globally. These improvements were partially offset by lower drilling activity in North America and reduced testing activity in Latin America.","Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $2.3 billion, a 21% decrease. This decline was mainly due to lower activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with pressure pumping and well construction. This decline was partially offset by higher yearend completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, revenue was $598 million, a 2% decrease, resulting primarily from lower activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina coupled with decreased testing activity across the region. These results were partially offset by higher activity for all product service lines in Colombia, increased project management activity and cloud infrastructure installations in Mexico and higher yearend completion tool sales across the region.","Turning to Europe\/Africa\/CIS. Revenue was $883 million, a 6% increase, resulting primarily from increased well construction activity in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in multiple product service lines in Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower pipeline services across the region. In Middle East\/Asia, revenue was $1.4 billion, a 19% increase sequentially, largely resulting from increased activity in multiple product service lines across the Middle East, India and China, higher pressure pumping activity in Australasia and higher year-end incompletion tool sales across the region. These results were partially offset by lower well intervention services in the Middle East.","In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million, and we expect it to be the same in the first quarter of 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and should remain approximately the same for the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 22%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2020 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 21% with a projected full-year tax rate of approximately 23%. We earned approximately $1.2 billion of cash from operations during the fourth quarter. As expected, we improved our working capital and generated strong free cash flow of approximately $827 million for the quarter, delivering approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year, excluding the cash impact of the restructuring charges I discussed earlier. As a result, we ended the year with $2.3 billion in cash.","Capital expenditures during the quarter were $340 million with our 2019 full year CapEx ending just above $1.5 billion. As we look ahead to this year, we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by approximately 20% to $1.2 billion. We believe this level of spend will still allow us to invest in our anticipated international growth while continuing to rationalize our business to the current market conditions in North America. Within this reduced CapEx budget, we will continue investing in and growing our production group businesses, namely constructing a chemical manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia and expanding our artificial lift footprint. We will also move forward with the iCruise system global rollout, but at a more normalized pace than what we accomplished over the last couple of years.","Our digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating costs will also get an appropriate share of spend. We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors, regardless of the market environment. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end sales, which will mostly impact our international business.","North America will see a modest increase in completions activity, as Jeff described earlier. We will continue to pull the levers that allow us to mitigate margin declines across the business this quarter. As such, in our Completion and Production division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4% with margins declining 125 to 150 basis points. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue will decline 4% to 6% with margins decreasing 200 to 250 basis points.","I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Lance.","One of the key trends that will define the new decade in our industry is digitalization. The next 10 years will see digital technologies and artificial intelligence going mainstream, just like the smartphones did in the last second. In the oil and gas industry, digitalization unlocks the potential to structurally lower cost, shorten the time to first oil, increase optionality in exploration and production, and enhance performance across the entire value chain.","Digital is not a separate strategy at Halliburton, rather it is an integral part of our value proposition. Our ability to collaborate engineered solutions and maximize customers\u2019 asset value is evolving through the seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations. Digital permeates everything we do and has the same goal as our business strategy, deliver value for our customers and returns for our shareholders.","At Halliburton, we are hard at work on the next frontier solutions that will shift the balance in the people, process, technology triad by replacing labor and reducing capital investments through automation and self learning processes. We believe this will allow us to harness the transformative power of digitalization and make a quantum leap in productivity, similar to going from horses to horsepower.","It takes time to build the scalable software and hardware infrastructure required to fully capitalize on digital solutions. We're well along that path and have been building up our digital capabilities for a number of years with the long-term view of how digitalization will evolve. I'm pleased with the internal and customer adoption we\u2019re seeing.","Halliburton is in a unique position to reap the benefits of the industry's move towards digitalization. Our Landmark product line is an established leader in petrotechnical software with the powerful cloud-enabled DecisionSpace 365 software platform. In 2019, the cloud-native software was our fastest growing business within Landmark, increasing revenues 50% year-over-year.","Landmark provides us with solid foundation, established through decades of investment in software development, people, domain expertise and processes to create and scale digital solutions. This benefits all of our product lines. In addition, we have strategic partnerships with Accenture, Microsoft, AWS and Schneider Electric, all of which validate and expand both our vision and our capabilities.","We now have over 100 customers with thousands of users across the globe, leveraging our iEnergy digital ecosystem to integrated software and workflows across their organizations, regardless if they're Halliburton's, third-party or internally developed. This open architecture platform is unique in the industry and in our view is a necessary condition for the successful adoption and scaling of digital solutions. True to our D&A, we are also bringing to market practical, smart and interconnected products and services that help unlock value for us and our customers. We are pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding, well construction and reservoir recovery. Let me spend a few minutes on each.","First, we transformed subsurface understanding using big data, digital frameworks and evergreen models. We've created a unique geological model of the entire earth to provide insights into the origin and productivity of reservoir. Once drilling starts, we deliver improved field measurements with next-generation wireline and logging-while-drilling tools, fiber and sensors. We then translate these measurements into faster and more informed decision-making using a new class of models made possible by digital technologies. For example, our EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity sensor automatically feeds into our industry first, scalable earth model that updates in real time. Customers can now make faster decisions about their development programs and reduce cycle times by a factor of 10.","Second, we improve well construction through collaborative well engineering and drilling automation. Landmark\u2019s digital well program enables seamless collaboration between operators and service companies across a multitude of software platforms. The iCruise drilling system increases the number of built-in sensors by a factor of 5 and offers self guiding capabilities. Working with our rig partners, our digital twin technology delivers better collaboration and faster decision-making. All of these solutions boost efficiencies and lower costs, while demanning the process of well construction.","Last but not least, we improved recovery and production by using our digitally enabled tools to connect customers\u2019 assets and leveraging this to monitor and enhance performance outcomes. In completions, we use our intelligent completions for monitoring production trends and connecting them to broader reservoir management studies. In artificial lift, we leveraged digital to monitor ESP health and extend run life. In simulation, we use our industry-leading fracture modeling software and full-scale asset simulator to model fracture propagation and frac hits. These are examples of how we deliver digital innovation today, with a focus on specific domains and aligned with the customers\u2019 buying behavior. They provide immediate value to customers, increased customer loyalty and generate returns for Halliburton. Over time, we believe digitalization will seamlessly connect subsurface, drilling and production, enabling customers to make asset-level decisions at the speed of execution. We have a solid foundation, the tools, the open architecture and the domain expertise to successfully deliver this vision.","Let me summarize what we\u2019ve talked about today. In 2020, Halliburton is focused on delivering margin expansion, industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow. In our view, international growth will continue. Increased activity, disciplined capital allocation, pricing improvements and our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services we believe will lead to international margin expansion in 2020.","As North America customer spending declines again this year, Halliburton will continue to execute our playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. We plan to provide the service capacity that we believe will maximize the returns on our overall fleet, continue to invest in technologies that improve margins, keep strategically growing our non-hydraulic fracturing product service line and continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy. We believe digitalization will define this decade in our industry. Halliburton continues to move full steam ahead on the digital journey and is uniquely positioned to reap its benefits.","And now, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","James West","So, Jeff, towards the end of your prepared comments, you've talked a lot about international and international margin progression. I wonder, if we could dig into a little more detail there with mid single digit it sounds like growth, you may be able to outpace that a touch here as well, plus you're seeing some pockets of pricing strength. How should we think about the margin expansion as we go through the year, what type of incremental should we be expecting? ","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, James. Look, I think I spent a fair amount of time on the catalysts themselves, obviously activity improving, rational project choices and technologies. I think, the key is, it's going to be shaped -- we're starting at a higher point going into Q1 than we certainly did last year. And then, I would expect the shape of that to look similar where we start and it moves up a little, just that shape of the international margins should stay consistent, but obviously starting from a higher point.","James West","And then, maybe for Lance here on the free cash flow next year, looks like it's going to be pretty significant based on some growth but also lower CapEx here. How should we think about when we're going to see the free cash flow start to show up, will it be similar to this year, or it should be backend loaded, or would it be more even throughout the year?","Lance Loeffler","Yes. Look, I think you're right in terms of the expectations to grow free cash flow this year. You're right around the -- I don't think that the -- our ability to drive sort of the working capital consumption is going to remain in the first half of the year like it has historically for us. I expect some of the extreme volatility that we saw last year to not repeat this year, but there still is a consumption of cash from a working capital perspective. But overall with the reduction in CapEx, the improvement around margins and some stability around our working capital, we expect free cash flow to grow in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Sean Meakim","So, you touched on the margin progression internationally. Can you maybe just talk about how that translates into D&E in 2020? So, we had the margin ramp in 4Q, maybe 70 basis points or so comes from the D&E benefit that will help year-on-year in \u201820. But, can we see 2020 margins on a full-year basis get back to 2017, 2018 levels? Do we think we can get back to a double digit type of outcome for the year? I\u2019m just curious how you think investors will get comfortable with the trajectory like that, just given it\u2019s been a difficult business to forecast last couple of years?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Sean, it has been difficult to forecast, but we've done a lot of things during that time. So, the platform around iCruise technology and EarthStar has been rolling out at the same time. We're seeing a lot of international choppiness that we see some recovery sort of happening, which obviously lends itself towards D&E. And so, I think these are multi-year efforts that we -- and we view them that way. I\u2019d say digital as well will contribute to probably early days to D&E. For all of those reasons, I don't think it's unreasonable also to expect that we get back to I think 2018 looking kind of number or beyond.","Sean Meakim","Got it, okay. Thank you for that. And then, so on the digital strategy, competitors made a lot more noise about their strategy maybe than you have so far. But the [indiscernible] contracts sound pretty similar in terms of the offering. Could you maybe just expand a little bit in terms of the scalability that you see for those types of avenues maybe across a broader set of customers and where you see the most opportunity?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I think I tried to describe today our vision around digital and then the mechanics for realizing that vision, which then quickly becomes in today's market what are the things we actually do. So, I used an example of some of the tools that are in the market. As we integrate those, obviously the moat expands around those. So, I think, it will take many forms over time. Again, it will be big projects, which we\u2019ve talked about a few of those where it's either a cloud infrastructure and the cloud environment that we either install or operate and we\u2019ve got examples of each of those. But equally important will be the day in, day out march around how this work really gets done, which is around drilling, production and reservoir filling in those spaces with tools, they all contribute to that vision. And so, I think that there is a lot of scalability here.","And I think what's most important is really the production capital that Halliburton has invested in Landmark that really makes it scalable. In fact, to do these things at scale, there's a lot of discipline and practice and agile DevOps that are required at scale to reliably develop software and then operate, maintain and then ultimately continue to advance. And we have that. So, and I\u2019m really confident in how that rolled out over the longer term. And I think the thing to focus on is, what are those tools that we\u2019re doing now that deliver returns. Obviously, they contribute to the vision.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Angie Sedita","So, just on C&P specific to North America, could you talk a little bit about the cost cutting that's unwinding here? You said you have a $100 million left. Is there more that could be done beyond that $100 million? It\u2019s for Jeff or Lance. And then, maybe you could talk also about the pricing. Have you seen the market starting to stabilize on the frac side for pricing, are you still seeing pressure in frac and across the other product lines?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, Angie. Look, the $300 million in savings, and we've moved quickly on that. And I think, the $200 million that we've taken out on an annualized basis already, expect to get the rest of that done in Q1. And I think that really speaks to how that team in North America executes. And we execute very quickly and with a lot of purpose. And so, obviously that contributes.","Beyond that, we've talked about our playbook and how we expect to execute our strategy in North America. And I think over time that continues to drive improvement in margins, less concentrated in a moment, but obviously a set of activities that yield value over time. From a pricing standpoint, it\u2019s still very -- it\u2019s competitive information. Obviously, Q4 was quite competitive. And so, I think the market in spite of attrition is still oversupplied. What's important though is that we make our own choices around how to maximize fleet profitability. And by virtue of doing that, I view it as more stable in that respect.","Lance Loeffler","Angie, I might add a comment too on the $300 million in cost savings. Just to be clear too to add to Jeff, that's sort of cash structural savings.","Jeff Miller","Yes.","Angie Sedita","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, maybe staying along the themes on pricing. It's obviously the reverse internationally. Maybe you could talk a little bit or give more color on the pricing power or momentum you\u2019re seeing in the international markets. Is it fairly widespread, is it by specific regions or product lines, and do you think there could be a little bit of momentum going into 2020, or is it slow and steady?","Jeff Miller","Look, I'd more describe it as slow and steady, Angie. I think, what the key is that the setup is constructive. And so, managing capital in a more prudent way, focusing on profitable growth as opposed to growth, all of those things conspire to create an environment, where we're able to get better pricing. Is it widespread, I'd say it\u2019s generally widespread, but there is probably pockets who are more concentrated than others, sometimes driven by availability and complexity of work and things that would normally and rationally drive our pricing. And so, I think that's what we're seeing in the market. And yes, it is getting traction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open.","Bill Herbert","Thank you. Good morning. Lance, you talked about it conceptually, but I'd like to kind of refine it, if you will, with regard to the discussion of the evolution of working capital for this year, less pronounced seasonal trends, you were a huge consumer, cash, working capital was in the first half of 2019 a nice contributor to cash in the second half. I'm trying to kind of peg the order of magnitude of the reduction in cash consumption during the first half of this year versus the first half of last year.","Lance Loeffler","Yes. I think, what you see, Bill is sort of a year-over-year comparison as we don't have -- I mean, last year we were carrying a lot of inventory associated with the boost in the iCruise rollout and in some of our C&P product lines that I don't think that you see that consumption taking place again this year, as we consume more of that inventory, as opposed to build it. The collection cycle is still going to be very similar. Albeit as the international business becomes a bigger part of our business that typically has longer DSOs, so we may see some impact there. But still a view where we build receivables early in the year and then unwind those as we get into the later part of the year.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And so, just to take a stab at it, would you expect that your cash consumption from working capital in the first half of this year would run it like half of what it did in 2019? I mean, is that a reasonable starting point?","Lance Loeffler","I think that's probably a reasonable starting point.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And then, secondly, again a lot of moving parts, but it's kind of a 20% reduction in CapEx, you should have better working capital improvement for this year. Net income should be up as well. So, at least from my numbers, I'm getting to kind of a free cash flow yield, assuming a $24 stock price of kind of 7% to 8%, which is getting pretty sporty. And I'm just curious with regards to priorities of the deployment of that surplus cash flow. Is it still a reduction of net debt first and foremost?","Lance Loeffler","Yes, I think it is. I think with the excess cash, I think we do have a near-term priority on reducing debt. The reality is Bill is while we're focused on that debt reduction in the near term, what it does and what it offers us as we continue to chip away at it, is give us more flexibility to return cash to shareholders in the future. And I think today, our business, we need to address the $3.8 billion of debt that we have coming due over the next six years. So, I think we'll do that -- do some of that in the near-term, but also with an eye on ultimately returning cash to shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Scott Gruber","Kind of staying on a similar line of questioning. Lance, you mentioned the $1.2 billion of CapEx in 2020, which is good to see. Could you just provide some color on how you think about the sustainability of CapEx around that level? There is a few moving pieces year-on-year in '20 and there will be a few more in '21 in particular with the Saudi chem. supplying investment now recurring. But, just how should we think about kind of broad strokes on that level of CapEx and feel free to frame it as a percent of sales, if it\u2019s easy?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Scott, this is Jeff. I think, the key is around prioritization. And we are focused on the best returning opportunities. But, we were able to fund international growth in 2019 and expect with that level of CapEx can continue to fund the growth that we see in 2020. So, it isn't that we are starving anything. The reality is we're feeding things appropriately and around our return expectations. We think about spending this year, it's probably two thirds international, a third U.S. but in our view very sustainable. And so, we're comfortable with that level of CapEx and also what it means to making better returns.","Lance Loeffler","Yes. I would add, in an environment, an increasing pricing environment that generates the appropriate returns, we may spend more, but it will be commensurate with the focus on returns and overall driving better free cash flow.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And then, just a question, circling back on the domestic frac market. With pricing hopefully stabilizing here in early 2020, and Jeff you had mentioned a focus on maximizing returns on the frac fleet. But, broad strokes, does that strategy likely mean that your frac business trends with the market in 2020 or they had lagged the market to a degree in 2020, would be focused on returns? How should we think about it?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I think that it will -- yes, I would expect we stay consistent with the market, but we don't feel like we have to just because we mostly focus on the returns and free cash flow out of that business. But, I wouldn't think we would be out of the market at any point in time. But that said, we\u2019re focused on the slice of customers that make the best returns for us, which gets to a number of factors, efficiency, but also calendar cadence piece of spend. This year going into Q1 for example, we\u2019re 95% committed on the fleet, which is the best we've been since the downturn.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Anderson","Hi. Good morning. Jeff, going back to your comments on the digital side, as we move beyond the proof of concept and it becomes more broadly accepted, you kind of talked about sort of two different types of customers out there, I guess as sort of maybe on the E&P side as those who have kind of realized, they can do themselves and you provide certain discrete operations, different applications like you just mentioned on some of your tools. On the other side, you have other bigger broader customers which you can implement your ecosystem across the organization kind of the announcements you made today. How do you see those two sets of customers evolving over the next let say, next several years? Is it fair to assume just kind of the former and then the former is the majority of that business and then hopefully it kind of evolves more into more the broader implementation? Can you just talk about how you see the customers\u2019 acceptance?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Look, I think customers do this at the pace at which they can digest it realistically. And that is the reason why I think you see that bifurcation today, it's more apparent just because customers that can actually operate and execute at that level of integration are fewer and far between today. And I kind of view it that way. It gets implemented at the pace it could be absorbed. That\u2019s why I tend to talk about the vision and then bring it down to -- okay, here are the more digestible groupings being drilling, production and reservoir, and then even down into the tools. Because the reality is number of these tool don\u2019t have to be integrated but they can be and they are more effective when integrated. And so, if I use a fairly simple example, like in EarthStar tool, it\u2019s a tool, it\u2019s metal, it runs in the well, it\u2019s fantastic tool, but what's most important about it is the answer product, which is the 3D inversion. And now, that 3D inversion becomes even more valuable when integrated in an Earth model and likely yet again more valuable when integrated into the entire ecosphere. But that\u2019s difficult for everyone to do that at one time and it's very hard to do that given sort of the proliferation of different systems. So, the key in my view is we continue to advance the platform, the ecosystem as you described it, while at the same time, driving immediate returns around these tools. And they're available to be integrated into that ecosystem. I hope that's helpful.","David Anderson","That makes, a lot of sense, Jeff. Thanks. Now, the other side of digital here is that it appears to be deflationary to traditional oilfield services going forward. Your customers can do more with less. Would you agree with that? And do you think that future digital revenue to Halliburton, presumably it comes at higher margins, it\u2019s more sustainable, can that more than offset this deflation over the next several years?","Jeff Miller","I think it can, because I think what's missing in this deflation discussion is the moat that comes in around our equipment, that allows so much cost savings on the client side part of the business that we\u2019ll be able to reap better margins and better returns on those assets to deliver those solution. And obviously, at the same time, we\u2019ll likely be reducing our own costs as we work through this. So, I think it will be deflationary in some ways but I think the value and the returns on the not just the componentry but how that componentry is part of that ecosphere really winds the moat that may be isn't there, is prevalent today, but I think we will see that widen and that ultimately drives better returns for us, in spite of what might be deflationary in a number of other areas of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey. Good morning. I guess, I want to come back to the CapEx question and ask it maybe a different way. If we think about that $1.2 billion of CapEx, what's the split between D&E and C&P?","Lance Loeffler","Yes. Chase, this is Lance. I would say that, it\u2019s very similar to the 60-40 split that we talked about between NAM and international is a good proxy.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. So, 60% C&P, is that what you're saying?","Lance Loeffler","No, no, no. 60% D&E.","Chase Mulvehill","Got it. Okay. All right. If you\u2019re 40%, I think that puts you sub 4% of C&P revenues if we think about CapEx as a percentage of revenues. Obviously, lower than kind of what you did in 2016 as a percentage of revenues. If we look over the next couple of years and kind of call it a sluggish, modest growth North America environment, how should we think about C&P CapEx over the next couple years and maybe frame it on a percentage of revenues?","Lance Loeffler","Yes. Look, I think structurally lower, as we described it, based more on the market and the opportunity set that we see. But, we are really careful not to -- we don't peg this to percents of revenues and others things because then when get sort of odd answers when we see markets growing, and I don't think growth is geared that way to our CapEx necessarily. And so, we will continue to focus on the best returning opportunities where we see those. But, the idea that it's going to have to move -- the CapEx is going to move as percentage with revenues is really not -- that's not how we approach that.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. That makes sense. And then, coming back to frac, you talked about 22% less frac horsepower. Is that the amount that you've actually retired? Is that the amount that you've actually taken out of the market from an active fleet reduction? And then, a quick one follow-up to that. You talked about improvement in frac utilization in 2020 for your active fleets. Do you care to kind of quantify that? How much improvement in utilization across your active fleets you think you can get in 2020?","Jeff Miller","Look, I'll start with the first question. The 22% that we described is out of the market sold by the pound retired. But that\u2019s done some good things for us. I mean, the reality is that we're 90% Q10s at this point, our costs are lower, our service quality is the best it's ever been. So, that's how we view that. The activity, I guess, is -- as we look out at the balance of the year or in terms of utilization, part of maximizing profitability of that fleet and the returns on that fleet is keeping it busy. And as I described earlier we started the year 95% committed, which is the best we\u2019ve been in sometimes. So I'm encouraged by that outlook based on the fleet that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead","I was kind of curious first and foremost on the international front, when we look at 2020. Where do you think the best relative growth prospects are for Halliburton? You mentioned that Asia Pac was a major contributor here in \u201819. So just kind of curious on how you see the regional dynamics play out for 2020?","Jeff Miller","Look, I think it's again led by Asia Pac. In 2020 Europe\/CIS continues to be strong as we get into a full year of activity on a number of the contracts we talked about in the past. Africa grows but it will be a bit more-choppy, as it works through exploration and regulatory sort of resetting in that market. Middle East remains robust, but obviously starts at a fairly high point as the market itself, and LatAm likely brings up the rear.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. I appreciate that dynamic. And then, I just want to get a little bit better understanding here on just the guidance you provided for first quarter on the margin progressions for C&P and D&E. And I want to try to get in this context. For C&P, when you look at the margin degradation on a quarter-on-quarter basis, could you give us some general sense of how much is that related to the absence of the tool sales versus market dynamics?","Lance Loeffler","Yes. Kurt, this is Lance. Yes. It\u2019s definitely impacted by just a non-recurring nature of year-end product sales in the C&P division, which were probably up 10% to 15% versus what we saw in 2018. So, we had a good fourth quarter at our C&P division in terms of year-end equipment sales. ","Kurt Hallead","Okay. And then, can the same be said for D&E?","Lance Loeffler","I'm sorry? ","Kurt Hallead","I'll let you continue, Lance. Sorry.","Lance Loeffler","No. And then -- and that is obviously, those margins are accretive. So, what we see replacing that in the first quarter in terms of activity, largely in the resumption of our pressure pumping business in North America is coming at lower margins. And so, you see offset of that.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. Can the same be said for D&E?","Lance Loeffler","Yes, same can be said for D&E, probably more comparative, flattish year-over-year in terms of year-end product sales in our D&E division.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. ","Marc Bianchi","Jeff, you were talking about oversupply still in the frac market, and with your retirements and what we've heard from the others, there has been pretty significant reduction so far. What do you think is needed from here to kind of balance the market and what do you think the timeline is for that?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Look, I think, what's most important is that that attrition is real. I get this question a lot. And I think a quarter ago, I said -- I thought it was 20%, which was viewed as high, turns out that's right in the fairway. So, that attrition is in fact occurring. And the market forces or the forces that drove that attrition haven't changed at all in terms of amount of sand pumps, number of stages per day. All of those things that drive that attrition haven't changed. And so, I suspect we continue on a pace that\u2019s at least consistent with that. As far as the timeline of when we see it, it happens at some point. It doesn't change the way we go to the market today. And so, we are so focused on delivering our strategy around cost reduction and our service delivery improvement that when that happens it will be terrific and we will see a great boost from that. I think in the meantime, we\u2019ve got a plan to deliver solid free cash flows and return sort of in any market.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe someone related, we\u2019ve got the guidance here for first quarter for C&P margins, which includes the full benefit of all the cost cutting you are doing. Where do you think those margins can get absent any kind of pricing recovery for the frac side of business? Is there -- just through the self-help I think you\u2019re talking about a bogey that you would point to, over the next number of quarters?","Jeff Miller","Look, no, I mean, I think we\u2019ve provided guidance on Q1. I view strategy as something that we executed and we continue to see the value and benefit from. And so, we\u2019re taking a very long view of this business and the actions that we\u2019re taking beyond Q1 to continue to contribute and improve the business. And I think that we will continue to outperform, like we have the highest margins today in North America and we will continue to add to that.","Operator","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Miller for closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Liz. Before we wrap up, I\u2019d like to close with a few points. First, I expect that Halliburton\u2019s international growth will continue in 2020, and that the combination of capital discipline, pricing improvements and technology will lead to margin expansion. Second, Halliburton will continue executing our North America playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. And finally, I believe digitalization will define the next decade, and Halliburton is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Youngblood, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are: Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development. ","I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's view about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing the first quarter results which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. ","During the quarter, we recorded a $300 million charge, which amounts to $190 million after tax or $0.20 per diluted share for estimated loss contingencies related to the Macondo well incident. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of this charge on our financial results. As always, we will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Dave?","David J. Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. I'm very pleased to report the following results that were achieved in the first quarter. Total revenue of $6.9 billion and operating income of $1.3 billion represents growth over the first quarter of 2011 of 30% and 63%, respectively, which I believe demonstrates how well we have executed against our targeted investment strategies. These are very strong results, especially considering the industry disruptions in North America related to rig movements and the harsh weather we experienced in the Eastern Hemisphere in Q1. Despite these challenges, we achieved record revenue during the first quarter in our North America region. Globally, both our cementing and Baroid product lines achieved record revenues in the first quarter, with cementing also setting a record for operating income. ","Looking at the North America results for the first quarter. Our revenue grew sequentially by 1% compared to a U.S. rig count decline of 1%. Now while 1% seems small, it's actually the net impact of a significant rig shift that is taking place in the U.S. between natural gas and oil. And operating income was down sequentially by 5%, driven by the inefficiencies associated with equipment relocations, cost inflation and certain pricing pressures in certain basins. ","Last quarter, we spoke in detail about the disruptions resulting from rig movements between basins. Depressed natural gas prices have accelerated the shift from natural gas to oil plays during the quarter. In the U.S., the natural gas rig count declined 151 rigs or 19% just since the beginning of the year. And that slightly outpaced the oil-directed rig count increase of 125 rigs or 10% over the same period. So while the total rig count only declined 1%, the shift from natural gas to oil was dramatic and disruptive to operations. ","In our fourth quarter call, we talked about 8 frac fleets moving from primarily natural gas plays to liquids plays. We now have an additional 5 fleets that have moved or are in the process of moving this quarter. Due to the stability of oil prices, oils in the liquid-rich plays are generating higher returns for our customers. This shift is very positive for us as completing these wells requires higher levels of service intensity due to the advanced fluid and completion technologies, which creates an additional opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from our competition. While these moves are beneficial to us in the long run, they do not come without a short-term impact on our margins. With spot natural gas prices down approximately 50% from this time last year due to the resiliency of natural gas productions in a very mild winter, so at the current prices, we expect to see further declines in the natural gas rig count until we begin to see a meaningful decrease in production levels. Over time, we believe any future weakness in natural gas rig count will be offset by an increase in oil and liquids-rich activity, resulting in an overall yearly percentage increase in the U.S. rig count in the mid-single-digits. ","Also on our last call, we provided our outlook for North America margins for the first quarter. Our revenue was strong this quarter due to better-than-expected activity levels. But our margins were just below our expectations, given that the drop-off in natural gas rig count was more pronounced than we anticipated. Continued significant cost inflation also negatively impacted our margins. As a reminder, there is often a delay between vendor price increases and when we are able to pass these increases to our customers. In the natural gas basins, in particular, this is becoming more difficult and we are working with our vendors for price relief. However, this will take time and may continue to impact margins throughout the remainder of 2012. ","As we renew contracts and win new work, we expect to see frac pricing become more challenging, but the impact will vary by basin. The dry natural gas basins will be the most challenged, followed by those more easily accessible oily basins that are located close to natural gas basins, such as the Eagle Ford. We expect pricing pressure in some of these markets in the near term but believe that these pressures will decline over the remainder of the year. On the other hand, our other product service lines continue to have relatively stable pricing. ","I would like to review some of the key differentiators that I believe make us unique and should continue to enable us to outperform our competition in North America. First, I want to recognize our supply chain organization, whose efforts over the past few years have positioned us well for the current industry challenges. In the 2009 downturn, when many of our peers halted new investment, we recognized the structural changes that were incurring in the North American market. We continued to manufacture new equipment, build logistical infrastructure and develop strong relationships with key suppliers and lock in critical supply agreements. In some cases, we actually provided funding to assist our suppliers with their own internal expansion needs so they could meet our supply requirements. Our leading market position and long-term commitment to North America have helped us secure supplies for key commodities in a very tight market, which has enabled us to minimize supply and logistical disruptions to our customers. The shift of rigs from natural gas to oil has amplified supply chain issues for the industry. We recognize that we are not immune to these challenges. However, we believe our supply chain organization gives us a distinct advantage that should allow us to effectively outperform our competition in 2012. ","To make our logistics process more efficient, we have been constructing transloading facilities in key basins that transfer materials directly from railcars to truck or storage. This reduces our overall transportation to merge costs and improves our efficiencies and allows us to better serve our customers. We strongly believe we will continue to be able to provide our customers with the proppants, guar and other materials they require to be successful as they expand their activities toward oil. I do not believe that many of our competitors can make this statement. In particular, guar, which is a thickening agent used in certain fracturing treatments, is expected to be in scarce supply this year. And although we believe we have secured enough supply for our customers, there have been significant cost increases in guar which are negatively impacting our margins. We are currently working to recover this increased guar cost from our customers. To give you some idea of the magnitude of this increase, the guar gel system cost alone can now represent more than 30% of the total frac price to our customer in certain basins. Additionally, we expect to see some vendor price relief in the second half of the year on our proppant costs. ","Also customer relationships and mix are very important differentiators. Over the past few years, we have carefully aligned ourselves with operators that are running large-scale operations and whose focus is on reliability and value and not just price. We believe we have successfully proven that our superior service quality, reliability and efficiency make us the preferred service company. Price competition today is most pronounced in the transactional market, which we have and will continue to generally avoid. We acknowledge that we are not immune to pricing pressures either. But as contracts renew, we believe we will continue to get superior margins due to our customer mix. ","In addition, a high percentage of our crews provide 24\/7 operations. This is a win-win scenario for us and our customers. Our customers recognize our ability to provide them with a manufacturing-type efficiency model, which ultimately reduces their overall completion cost. This generally enables us to obtain superior margins compared to our peers. Through this efficiency and incremental capacity, we are now able to provide services to customers that we could not get to in the past, and I believe will actually result in a market share increase without us having to discount price on a relative basis. ","And lastly, we continue to expand our capabilities and drive efficiency through technology and redesign of our operations. Our Frac of the Future initiative is a perfect example of how we are staying one step ahead of the competition. We have just rolled out our first series of Q10 pumps, which we believe are the most efficient and lowest-maintenance pumps in the industry. We are also deploying smartphone technology to automate many of the tasks that are now performed manually in the industry today, which we believe will improve efficiency, reduce our operating costs and reduce working capital requirements. We are also working to optimize crew size and centralize functions to be more cost-efficient. As we have highlighted in the past and will continue to highlight, these and other strategic costs have an immediate negative impact on our earnings. However, they are a future investment in continuing to differentiate ourselves in the market. ","Turning to the Gulf of Mexico. We remain optimistic about the recovery of activity and believe that margins will continue to increase as our customers adapt to new regulations and industry efficiency improves. The increase in permit approval should lead to additional deepwater rigs arriving throughout 2012. Our first quarter margins in the Gulf were lower than the prior quarter due to a different mix between drilling and completion-related revenue activities, mainly driven by customer delays of certain completions, an area where we hold the highest market share. We are very optimistic about the future work we see in the Gulf and we have secured additional directional drilling, drilling fluids, wireline and completion work on a number of the new deepwater rigs coming into the Gulf and some of the rigs that are going back to work in the next few quarters. ","So to summarize North America, we believe increased activity of our customers due to the strong liquids prices, access to capital and increase in service intensity are supportive of a healthy market for us in 2012. However, we expect continued short-term inefficiencies and, therefore, downward pressure on margins in the near term due to the shift in our equipment, commodity price mix and pricing pressure and the spring breakup in Canada. We currently expect these transitory disruptions to decrease the second half of 2012. ","Also to be noted, I believe the growing scope of our Canadian business is underestimated due to the size of our U.S. business. I'm pleased to say that Canada is expected to deliver a $1 billion revenue stream for us this year and is a good contributor to our North American profitability. Therefore, we expect to be impacted by the spring breakup in this year's second quarter in Canada more than we have been in the past. So although 2012 will be challenging for North America, I believe it will just be another opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from our peers and continue to drive our strategy of superior growth, margins and returns. ","Now turning to our international results. They were basically in line with our previously stated expectations. We are very optimistic about our Latin America business this year. Latin America posted solid results for the first quarter, taking into consideration the typical first quarter impact of lower consulting and software sales as compared to the fourth quarter. We continue to see shale development opportunities evolving. We are excited about leveraging our expertise in unconventional resources to help our customers unlock the potential of these plays. ","We delivered great production results on our Remolino field lab in Mexico, and Tim will cover that in a few minutes. Based on tendered prices that we have seen, we also believe that we are well positioned to win significant incremental work on the recent bids for Brazil in wireline, directional drilling and testing. As a result, we expect to incur mobilization costs in the second half of 2012 that will temporarily impact Latin American profitability. Brazil was the largest contributor to our operating income increase over the first quarter of 2011 in Latin America and we expect it to continue to grow rapidly. ","Our strategy in the Eastern Hemisphere is also playing out as expected, as is evident by our revenue growth in excess of the rig count growth. Eastern Hemisphere revenue was up 14% from the first quarter of 2011. We continue to make progress in markets that had been negatively impacting our results and are optimistic about activity levels expanding into the second half of 2012. For instance, in East Africa, we continue to see activity levels increase. While startup costs had a negative impact on margins in 2011, we are now seeing our deepwater investment strategy begin to pay off in this important growth market. We also took action the last few quarters to improve our profitability in our operations in the U.K. Our efforts are now paying off there. Despite weather-related seasonality, we saw stronger operational results and are now generating healthy margins in that market. ","In Iraq, we continue to run 5 rigs and expect to add additional rigs and workover rigs in 2012, enabling us to improve our profitability as activity levels increase. Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the future of our Iraq operations and are pleased to be getting the past issues behind us. In Libya, production is also coming back online. However, we are still awaiting well-defined operational plans from our customers. We do not expect to approach pre-2011 activity levels in Libya until late 2012 or 2013. So our view of the international markets has not changed at all. We anticipate international pricing will continue to remain competitive, particular in regard to larger projects being tendered. We continue to expect our margin improvement through 2012 as new projects ramp up. We introduced new technology and continue to improve our results in those markets, where we have made strategic investments and secured key wins over the past few years. ","To give you more granularity on the financial results, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark A. McCollum","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our revenue in the first quarter was $6.9 billion, down 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Total operating income for the first quarter was $1.3 billion, down 7% sequentially. North America revenue grew 1%, while operating income declined 5% compared with the previous quarter. As Dave mentioned, inefficiencies associated with equipment relocations, continuing cost inflation and pricing pressures in certain basins impacted our margins during the first quarter. We expect disruptions related to rig movements to impact us in the near term. And perhaps with the exception of guar, we anticipate some relief from suppliers in the second half of the year related to high cost of proppants and other materials. ","Due to these challenges and the negative impact of the seasonal Canadian spring breakup, we expect to see lower revenues and margins dropping by 200 to 250 basis points in the second quarter. We also now anticipate margins could drift toward the low 20 range by the end of 2012. The market is understandably very dynamic right now. These margin expectations depend on, among other things, our success in recovering inflationary cost increases from our customers and how soon the natural gas rig count levels off. We should have a better feel for this after the second quarter. ","Internationally, revenue and operating income declined compared to the previous quarter, driven by the traditional seasonal reduction of our international business. In the first quarter, we also usually see weather-related weakness in the North Sea and Eurasia, and this year was no different. As we look ahead, we anticipate our Eastern Hemisphere margins will reach the mid- to upper-teens in the second half of 2012 and average in the mid-teens for the full year. ","Now looking at our first quarter results sequentially by division. Completion and Production revenue declined $38 million or 1%, primarily due to seasonally lower Completion Tool sales and first quarter weather disruptions in the North Sea, Eurasia and Australia. Completion and Production operating income declined 5%, primarily due to North American inefficiencies associated with equipment relocations and other factors that Dave mentioned earlier. ","Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis. North America revenue increased by 1%, driven by increased activity in the U.S. oil and liquids-rich basins and Canada. This was partially offset by activity decreases in the U.S. dry gas basins in the Gulf of Mexico. Operating income declined 7% due to equipment relocations, cost inflation and stimulation pricing. In Latin America, Completion and Production posted a 2% sequential decrease in revenue due to reduced submitting activity in Colombia and Mexico and lower Completion Tool sales in Brazil and Trinidad. Operating income grew by 8% as a result of increased Boots & Coots activity in Mexico and Venezuela. ","In Europe\/Africa\/CIS, Completion and Production revenue decreased 8%, primarily related to lower activity in the North Sea and Eurasia due to the normal first quarter seasonal weather impact. Operating income increased 30% due to increased Boots & Coots profitability throughout almost all of Africa, along with higher cementing activity in Mozambique. Also contributing to the profit increase was higher production enhancement and cementing activity in Libya, along with a collection of some of the receivables that were written off there in early 2011. This was partially offset by seasonally lower activity in the North Sea and Russia and lower cementing and production enhancement profitability in Angola. In Middle East\/Asia, Completion and Production revenue decreased by 7%, primarily due to seasonally lower Completion Tool sales across the region and seasonal weather issues in Australia. Operating income increased 2% due to increased cementing and production enhancement activity in Oman and additional Boots & Coots activity in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Indonesia. ","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income decreased primarily due to seasonally lower software and direct product sales in the first quarter as well seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea, Eurasia and Australia. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation's revenue and operating income were up 2% and 7%, respectively, due to higher activity in drilling fluids, directional drilling and increased drillbit sales in U.S. land, as well as higher wireline activity in Canada. These increases were partially offset by lower software sales and decreased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico due to scheduling delays that we expect to make up next quarter. ","Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income decreased primarily due to seasonally lower software sales and the normal first quarter delay in obtaining contract approvals for consulting services and software sales in Mexico, as well as lower directional drilling activity in the first quarter in Mexico. In the Europe\/Africa\/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were down due to the seasonally lower software sales, seasonal weather impacts in the North Sea and Asia and lower drilling activity in Algeria and Angola. This decrease was partially offset by increased drilling activity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East\/Asia revenue and operating income decreased due primarily to lower first quarter product sales in Asia that were partially offset by increased drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and higher project management activity in Iraq. ","Our results for the first quarter reflect a $300 million accrual in Corporate and Other expense for estimated loss contingencies related to Macondo. At the request of the court, in late February, we participated in a series of discussions with the magistrate judge relating to whether the multidistrict litigation or MDL could be settled. Although those discussions did not result in a settlement, we've accrued $300 million, reflecting our current estimate of the loss contingencies that are probable relating to the MDL. Our decision to take an accrual now in the amount we have recognized are based on our assessment of all of the facts and circumstances regarding the litigation at this point in time. Although we continue to believe that we have substantial legal arguments and defenses against any liability and that BP is required to indemnify us for any losses we may ultimately incur, we've determined that we can no longer conclude that a probable loss associated with the MDL is 0. There are other contingencies related to the Macondo well incident that are reasonably possible and for which a reasonable estimate cannot currently be made. We're constantly monitoring and evaluating developments relating to the MDL and the other Macondo-related lawsuits and investigations. And it's possible that we may adjust our estimate of these loss contingencies in the future as new information becomes known. ","Apart from the Macondo-related charge, our Corporate and Other expense came in lower than expected in the first quarter due in large part to the timing of expenses related to our continued investment in our initiative to reinvent our service delivery platform in North America and to reposition our supply chain, manufacturing and technology infrastructure to better support our projected international growth. The expense related to these initiatives during the quarter totaled approximately $23 million, which was slightly less than we had expected. However, the activities behind the cost are on schedule and we continue to ramp up through 2012. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share after-tax in the second quarter. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $110 million and $115 million per quarter for the remainder of 2012, which, for the total year, is in line with our previous guidance. ","We anticipate that our CapEx for the year will still be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. But we've decided to defer some of the North American pressure pumping equipment deliveries into 2013 that were originally planned for 2012. In addition, more capital will be allocated to international projects that we've recently secured or expect to win in the next couple of quarters. We're also allocating a significant amount of capital for infrastructure needs throughout the globe and in support of growth of our recent acquisitions. And finally, our effective tax rate was 32.3% for the first quarter, but the average rate was helped by the higher U.S. tax rate that was applied to the Macondo-related charge. We currently expect the full year 2012 effective tax rate will be approximately 33% to 34%, in line with the normalized rate we saw in the first quarter. Tim?","Timothy J. Probert","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Dave outlined earlier on the call, we've been very consistent in our outlook for our international markets, where we continue to expect gradual activity improvement based on meaningful increments in customer spending patterns and corresponding new rig arrivals. Growth drivers for us in the international markets revolve around the execution of our strategy in deepwater, mature assets and unconventionals. ","In deepwater, we continue to be pleased with our positioning. And globally, the deepwater services market is expected to grow by approximately 20% per year through 2015, with exploration spending growing 4% annually and development growing by 35% annually. And as this shift gets underway, we feel that Halliburton's well positioned to participate in all established and emerging markets. In East Africa, for example, there are now 5 deepwater rigs running compared to just 1 this time last year. And our new basins in Mozambique and Tanzania are now well established as a platform for long-term development there. Establishing a stronger position in deepwater for our wireline and testing services has been a priority for us, both in terms of technology development and market positioning. In addition to wins in East Africa, the logging package fee win for Petrobras in Brazil is a positive indication of our credibility in this market. We also believe, as Dave mentioned, we're well positioned for the deepwater drilling and testing tenders in Brazil. ","In mature assets, our customers continue to look for assistance in evaluating, planning and executing redevelopment programs. In Mexico, for example, our customer PEMEX took a thoughtful approach to redevelopment in Chicontepec. Our Remolino field lab generated an improved understanding of the subsurface, and combined with new technology applications and joint team work, is delivering outstanding results. The PA-1565 well that Halliburton drilled had an initial production above 3,800 barrels a day and delivered cumulative production equivalent to over 20 average wells in the region. This is a model which is being applied in other mature assets in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and one which we expect to have a positive business impact in the latter half of this year and into 2013. Halliburton's EquiFlow Autonomous Inflow Control Device is a key technology to facilitate mature asset development and has been introduced in several wells in Latin America and the Middle East. It's a 2012 Offshore Technology Conference Spotlight on New Technology Award winner and is a simple, reliable device developed to address problems of unwanted water or gas production and solves the problems of inefficiency in current inflow device designs. ","International unconventional development continues to provide increasing levels of encouragement to us. Halliburton has active frac spreads in Poland, Argentina, Mexico, Australia, Saudi and elsewhere, which is allowing us to build the requisite basin and subsurface expertise necessary for successful execution and is building a strong foundation for future growth. We're also pleased with the recently signed Framework Agreement between PETRONAS Carigali and Halliburton for the evaluation and development of global shale resources. This collaboration is expected to leverage our technology and expertise to enable PETRONAS to quickly gain experience in shale development. We plan to work with them to set up a Shale Technical Centre of Excellence in Kuala Lumpur. Dave?","David J. Lesar","Okay, thanks, Tim. Let me just quickly summarize, and then we'll go to questions. We're very proud of the results that we delivered in the first quarter, with double-digit percentage growth in the first quarter of 2012 in all geographies in most product lines. In North America, the impact of inefficiencies from rigs moving from natural gas to oily basins to pricing pressure and cost inflation will impact our profitability in 2012. We plan to mitigate these impacts through continued focus on execution, efficient supply chain management and cost recovery from our customers. We remain very optimistic about our Latin America business and believe recent operational success and contract wins position us well for the future. And we continue to be optimistic about Eastern Hemisphere, where we expect our margins will continue to improve throughout the remainder of 2012. ","So let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, I'm sure you get a lot of questions about pressure pumping pricing. So I guess, my angle on this is I'm curious about where spot prices are now relative to the pricing on your existing term contracts. Just wondering, are spot prices now in line with term? And how would you expect those contracts to get repriced? I mean, would it be a material change, is it down 10%? And I guess as follow-up to that, are you starting to see E&Ps sign up any term contracts now? Or is it still too early?","Timothy J. Probert","Well, Dave, this is Tim. We're still 80% to 85% long-term contracts. And so our exposure to the spot market is really quite limited. And clearly, there is, as Dave pointed out, a more aggressive stance in those spot markets, but it's one which frankly we're just not exposed to that much.","Mark A. McCollum","And let me also -- Dave, this is Mark. I'd also add, it definitely varies by basin in terms of the, we're still signing up term contracts. We have customers in certain of the liquids basins that are only re-signing up for term contracts, they're extending the contracts that they have and they're still continuing to be at fairly good prices.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But are they lower than they were before, I guess, is my question. And how much lower? Is it like a 10%, is it material?","Mark A. McCollum","In some of the oil basins, the answer is no, they're not lower.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I would assume the Eagle Ford is probably the most vulnerable out of all of those?","Timothy J. Probert","Yes. I mean, clearly, its proximity to the Haynesville makes it a much more vulnerable basin.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And as a related question, you were talking about your CapEx, and it looks like you're on track to spend less. But Mark, it sounded like you just kind of reiterated your $3.5 billion to $4 billion number. Just wondering if the North America market doesn't show any signs of tightening, you're saying you think your second half looks a little bit better. But if that doesn't happen, would you expect spending to start -- to cut spending and maybe be below that range? And now you've got Macondo just on the rearview mirror, just wondering what the thoughts are. I mean is there a potential for a buyback here, when you -- considering where your stock is trading now? If you cut CapEx, maybe buy back here at $32 here?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, let me take the questions in order. I think with regard to CapEx, I still feel very confident that we're going to spend in that range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. What I was trying to reiterate, that even though we may slowing down some of the equipment deliveries in North America, there's still quite a bit infrastructure that we're building out related to our facilities, the transloading facilities for sand and other activities here in the U.S., as well as we are winning quite a bit of international tenders that are requiring incremental capital to what we had built into our original plan. And so there is a shift of CapEx fairly immediately for mobilization into some additional international work that we're pretty excited about. So in total, I don't see a big shift and it's difficult for me to see, based on the outlook right now, that we would step down meaningfully from the CapEx number. Now towards your second question. We accrued something on Macondo. It's one of those that based on our evaluation of events that had transpired through the course of the quarter, we felt the need to do that under U.S. GAAP. However, I would say that we're a long way from having Macondo behind us. I mean, right now, we are still in litigation mode. There's still a fairly uncertain calendar as to when events around Macondo will take place. And so until such time as Macondo is dealt with in its entirety, I think it's going to be difficult for us to strategize on what other kind of corporate initiatives we might do with regard to any excess cash that we might have.","Operator","Our next question comes from James West of Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, quick question for you on North American margins. So we've got another decline in the second quarter, 200, 250 basis points. And then you alluded to margins perhaps dropping into the low 20% range, I think, in the second half. Correct me if I'm wrong on that.","Mark A. McCollum","Yes. It's sort of the trend toward the end of the year is what I'm alluding to.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So is that -- would that represent the bottom, given what you see currently in North America? I mean, some of that's just a mismatch between vendors, and some of the pricing declines in pressure pumping. And then is this -- are you backing off earlier statements that you guys have made that normalized margins would be more like in the mid-20s? Or is that still achievable after we kind of shake out 2012?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, to the first question that you ask, I think based on what we can see today, yes, that low 20s feels like that, that's a bottom. But again, as I mentioned, there's still a lot of movement out there. It's a very dynamic market, and so we'll continue to try to adjust as we see. I think towards your second question, our comments last quarter about normalizing in the mid-20s, related really to our outlook for the year of 2012. It's difficult at this juncture, given the dramatic decrease in the gas rig count and the current outlook for gas, to say that we would normalize at that point there. I mean, that's \u2013 so I am -- we're kind of coming off of that earlier guidance, at least with regard to 2012. I'm not going to try to crystal-ball where we see things going in 2013. But I do think structurally, in our business, when you look long term, through the cycles themselves, that mid-20s range is essentially where our business tends to operate. And we are driving initiatives inside the company to reduce our cost structure in a way that can give us a fighting chance even if the market begins to flatten out toward the end of the year that we can find our way back to those mid-20s range if we execute well against our cost initiatives.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just one question on the international side of the business. Is there real spare capacity internationally right now? And if not, at what point do you think we do start to see real pricing traction? Or are we just going to let the offshore drillers have all the fun here?","Timothy J. Probert","Yes, James, this is Tim. I think just really following on from one of the remarks that Mark just made now that the shift of capital to the international markets, I think that's, if you like, a proof point really. If there was significant excess capacity, then we wouldn't be needing to move assets to the international market. So no, I would say that our general view is that, obviously, market-to-market, it's going to be slightly different. But in general terms, no, there's not a significant overhang of assets in the international markets today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. My question relates also to deepwater. You had mentioned a target of growing at a rate above market growth in deepwater. I just wanted to see, as we stand today, where you are versus that growth plan and where do you see it could be a year from now.","Timothy J. Probert","This is Tim again. Obviously, we selected deepwater as an important growth market for us in which to invest because of the significant above-market growth rate of the segment itself. And then we set ourselves a target of growing at above the market growth rate ourselves as a company. So I think point number one is the market is really unfolding as we hoped it would. It's going to be a very strong growth segment. Secondly, we're very pleased with our positioning. And I think we're able to support our thesis that we're growing at a faster-than-market rate.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of international shale growth, what's your view right now? We've heard some mixed views out of Poland recently. There've been some upheavals in Argentina recently. What's your current view on that? Are you seeing -- are you more positive now on international shale development or less? Could you comment on that?","Timothy J. Probert","Yes, I think we continue to be very encouraged. I think that we've always said that the best thing is for us to have interest in multiple markets because not all markets will be successful. We know that. But having a position in all major markets around the globe allows us to make sure that we're going to participate in those markets that are successful. We continue to feel very good about shales. I think that the truth is, though, to your question, we're probably shifting our emphasis a little bit. Argentina doesn't feel as positive as it probably was 6 months ago. But Saudi Arabia feels a lot more positive than it was 6 months ago. So I think we're starting to see, if you like, the 3 key factors of shales, the combination of the geology, the infrastructure and the pricing and regulatory environment sort of start to come to the fore. And those that have all 3 in the right measure will be the ones that'll move forward the fastest.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So beyond Saudi Arabia, how would you rank like Poland and Australia and some of the other markets?","Timothy J. Probert","Well, certainly, Australia is looking strongly positive. China's looking extremely positive. And I wouldn't count Poland out yet. I mean, there's a relatively small number of wells, primarily vertical wells, I would call the sort of the frac process there to be very modest in terms of trying to establish what potential productivity would be. So I think we still have a long way to go yet in that particular market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","My first question is in provinces, in frac-ing, where you have seen significant pressure on pricing, is there any pressure by companies that you have long-term contracts in to renegotiate the terms of your contracts at lower prices, even if you have a longer-term contract? And have you done so in any instances?","David J. Lesar","Yes, Jim, this is Dave. Let me answer that one. And the answer is in those oily based areas, the answer is no. In fact, we have gone generally back in because of guar prices or proppant prices to get price increases. But we -- for the most part, we wrote those contracts to be pretty tight. So I suspect that the pressure will come when they start to roll over, and we've got to look at what we can do. But again, we're selling efficiency, we're selling lowest unit cost because of the efficiency. And I think we are having a different kind of conversation with those customers than maybe some of our competitors would have to have.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","And that's in oil provinces, Dave, in the Haynesville, if a long-term contract customer is asking for price relief, have you done so?","David J. Lesar","You know what, Jim, there's hardly anybody left in the Haynesville but Halliburton. So you can read into that comment what you will.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","But David, your comments would relate to any -- to all instances of long-term contracts across the country that they're sacrosanct and you're not lowering prices on any?","David J. Lesar","No, I think that we -- are we rolling pricing back on existing contracts? The answer is no, the contracts that have term left on them. Those that are coming up for tender, we are having discussions about where the market pricing for long-term types of contracts are. We are not going to spot market by any stretch of the imagination.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. David, my second question, sources of mine are still saying that on international tenders, particularly in formation evaluation and particularly in deepwater, there continues to be fierce competition in pricing. Would you concur with that or put some -- what color would you offer on that statement?","David J. Lesar","No. I think as we said in the prepared remarks, any large tenders, deepwater-related that have a big formation evaluation component to them are extraordinarily competitive for a couple of reasons. One, they tend to be big dollars and they tend to be of long duration. And so they are being fiercely fought over. And I guess, I would make an editorial comment that all of the big players are equally competitive in their pricing. But as Tim indicated, I think we're winning more than our fair share of them, which is a strategy we put in front of our shareholders in our Analyst Day a couple of years ago. That was a key part of our strategy. I think it's paying off in places like East Africa, where we did have to make infrastructure and mobilization investments. But if you look at the margins we're making there today, I'm very happy with them. And I expect that, that will continue to play out as we get these projects up and going. So bottom line is I'm very happy with our market penetration in FE and in deepwater and in places where we have not operated before. And we will continue that strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Bernstein.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm curious as to how the activity transition in North America is impacting operational uptime, looking beyond the mobilization issue. When you look out 6 months from now, will you experience an increase in operational uptime, more operations on 24 hours? Or would things be about the same from here?","David J. Lesar","Yes, I think -- this is Dave again. Again, go back to what we said. We are primarily a 24\/7 operation, view our frac position in the U.S. as being more one akin to a manufacturing operation. And absent the dislocation of crews, which obviously have an impact on uptime and downtime, we don't move a crew unless we know where it's going, we know what customer it's working for and we know the price that it's going to work at. So we don't incur a cost to basically pick them up and move them somewhere without knowing what the financial impact is going to be. I would say that, that's not true with a lot of our competition who are being chased out of some of these basins, like the Haynesville, and those crews are going basically looking around for work. And that's why the transactional market pricing is so disruptive today. But as we said, that's not a market that we generally play in. So when we say we're moving a fleet, it's not going looking for work. It knows where it's going, knows who it's working for and knows the price that it's going to work at.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. And does the 24-hour uptime extend to the Permian as well?","David J. Lesar","It's just starting to go there. And that's actually a great question because typically the Permian Basin has not been a market where the operators saw the need to have 24-hour operations. But we have actually gone to 24-hour operations with some of the bigger players out there and have demonstrated to them the efficiency of it. Now that's caused some disruption within the operators because they've had to change their work practices, their completion practices. But as it's gotten more competitive out there, they've seen the benefits of it. But even in a market that's traditionally not 24 hours, it's starting to basically embrace it.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. That's very encouraging. Last question on Canada, appreciate the color. In terms of growth CapEx in North America, I assume Canada's going to continue to be a focus as you build out that position.","Mark A. McCollum","No, absolutely, Scott. We -- not only -- there's some infrastructure capital that we're deploying there. We're focused on the extension of the Bakken into Southern Canada there and building out there but also helping in our infrastructure around sand logistics and things like that. We tend to view Canada -- I mean, even though it's a separate country, we tend to view capital deployed for rolling stock and things like that as a bit fungible between the U.S. and Canada. And so during breakup, oftentimes we'll move things back and forth to make sure that we maintain very high efficiency levels for those crews.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","A question on the cost inflation. Dave, for a couple quarters here, we've been talking about the lead lag here between incurring costs from vendors and being able to pass them through to the customer and with increasing difficulty, I guess, in dry gas plays. But in due course, you seem to foreshadow an ability to do that. I'm curious as to actually with regard to the cost of the raw material itself, guar, proppants, what-have-you. At what point do these headwinds with regard to margins become tailwinds with regard to the raw material itself becoming less expensive with more supply?","David J. Lesar","Yes. I think, certainly on guar, we've not reached that point. And yes, we clearly are able to, on things like guar, with some lag, get that cost passed through to our customer. The problem with guar, it's probably the fastest-moving commodity price that I've ever seen. I mean, basically, we might give a quote today that's 10% higher than a quote we would've got last week on it. So it is such a dynamic that we don't like to and don't want to go back to our customers multiple times to get price increases. So we try to get it stabilized within a certain area then go back to the customer and basically put it through as a pass-through item. But that is the one, because of the scarcity at this moment in time -- and we do believe that it's actually a bit of a spot price scarcity due to sort of the growing season for guar, which is primarily grown in India, and when the new crop will become available which should be in the fall, and then we see maybe see some of the scarcity going away. And also obviously, we, like the rest of industry, are looking for alternatives to guar, and we are having some customers accept either lower-grade guar or alternatives to guar that, while maybe not getting the well response they want, at least they are getting something at a cheaper price.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Got you. And do you think -- I mean, I know it's difficult to sort of foreshadow at this juncture. But do you think it's a reasonable expectation to expect that the guar cost inputs in 2013 will probably be less than what they are today?","Mark A. McCollum","Based on everything we know right now, that's a reasonable expectation.","Timothy J. Probert","Yes. I think also, Bill, the fact of the matter is, is that guar substitutes become attractive at a certain guar price. We're at that price right now. So guar substitutes, whether or not that's Halliburton's CleanStim technology, for example, which is certainly a substitute which has been used effectively in a number of basins, including the Eagle Ford, or other substitutes, will become effective and will essentially create some sort of ceiling on the price of guar.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Got you. Second question, I mean, everybody, I guess, justifiably seems to be focused on what's going wrong as opposed to what can go right in a category of what can go right. With regard to the likely uplift in activity, in the Wolfcamp activity, plus a step change increase in service intensity, coupled with the ongoing evolution of the Utica and other plays, how do you think the industry is positioned today from a capacity standpoint to meet that demand, call it, 2 or 3 years down the road?","Timothy J. Probert","Yes, I think a couple of points there, Bill. I think number one, I mean, clearly, the industry has a history of responding to the need. I don't particularly see that as being a primary concern. And so I think that if you take a look at where we are today as we outlined, what we're planning on is a modest single-digit increase in activity through the year. Now that's the basis for the guidance that we provided. And clearly, there is a scenario where we have a significantly increased volume of activity in oil-based plays. If that takes place, then clearly, we have a much more robust outlook than we currently have. But we provided you a scenario based on our best guess, which is [indiscernible].","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Got it. And then last one, you touched on this, but I didn't get a sense as to order of magnitude. Frac of the Future initiatives, one, are they tracking as expected and targeted? And two, when do you expect those to begin to exert a significant impact with regard to your North American profitability?","Timothy J. Probert","So there are a number of elements to Frac of the Future, all aimed at a variety of elements around reduced personnel, reduced capital deployment, et cetera, and improved efficiency. Probably the largest single element of that is the rollout of our Q10 pump, which is now rolling off the line. And we will make that together with our new blending and storage capacities. And we have a deployment plan which will give us the ability to compare very effectively between existing fleets and our new Frac of the Future fleets, so we can get a real good handle on both capital deployment and people deployment. We'll see those roll out during the course of this year, Bill. And towards the end of this year, we'll have a very -- start to see an impact in key basins, where they're deployed.","Mark A. McCollum","I was also going to say at the back-office initiatives, the mobility plans are all designed to roll out late Q2 and Q3, which really means that you're going to see the meaningful part of the impact in 2013.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And the leaning out of the frac crews, we still expect to see an overall sort of reduction of about 25% on average with regard to the employees attributable to your frac crews?","Mark A. McCollum","Yes, Bill, that's still the target. Part of that will be achieved through the rollout of these new pumps and the blending units and other things that allow us to do less maintenance out on location. The other thing will also be the mobility plan helps us in achieving more of our remote operations initiative, which again will be later in 2013. But in particular areas such as the gas basins, our guys are very focused on leaning out those crews as we speak as the work provides for it. Other places, we're still scrambling as you might imagine, and it's all hands on deck.","Operator","Our final question comes from Doug Becker of the Bank of America.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll hit the international side a little bit, but it seems like results are off to good start. What do you think the greatest risk to meeting margin expectations in the high teens by the end of the year are? Is it more mobilization? Is it just more pricing, never picking up? How would you characterize that?","Timothy J. Probert","This is Tim. I would say that one of the things that we have collectively been disappointed with is essentially the growth of rig count and growth of activity during the course of the last 12 months. Year-on-year, we're only up about 2% in terms of rig count. So I would say the biggest single risk probably is more around ensuring -- well, I said not that we can ensure it, but it's more around the continued expected progression of rig count through the balance of the year than any other factor. It looks good right now, but we have been disappointed before by the amount of growth.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And it looks like we saw a relatively modest decline in revenue and margin in Europe\/Africa\/CIS. Is the first quarter a good base for us to be thinking about a bit of a recovery, a seasonal recovery in the second quarter in that market?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, clearly, there'll be seasonal recovery. You have to recall that the weather in Northern Europe on the North Sea was incredibly bad this year, probably worse than it's been in a long time, the exact total opposite from what we experienced in North America. So I think that the seasonal impacts were larger than we had seen in some prior years, which probably is part of what you've seen and maybe missing your potential -- your particular expectation. But I think in that regard then, we should see a better seasonal recovery from some of those areas as we go into Q2 and Q3.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's what I was getting at. And then just in Latin America, any quantification of what the mobilization might be in the second half? Are we talking 100, 200 basis point drag or something along those lines?","Timothy J. Probert","I think a little too early to say right now. We can provide some additional guidance on the next call.","Kelly Youngblood","Okay, Sean, we're ready to close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone. Our performance this quarter demonstrates that Halliburton is the execution company, and we are the leader in North America. Here are our few key highlights. Total North America revenue increased 24%, outpacing the average outpacing the average sequential US land rig count growth of 21%. North America margins grew into the double digits. And although our international operations continued to be challenged, the numbers came in about as expected. And we continue to tailor our business to the market as we wait for our recovery. And we outperformed our major peer in every single geo market, demonstrating once again that we continue to grow our market share globally. ","Since this is my last call, today I want to share with you my view of the evolution of the North America land market. Our customer base there and why I believe it will continue to surprise to the upside. Now for 25 years I have had fantastic front row seat to the development of US unconventional resources. We have become the largest service company in North America and that growth didn't by accident. First, it was due to the leadership of Jim Brown and his visionary management team. They saw the potential of unconventional resources in the region but the same time as a group of key early mover customers. As a result, we decided to work together using lots of trial and error to unlock this resource. We established enduring customer relationships and gained unparallel base and knowledge that still provides us a sustained advantage today. ","I think it's important to look at the North America unconventional ecosystem to understand our customers' behavior. And why their ability to so quickly increase production has expanded rapidly. Currently, there is strongly held view by energy investors that the US independent operators behave as a group. That view is wrong. When thousands of companies make discrete decisions about the same market, each day they do have tendency to swing the activity and production pendulum to far one way or the other. That is not group bank, is the impact of individuals trying to do the right thing for their investors. ","Our US customer base is not 10 or so countries like OPEC. It is made of thousands of companies from IOCs to individually owned businesses. When you look at them separately, you see thousands of entrepreneurial, smart and motivated risk takers. They readily adapt to the quality of their reservoirs, have almost unlimited access to capital, aggressively applying new technology and quickly mark their business model and structures to meet changing market conditions. And, yes, sometimes even take advantage of US restructuring laws.","They are you are classic American entrepreneurs, and their success should recognized. In Silicon Valley, such a success would be greatly celebrated as another industry disruptor. The unconventional disruption is not widely celebrated beyond the energy space, but it should be. The development of US unconventional resources has been as disruptive to the global energy market as Amazon has been to Big Box Retailing or Uber to the taxi business. You don't leash to wave of cheap, reliable energy that is disrupted global geopolitical and energy dynamics. Made the US more energy independent caused OPEC to react and changed the fundamental economic of offshore production. And I believe it is created a hundreds of billions of dollars of economic value, added hundreds of millions of dollars to government tax coffers and provided untold savings for consumers. So unconventional is what I would call a disruptor, so let's celebrate that.","I've heard energy investors say that today's customer behavior shows nothing was learned in the last downturn. That simply is not true. Our customers are smart and adoptive. And they do learn from the past. Their business DNA is to be survivors and they are. Look at the reaction in the past several weeks. Today, rig count growth is showing signs of plateauing and customers are tapping the brakes. This demonstrates that individual companies are making rational decision in the best interest of their shareholders. This tapping of the brakes is happening all over the place in North America. I can tell you the market will respond, it will rebalance and these companies will stay alive, survive and thrive because that's what they do. ","I said several quarters ago the customer and animal spirits back and they are with a vengeance and they are now running free to North America. Here is my last piece of wisdom for you. Do not bet against the animal spirits that our North America customers embody. I never have and I never will because that is the bet that you will lose. ","Now today is my last conference call. And I'd like to take a moment to thank our analysts and investors. It has been pleasure working with you and although we haven't always agreed, I've always enjoyed the spirited debate and intelligent conversations. I'd also like to thank the employees at Halliburton for their hard work throughout my career. We've been through many cycles, emerging stronger from each one and I am proud of what we've accomplished together. And even though I'll be absent from future calls, I look forward to the next 18 months serving Halliburton as Executive Chairman. I am happy to leave these calls in capable hands of Jeff, Chris and the other members of our experienced management team. I have not doubt they will continue to lead the company as a customer centric and returns focused business. And remember one thing, we are the execution company. ","With that I'll turn the call over to Jeff. ","Jeff Miller","Well, thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our second quarter results. We continue to execute our strategy to maximize asset value for our customers and deliver differentiated technology and services that we believe will generate superior returns over the long term. ","Here are some highlights for the second quarter. Total company revenue was $5 billion, representing a 16% increase compared to the first quarter of this year. Total adjusted operating income was $408 million, primarily driven by continued strengthening of market conditions in North America, which were partially offset by pricing pressure internationally. Our North America revenue increased by 24% outperforming the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 21%.","The Completion and Production division revenue increased 20% and operating margins improved by an impressive 700 basis points to approximately 13%, driven by the strength of our production enhancement, cementing and completion tools product service lines. Cash flow from operations delivered about $350 million. ","I'd like to a moment now to welcome some of the Summit ESP and its employees to the Halliburton family. We are pleased to announce this recent transaction and are excited about what it means for us as we continue to strengthen our artificial lift capabilities. Now I'd like to provide some regional commentary around our quarterly performance. I believe we found the bottom of the international rig count in the first quarter. However, I don't expect a near term rebound in the international markets for several reasons. First, the lengthy contracting cycles will mute any near-term pricing inflection. Second, our international customers need confidence and commodity prices in order to overcome the duration risk in their project. We continue to collaborate with our customers to lower the cost on these projects and while some are moving towards FID, it's important to remember that there is a significant time between planning FID and revenue generation for Halliburton. And finally, I've been consistently more conservative on the international market. And it's played out exactly how I called it. Today, I expect that there will be improvement and activity over the remainder of the year. But these improvements are not concentrated enough to offset the continued pricing pressure. As a result, the international markets will continue to move sideways. With all of this said, it's important to understand that we are now into the third sequential year of significant under spending in the international markets. This implies that the production decline outside of certain OPEC countries will begin to accelerate, particularly next year as the backlogs of new projects are completed and additional projects are not coming behind. ","In the meantime, we are actively managing cost while protecting our valuable international position for the eventual market recovery. With the current level of under investment internationally, production declines are a certainty and you know where that leads. ","Our Drilling and Evaluation division is driven in large part by our international footprint. And while we experienced a modest increase this quarter, largely driven by increased drilling activity in Latin America and the seasonal rebound in North Sea and Russia, the overall market continues to move side ways with continued pricing pressure. ","Now turning to North America. After the operation we gave in the first quarter, some of you were skeptical when we accelerated our equipment reactivation. But based on performance during the second quarter, there is no doubt we successfully executed our plan and that this decision was not only right but dead on target. Why is that? During the second quarter, we continue to see strong incremental demand for completion equipment from customers. The reactivated equipment we brought back with the market leading edge pricing and it has been accretive to overall margin and is expected to deliver acceptable returns that exceed our cost of capital. ","Our sand war room and logistic central structure allow us to manage the completions intensity our customer demand today. And we've been successful passing along supply cost increases to our customers. Our internal manufacturing capability is a proven differentiator in today's environment. It allows us to be flexible. And being able to build what we need, when we needed particularly in a rapidly changing market. Now today, we believe the current customer demand has outpaced the supply of completions equipment and this should create runway for a strong utilization through the second half of the year. We remain committed to generating industry leading returns and reactivating our equipment was the first step towards delivering the results you have come to expect from us. As some of you've heard me say before, customer urgency is the foundation for the path to normalize margin. Today, our customers remain urgent. And therefore, we believe our path to normalized margins is achievable. We get there through a combination of increasing leading pricing, improved legacy pricing, better utilization and continued cost control. ","Let me be clear. Our pressure pumping equipment is sold out in the third quarter. As we gauge the utilization of our equivalent on a 24x7 basis, we see a significant opportunity to improve and drive the downtime out of our calendar. In this environment, it's imperative to be aligned with the most efficient customers where we can create value for them while delivering the best returns for Halliburton. Filling our calendar with high proficient customers is an important part what allows us to achieve margin goal.","Looking forward, it's too early to tell the impact of commodity prices on customer plans for 2018. However, as Dave said earlier in Halliburton we never underestimate our customers' ability to adapt to the environment. In the first quarter, we experienced significant inflation in sand prices and increased volumes. As we continue to pass through sand cost to our customers, we expect to see greater technology adoption making better wells through engineered solutions. ","For the first time in years, in the second quarter we experienced our first decline in average sand pump for well. Let me repeat that because I think this is important. We saw a decline in the average sand pump per well. And while this is only one data point, it's something we will be watching. We believe current sand price levels have encouraged operators to optimize their completion design using more science as opposed to simply maximizing sand and trade for increased production. We maximize returns on our technology investment by being the most effective in the market at lowering our customer's cost per BOE. Our strategy around technology development is to make returns for Halliburton. Very simply our decision process around technology can be summed up in a three questions. First, does it reduce cost? Second, does it produce more barrels? Or third, does it do both? As a result, we create cutting technology that sets new standards for service quality and performance while making better wells for our customers. ","For example, on a recent effort in the Permian basin we used our Trans and permeability modifiers to increase production by over 60% compared to previous completion methods. The Trans and permeability enhancer portfolio is our premier offering for flow enhancing technology. Using proprietary micro motion technology Trans and enhancer expand the reservoir contact area and improve fluid flow to increase the recovery factor for our customers. For unconventional matured fields, we developed the bare shield like fluid system. Tailored to reservoirs salt formation and low fracture pressure to reduce circulation loss and washout. This custom tailoring allows us to reduce muddle off, increase drilling efficiency and ensures zonal isolation for an efficient completion.","In today's environment, it's crucial that technology be adaptable to customer demand and improves efficiency. During the second quarter, our industry leading cementing technology [Neosam] was used in over 350 wells per month. Including cementing the longest onshore lateral in history. A well that we are now completing. Neosam delivers high performance compressor strength, elasticity and share bond that lower density in conventional system saving time and providing improved performance. Now these three examples show the creativity of our chemistry based research and development teams. We have terrific engineers and scientists looking at every way we can create efficiencies, reduce cost and make more barrels. ","Internally, we have similar initiative of continuous improvement, including reducing the time for R&D projects to come to market like our very deep resistivity tool which went from design to field in only nine months. Our surface efficiency initiative of hydraulic fracturing that reduce the downtime between stages. We are always pushing to improving our processes and optimize the services that we bring in the market. ","Overall, I am confident about Halliburton's ability to grow North America margins and maintain a run rate for our international business for the remainder of the year. Our strategy is working well. And we intend to stay to course. We'll continue to drive superior execution and remain absolutely focused on delivering best in class returns. North America is clearly serving us as the world swing producer which means this is where the game will be played and Halliburton is the distinct leader in this market. ","Now I'd like to welcome Chris Weber to the Halliburton team as our new CFO. Throughout his career, he is working consulting operations and finance with significant international experiences. These combined traits will help Halliburton and may make him an excellent fit for our team. ","With that I'm going to turn the call over to Chris to provide some details around our financials. Chris? ","Chris Weber","Thanks Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Let's start with the summary of our second quarter results compared sequentially to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, representing an increase of 16%, while operating income doubled to $408 million. These results were primarily driven by the improved activity in pricing in our completion and production division in our North America.","Now let me compare our divisional results to the first quarter of 2017. In our Completion and Production division, second quarter revenue increased by 20% while operating income increased 170% primarily driven by increased activity in pricing in our U.S. land pressure pumping business. We also experienced well completion activity primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Russia, partially offset by pricing pressure in the Middle East. ","Turning to our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by 9% and 2% respectively, primarily due to increased US drilling activity. In United States, our drilling and evaluation revenue grew in line with rig count. On the international side, revenue was up due to increased drilling activity in Latin America, North Sea and Russia, partially offset by price pressure across the international markets. ","Now let me take a minute to compare our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 24% sequentially, primarily driven by continued improvement in pricing and activity in our US land business, particularly our pressure pumping and well construction product service lines, as well as higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 10%, primarily driven by increased drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela and Columbia, as well as higher stimulation activity in Argentina. ","Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue increased 12%, primarily due to a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and Russia resulting in higher drilling, well completions and pipeline and process service activity. For Middle East-Asia, revenue increased 2% primarily as a result of increased fluid services in Asia-Pac and higher wire line and well completion activity in the Middle East, partially offsetting these increases were pricing pressure throughout the region, as well as declines in fluids and stimulation services in the Middle East. ","Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $114 million in the second quarter, which was higher than originally anticipated, primarily due to approximately $42 million in litigation settlement and one time executive compensation expense during the quarter. Of which $29 million in a loss contingency in connection with an understanding with the SEC staff to settle the previously disclosed investigation of certain past matters related to our operations in Angola and Iraq. The settlement is pending approval by the commissioners of the SEC. Separately; the DOJ has advised this but has completed its investigation of these matters and will not be taking any action. We anticipate that our corporate expenses will be approximately $70 million for the third quarter of 2017. ","During the quarter, we also recognized a pretax charge of $262 million for a fair market adjustment which is required by accounting rule related to an expected exchange of $375 million of our Venezuela receivables for an interest bearing promissory note of that same value. This note is with our long standing primary customer in Venezuela similar to the Venezuela notes exchange we did in the second quarter of 2016; this new instrument will provide a defined payment schedule while generating a return. We intend to hold the notes to maturity and expect to collect 100% of the principal. It's important to note that to date, we've received all payments required by the 2016 notes. ","At a function of reduced debt balance, we reported a $121 million in net interest expense for the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense for the third quarter to remain at a similar level. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in lower than expected at approximately 23%, due to certain discrete items related to prior year audits. For the remainder of 2017, we still expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 29% to 30%. ","Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was approximately $350 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents. These results were largely driven by improvement in day sales outstanding. Historically, our annual cash flow is backend loaded for the year and we don't believe that 2017 will be any difference. Continued improvement in our earnings in a number of working capital initiatives should strengthen our cash generated from operations as the year progresses. ","Now I'd like to provide some color on our near-term operational outlook. The Macro micro dynamics make forecasting a challenge but this is how we see the third quarter playing out. For our Completion and Production division, we expect that our North America sequential revenue will outperform average US land rig count, while international revenue will remain flat. In addition, we expect margins for the division to increase by 225 to 325 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating North America revenue will grow in line with the average US land rig count, while the international market will remain flat to slightly down. We expect margins for this division to remain relatively flat sequentially.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for a few closing comments. Jeff? ","Jeff Miller","In closing, there are few things I want to highlight. Our second quarter results clearly demonstrated the strength of our franchise in North America and our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. If you believe in energy, you should be invested in North America. Halliburton's relative performance for the balance of the year will remain strong. As a result of our ability to grow our North America margins and continues to maintain revenue and margins in our international business. Our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. We'll continue to drive superior execution and remain focused on delivering best-in-class returns. ","I want to take a moment to thank Dave for his leadership at Halliburton during the 17 years as CEO. He created an amazing legacy and our employees, customers and shareholders have benefited greatly from his management of our company. I have had the pleasure of working with Dave for almost 30 years. He is an important mentor to me. Together, we developed the strategy and leadership team for our company and I look forward to working with him over the next 18 months. ","Before we open the call up for question, I'll go ahead and ask the first one myself because I know it's on everyone's mind. What are we doing around new build equipment? The simple answer is that we are first and foremost a returns focused organization. We have the ability to make a series of discrete decisions around equipment and will only bring it out under certain conditions. First, that it is backed by customer commitment. Second, that it captures leading edge pricing which is accretive to our margins. And finally, it generates acceptable return on investment. So let me remind everyone, that we have not invested in our legacy fleet in two and half years, prudently managing the health of our fleet is important to maintain the type of service quality and reliability that our customers have come to expect. Therefore, some replacement of equipment will be necessary over time. Our manufacturing center in Duncan is a powerful, competitive differentiator for our organization. It allows us to be nimble and build equipment is needed with short lead times. This flexibility allows us to control the rate at which we manufacture, building as little as 2,000 horsepower at a time if need be.","We delivered what we said we would on the reactivation plan. When we build additional equipment, we will do it with same discipline around returns. Halliburton is the execution company and you have to trust me to do the right thing. Run the business in the right way and make the right decisions. That answers it. ","Now let's open it up for other questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo.","Jud Bailey","Thank you. Good morning. Great and first let me say it, Dave, congratulation on a great career, CEO of Halliburton. I enjoyed working with you last several years. Okay, thanks. First question, I wanted to just circle back on the impact of reactivation in 2Q and how to think about any impact on our third quarter. It was talked about in terms of impacting, negative impacting margins on your first quarter call. You still had incrementals in CMP close to 50%. Could you maybe walk us through how you are able to offset some of the reactivation costs? And then to what extent will reactivation cost impact the third quarter? And do you intend to reactive any more equipment or is it more refers or new build at this point?","Jeff Miller","Look, Jud. Thanks. Bottom line is the costs were lower than expected in Q2. And that's because we got there faster and cheaper than we thought. Our Duncan manufacturing team just simply way out performed both by speed and bringing down the cost of everything. The other thing that happened is our people went back to work faster and that's principally because of all of the demand that we saw for our equipment. I supposed one other thing as we were successful in bringing back a large quantity of former Halliburton employees which is something we always wanted to do, but that also mean to say go back to work more quickly with substantially less training. As we look ahead to Q3, obviously there will be new challenges to deal with. For example our employees. Our employees haven't had raises in three years. So we plan to for example provide our employees with raises. But I would like to do is to listen Chris' guidance on completion and production. We said we outperformed the rig count growth on revenue and continue to improve margin. So that's truly how we see that. ","Jud Bailey","Okay. And I just as my follow up just to kind of think about the progress on or just to CMP for now. One of the scenarios that talked about if oil prices stay between 45 and 50 that we continue to step up in terms of completion activity next couple of quarters then maybe level off. Is getting to normalized margins are realistic scenario in your mind? And if so, do we hit those by the fourth quarter or can we -- would it be reasonable to anticipate being at normalized margins in next year if activity were to kind of level off at 4Q levels? ","Jeff Miller","Look, we are not backing off our expectation on normalized margins. As I said it and I won't give you a date but I don't have a crystal ball but I'd suspect it would be into 2018. But it starts with customer urgency as I've described. And that really means having targets, to meet targets and that's where we absolutely shine it on. That's what our value proposition does. And we still see supply and demand tightness. I mean our calendar is full as we look out. And so I don't see any change in my outlook. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","James West","Hey, good morning, gentlemen. And Dave my congrats as well on one hell of a run at Halliburton. Jeff, I know you answered my question already to a certain extent at the end of your prepared comments there. But as we think about new builds in the market, you laid out your three criteria for new build. Are we at those criteria yet and are you contemplating new builds kind of as we speak besides replacement of increment and new builds? ","Jeff Miller","Yes, look, I am going to go back to what I said on this, James. And I'd be crazy to lay out our market strategy in detail here. But I laid out the conditions which is committed client contracts or commitments from clients, leading edge pricing and then the ability to generate adequate return. Short answer is we haven't built anything so far this quarter. But I'd say if the opportunity above does present itself then we have the ability and the capability to quickly meet that demand with Duncan. ","James West","Okay, fair enough. And then Jeff as my follow up here, we have seen some additions by smaller companies that are most of the ones that either IPO or tried IPO need to show some growth to do that. But as you look at your major competitors and look across the pressure pumping marketplace, do you see much additional or incremental horsepower being added outside of kind of what's probably the natural attrition in the market? ","Jeff Miller","No. I mean our view had always been that there would be attrition. We see that and today our view that market is in fact sold out. That's part of the reason we see ducks building and other thing, and we really got the same amount of horsepower that's been in the market, changed hands in a couple of instances but with respect to the headline amount of horsepower that was there in 2014, we are well short off that today. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons.","Bill Herbert","Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, a quick question here for you. Just given the absence of reactivation friction or at least not as much as in the third quarter, a sort of pricing that you are gleaning given the under supply nature of the frac market and the sense of urgency that you talked about, and a leveling off the supply chain inflation. And, yes, so that mentioned some wage inflation but why one incrementals in the third quarter for CMP be better than what they were in the second quarter because your guidance implies assuming a low double digit rate of revenue extension somewhere kind of in the 40% to 45% kind of margin range and strikes me as conservative based upon the fact as you have laid them out.","Jeff Miller","Well, first of all, I won't lay all of that out and when we think about what Dave said in terms of tapping the brakes. And so we see some tapping of the brake which in my view better described as let's going from 80 miles an hour to 70 miles an hour. But it hasn't limited the ability to push on price. And our guys absolutely doing that everyday. And as I said, we still see the customer urgency. So we are losing on price all of the time but I think that if we go back to Chris' guidance, I mean that's solid progress and particularly as I described kind of the macro environment that we -- I guess all have talked about. ","Bill Herbert","Okay. With regard to the cadence of reactivation during the second quarter. Would you describe those as having been relatively evenly distributed over the course of Q2, front end loaded or backend loaded? ","Jeff Miller","I think ratable sort of Q1, Q2. There was no particularly weighting one way or the other. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ange Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.","Ange Sedita","Thanks. Good morning. Certainly an impressive quarter to be your last one, Dave. And you'll certainly be missed and we wish you well in your new role. So on the question, for Jeff or Dave is on the completion of frac intensity. Is it fair to say that you haven't seen that year peak, and if so when you think about North American revenues going into 2018 in a flat rig market, should we still see revenues starting to flatten out as well or could you see still some growth in that revenue cadence with the completion intensity so thoughts on 2018 and its flattening rig market. ","Jeff Miller","Well, Ange, it's too early to call on 2018. What I would say the pace that we see, we see a solid ramp in terms of ability to execute and deliver on the things that we talked about with respect to normalized margins. We do see currently ducks Building, there is back and waiting to activity. And quite frankly the science continues to drive the business. And so I think in terms of peak, the peak is going to be probably more science based in the future and maybe less volume driven. ","Ange Sedita","All right. Fair enough. And then on pricing and pressure pumping. Thoughts on the outlook for pricing as we go into the back half of 2017 and even into 2018. Have you started to see deceleration in recent weeks? And going back to those flat rig market thoughts on pricing in a flat rig market. ","Jeff Miller ","So as I said, Ange, I am not going to layout our pricing strategy here on this call by any means. What I would go back to -- we push price all time, our guys, what we do is in high demand. And particularly in a market like we are in now where urgency matters, delivering targets matters to our customers. And that's where high proficiency and the technology that we bring are so valuable. And so I am confident that we are continuing to work. We talked about the leverage that we have in terms of leading edge priced, legacy fleet and then obviously cost and efficiency. So we work on all of those all the time. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. ","Sean Meakim","Hi, good morning. So, Jeff, you made a point and emphasis around sand demand perhaps starting to get smarter. But is it fair to say that service intensity likely continues to increase on average well basis going forward? And how would characterize the rate of change on overall service intensity?","Jeff Miller","Yes that the intensity continues to increase both rate and numbers of stages and those sorts of things. So I think it's more of - I'll bring it up simply because I've always believe that sand, a, is not infinite and it's not free. And so as we started to put constraints on sand in terms of availability cost, it's actually had a very rational impact driving thought around where it goes and how much in terms of total volume. But I'd say in terms of how it gets placed, I talked about it a couple technology examples in my prepared remarks. So those kinds of things the equipment work just as hard but it is how it is applied. So that's I bring that up today. We haven't seen that before really gosh in five years, six years and so it's one data point but it's one that I am certainly going to watch. ","Sean Meakim","Absolutely. And then just I wanted to also touch --based on the acquisition on Summit. Could you give us maybe a little more detail on the expansion strategy for that new business and just as you bring about M&A, is there other tuck-in need that keep filling up that lift portfolio or can you build also Summit here to really get where you think you need to go?","Jeff Miller","Yes, thanks, Sean. I mean the Summit deal is fantastic fit and fantastic people, is what I can say about that. I mean it was a great add for our artificial lift business. When we put our business together with Summit, it creates solid number two position and US, ESP, other technology and really loves their value proposition. I mean they are so dialed into how they respond to customers and they build the plumbing around that to do it very, very well. And so the strategy going forward is to use our footprint to create even more value which we know we can do. Starting here in the US but also internationally. We've talked about M&A before and I don't see -- we continue to be interested in growing our production group which includes all forms of lift. Happy with what we've done two on ESP today and then I've also talked about chemicals being probably more organic and less M&A but nevertheless there will be some M&A in that. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Jim Wicklund","Good morning, guys. And Dave it's been a fabulous almost two decades. But you are not going yet so we'll see other than on the conference call but congratulation on a great run. ","Dave Lesar ","You are right. I am not gone yet. ","Jim Wicklund","Now we got to bring that that up, make sure everybody understands he is hanging around for 18 more months. Jeff, you made an excellent point on the pricing of international saying that while overall activity is quick going down there is not enough bulk of activity in several markets to really get pricing improvement. Where do you expect to see internationally that the first level of activity getting high enough that we are not giving away price any more and a beginning of recovery?","Jeff Miller","Jim, it's going to be some spot whether as a discovery or there is enough sort of base load of activity to move quickly. If I had to guess there is probably some places in Latin America that might fill that bill. But as far as broad region that's really part of the issue, Jim, it's like peanut butter being spread around the world and gets enough traction in a particular spot. So that's why what makes it tough is simply because it will be very concentrated place when we start to see that. Now, the other side of that, that's one of the reasons we do protect our international franchise. We think that the investment we made over the last several years is valuable and will be more valuable in the future when that time comes but it's not -- yes, I think we are moving side wise for a while. ","Jim Wicklund","And in drilling and evaluation, you note that you had a $150 million increase in revenue but only a $3 million increase in income. And that clearly points to price issues. I am just wondering that you had a seasonal recovery in the North Sea and in Russia and those are two places we normally don't associate with Halliburton being leading edge. Were those two of your better markets or your worse markets? Can you talk about just on the drilling and evaluation side? Where those two markets fit? ","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean on a relative basis relatively smaller but quite frankly very good markets for us. And once I really want to give kudos to Joe Rainey and their team who have absolutely executed and build those businesses. So those are businesses that are in my view gaining traction in the DNA part of our business. Better alignment around customers, I think closer alignment with customers particularly in Russia today and very encouraging. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Anderson","Great. So, Dave, all the time on the road I think you've earned your downtime. Good luck on your next venture there. So, Jeff, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing -- slightly different way, you talked about getting leading edge pricing on your reactivated equipment. But I am curious for your legacy fleets out there. I think that's been one area you have been trying to keep that, you want to keep those relationships there. What's that spread now and the pricing between the legacy and kind of new equipment go on the market and when do you think that's start to close? Is that a year end? Is that kind of 12 months it takes to close that gap? What are your thoughts there?","Jeff Miller","Look, that's something that is closing I'd say sort of everyday as we work it. But let's go back to why there is a spread there. And it's because we are aligning with very good customers, they are very efficient and so we want to be part of their business. And we believe we can do a lot to help drive down sort of their overall cost and lower their cost per BOE. And so that's why we never had -- we abandoned half the market to go move somewhere else. We absolutely want to support all of our customers. So I am not going to give that spread. But I'll tell you it's something like I said in Q1 that we would be closing in on that over four quarters. So look for some time early in 2018 to have that done.","David Anderson","Great. Thanks. And then on -- in terms of your fleet now, what percentage of your rough fleet has your modern Q10 pump out there? And I was wondering if you could extend a little bit upon on that pump and how that changes in terms of the useful life of your equipment versus what's out there in the market? You touched on it before about the attrition out there. But just trying to get kind of senses as to kind of how your equipment is different in the market than other equipment out there and why we should we think about that differently?","Jeff Miller","Yes. So I mean I'd say we are probably in the 60% range or so for the following reactivation. The important thing about that equipment is that it is build for total cost of ownership. I mean we don't sell this equipment in the market. Our guys at Duncan are absolutely motivated by one thing. What is the most resilient, the efficient piece of equipment? And I go out and check to make sure that it's competitively priced which it is, but more important thing is cost is what it does for our guys in the field. And the way that it is integrated. So it runs a higher rate, it uses all the available horsepower, it's more efficient by still about a 20% efficiency compared to what we see in the market. So when I think about how do we make the best returns in the marketplace, we always think about how do we drive capital off of location and first thing to do is have more efficient pumps on location. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open. ","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning. And Dave congratulation and all the best. So, hey, Jeff, you run up very interesting comment little bit earlier about seeing first quarter here where sand used per well has declined. So wondering if you might be able to elaborate on that a little bit more? Do you sense that as you mentioned that it is truly purely an economic decision? Do you think it's an anomaly? Do you think there is shortage of sand that's driving it? Just kind of get trying to look for little bit more color on what you may be seeing? ","Jeff Miller","Look, I think it's really is part of the science of frac and that is if not the only thing it's not the customers are running from the economics but they are making very thoughtful economic decisions and as the availability or the actually the applicability of science so the better they understand, we collectively understand how to make more barrels. That gives put to work with clearly an economic backdrop. And I think that back to Dave's earlier comments on our customers. I mean this is an incredibly adaptive group of customers that I think it demonstrated through tougher cycle in our history and ability to consume science, consume lesson learned and move the cost per BOE down almost in the face of anything. And so I think what you are seeing is really the nature evolution of, okay as inputs move up for better ways to get more barrels and in some cases we are seeing that. This is not across the board but on overall basis that was the data point we saw. ","Kurt Hallead","Okay, thank you. And just maybe on the international front. I know you mentioned-- use the spreading the peanut butter analogy, but it seems like there is more concentrated increased activity levels going on in Latin America in a number of different countries. Do you feel like you could get pricing power moving in right direction in Latin America before some other region? ","Jeff Miller","Well, again I am not going to get our strategy around price anywhere but what I'd say Latin America is not too different in terms of the contract cycle terms of -- length of contracts typically have a muting impact. There is plenty of -- quite a bit of equipment in the world today and so certainly look forward to that but I'd not -- it's not enough to change the overall trajectory. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Waqar Syed","Thank you. And Dave congratulation again and you'll be certainly missed and your comments would be missed greatly on the calls. My question relates to the Permian sand that's been recently got FERC's, a new capacity additions have been announced and there is good chance that prices are going to fall quietly sharply in the Permian for EMP companies there. What impact does that have for pressure pumping companies as sand prices fall in the Permian? Is it neutral or is it negative or positive? And then also how do you think about your own investment in Trans loading and rail transportation? Would that change if most of the sand is regionally sourced? ","Jeff Miller","Look, that's great for us. It's good for our customers. It's good for us in terms of lowering cost per BOE. I've been very vocal about why we don't own mines and that's -- this is an example of why not bring it from Halliburton standpoint, why we wouldn't want to be invested and tied, was not cost to places, technology moves a different direction. Trans load infrastructure that we have is valuable. I'd say probably the toughest part to get to realistically is the Permian basin and local sand in my view opens up a whole new avenue of what is lower cost. And some of the things that we are doing around delivering sand. We are always looking at how do we get sand delivered at a lower cost point and I think our containerized solutions that we are implementing are right, right in the sweet spot of that kind of development.","Waqar Syed","Okay. And you don't see -- are there any long -term negative implications of -- cost implications for railcars or other things that you may have leased? Or the industry may have leased? ","Jeff Miller","No. I mean that's the stuff works all over the country and that's fairly localized solution. So I like what we are invested in. And we've always been careful. Again, we target about 50% of our capacities manage internally. And we do that so that we can flex with the market. And that's how I see this. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ole Slorer","Thank you very much. And again, Dave, congratulation for the very solid runs at Halliburton. Jeff, question to you again regarding kind of the sand logistics and the changes in completion again. I mean before you highlighted that at Halliburton doesn't really have any interest in owning sand but once the fork is on the logistics because of the changing nature of the type of proppants, that's preferred. So could you talk a little bit about the kind of capacity thing added at the moment in West Texas is kind of 100 mesh largely some 470 and address that in context of other proppants, how you see the mix evolving? And how that impacts Halliburton?","Jeff Miller","Well, look, we are in large part agnostic to the type of sand, the reality is we study sand closely to understand how to better design chemistry to make better frac. Cost is always a component of that. But we've seen other media sort of go into vogue and out of vogue and we've got mark risk out which is an NO style solution or micro style solution. So I think that obviously what's being talked about today is consistent with what I hear from customers. And what is being consumed today. But again that the drive for better science is always going on and that's one of the reasons our labs are constantly looking at, how to take what's available and make it better and how to either or to substitute with things that are better. So I think just the answer [Multiple Speakers] is inappropriate. ","Ole Slorer","So the reduction that you saw on a per well basis. Was that a function of shortages and sand pricing and therefore forcing industry to adopt different methods or do you see this trend continuing even it's kind of sand gets the bottlenecked? ","Jeff Miller","Well, it's one data point so I will clearly be watching that. Since that I get this more around design and what is the most -- our clients are dead focused on lowest cost per BOE, making more barrels and at a lower cost. And so designing things that can consume less sand but deliver more barrels or as many barrels is clearly what they want to do. ","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks. ","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Candice. Before we close, there are a couple points I'd like to highlight. First, our second quarter performance demonstrates strength of our North American franchise and our ability to adapt to rapidly changing environment. Second, Halliburton's relative performance for the balance of this year will remain strong as a result of our ability to grow North America margins and maintain revenue and margins internationally. Look forward to talking with you next quarter. Candice, you may now close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone."],"11090":["Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 17, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Kelly Youngblood - Senior Director of Investor Relations","David J.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the third quarter results is also available on Halliburton website.","Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development. Jeff Miller, our new COO, will not be a speaker today, but will be a key participant on future calls and investor events going forward.","I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, and recent current reports on Form 8-K.","Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing the third quarter results, which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website.","During the quarter, we recorded a $48 million charge, which amounts to $30 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to an earnout adjustment due to significantly better-than-expected performance of our Global Oilfield Services' Artificial Lift acquisition. These charges are reflected in our North America and Latin America Completion and Production segment results. Additionally, we recorded a $20 million gain, which amounts to $13 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, related to a recent patent infringement settlement that is reflected in our Corporate and Other expense.","As a reminder, our third quarter 2011 results included an asset impairment charge of $25 million, or $19 million after tax, in our Europe\/Africa\/CIS region. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items on our financial results. Also, for better comparability when discussing year-over-year rig activity, we will be excluding Iraq as certain historical data is not available.","We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David J. Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our overall results for the quarter. Total revenue of $7.1 billion was down 2% sequentially, driven by a 5% reduction in our North America revenues. Our international revenue was up 2% this quarter compared to a 2% rig count decline as a result of solid sequential growth in our Latin America, Middle East and Asia regions, where both had revenue records. Our Drilling and Evaluation division also posted record revenue in the quarter. From a product service line perspective, we had record revenues this quarter for Boots & Coots, Wireline and Perforating, Consulting and Project Management and Baroid, which also had a record quarter from operating income.","Operating income of $982 million decreased 18% sequentially, primarily due to pricing pressures and guar costs in our North America Production Enhancement business. International operating income was up 5%, and we are very pleased with the continued strengthening of our market position in key international geographies and product lines where we envision continued growth in the coming years. We believe our strategy is playing out as planned as evidenced by solid activity improvements this quarter in key geographies, such as Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Malaysia and Australia.","We continue to be very optimistic about our Latin America business, where we posted another excellent quarter. Revenue was up 8% sequentially despite a 5% drop in the rig count. Operating income increased 12% sequentially, led by solid performance in Mexico and Brazil. We saw a significant ramp-up in unconventional activity across all of Latin America during the quarter as we won new work with IOCs and independents in Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, where we recently completed the country's first microseismic analysis. In Mexico, we continue to introduce new unconventional completions techniques for horizontal wells. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect margins for Latin America to continue to expand, aided by the end-of-year software sales.","Our Eastern Hemisphere revenues grew 19% and operating income almost 70% compared to the third quarter of last year relative to a rig count growth of only 5%. We continue to see steady margin improvement and are optimistic about activity levels expanding in the fourth quarter and into the coming year. Overall, for the Eastern Hemisphere margins, we expect to exit the year with margins in the mid to upper teens and anticipate continued year-over-year margin improvement as we go into 2013.","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue and operating income increased 3% and 9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter. The improvement was driven by strong activity this quarter in Malaysia and Australia, along with improved results in Iraq. During the quarter, Halliburton provided integrated drilling and completion services for horizontal shale gas wells in both China and Australia. And in Saudi Arabia, we deployed the Stim Star Arabian Gulf, Halliburton's latest stimulation vessel providing state-of-the-art services for the Saudi market.","Europe\/Africa\/CIS had a slight decline in revenue and operating income compared to the previous quarter. Increased profitability in Russia and Libya was more than offset by activity delays resulting from election time shutdowns in Angola, strikes in Norway and reduced activity across continental Europe. Compared to the third quarter of last year, we achieved double-digit revenue growth in this region, and operating income grew 66% as we addressed underperforming markets. We are optimistic about the continued improvement in this region as we are currently pursuing price increases on a number of our contracts.","And our deepwater growth strategy remains on track. In the third quarter, we successfully executed our first complete well testing and subsea job in West Africa and expanded operations in East Africa with the addition of drilling fluid services on an exploration well for a large independent, offshore Kenya.","Overall, our outlook for the international markets has not changed. We continue to be faced with a series of macroeconomic headwinds: the European debt crisis, lower GDP expectations in China and Brazil and renewed tensions in the Middle East. Despite these factors, there is a tightness in global oil supply today and natural gas is expected to be the single, largest component of future energy demand growth. As a result, we remain very optimistic about the outlook for international services activity and our ability to outperform in that market.","As I stated earlier, we expect that fourth quarter margins will exit in the mid to upper teens, and 2013 will improve upon that year-over-year. Going forward, we believe margin expansion internationally will come from 4 key areas: volume increases as we ramp up on our recent wins and new projects, continued improvement in those markets where we have made strategic investments, the introduction of new technology and increased pricing and cost recovery on certain contracts.","Now let's turn to North America. Our North America revenues were down 5% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the lower U.S. land rig count, contract renewals that result in lower stimulation pricing and activity disruptions associated with Hurricane Isaac. U.S. land rig count declined sequentially by 68 rigs, or approximately 4%, as operators continued to decrease their gas-directed activity. The oil-directed rig count was up 44, or 3%, this quarter as customers continued to shift their budgets toward basins with better economics. However, this increase was insufficient to offset the 18% reduction in gas rig count.","In Canada, the rebound in rig activity from the spring breakup was significantly less than industry expectations. Compared to third quarter 2011 levels, Canada's rig count was down 116, or 26%, and we expect activity levels to remain subdued into the fourth quarter. Across the North American market, we have seen customers curtail spending compared to the first half of the year and believe they will continue to decrease activities to operate within their capital budgets for the remainder of 2012. Couple this with expectations that our customers will take significantly more holiday downtime than prior years, this could have an even more-than-normal negative impact on the rig count as we approach year end.","Our North American operating income was down 30% sequentially, driven by guar cost inflations and pricing pressures in hydraulic fracturing. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to work through our higher-priced guar inventory, and we expect our guar costs in the fourth quarter to be similar to this quarter, but we have made no additional purchases of guar. Moving into next year, we expect reduction in guar costs as we take deliveries of new lower-cost inventory, which we believe will translate into a tailwind to our PE margins in 2013.","We've also seen increased pricing pressures in the oil and liquids markets as we renew existing stimulation contracts and win new work. The continued migration of hydraulic horsepower into the oil basins has resulted in these areas being in especially crowded place for stimulation equipment today, with the natural outcome being overcapacity and pricing pressure. We expect this pricing pressure to persist through early 2013 as we renew our existing contracts. But in response to giving fracturing price concessions, we have negotiated pull-through of additional product lines. Several smaller stimulation companies have recently reported losses or breakeven levels of profitability. This has historically been a good indicator that the market is close to or at the bottom of spot pricing deterioration.","We remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in North America. Our stimulation fleet remains highly utilized today as we negotiate fracture contract renewals, and we've been able to increase our percentage of 24-hour crews. Many of our competitors simply do not have the infrastructure in place to meaningfully grow their 24-hour operations. This provides us with a unique opportunity to maintain superior asset utilization. And despite the 4% sequential decline in U.S. rig count, North American D&E revenue held relatively flat sequentially, while our operating income grew 5%.","Going forward, the successful company will be the one who could help lower our customers cost per BOE for drilling and completing unconventional wells. This is going to require 3 capabilities: an efficient pumping fleet, which we clearly have, especially as we expand our Frac of the Future footprint; 2, better well engineering and fracture design to drill more efficient wells, to only fracture the most productive zones; and 3, fluid systems that maximize reservoir response.","To address the second item, we have recently released the industry's most advanced software model called Knoesis. To address the third item, we have developed PermStim. I believe that both of these technologies will be game changers and differentiate us from those companies that have only pumping capability. Tim will discuss them more in a few minutes.","Turning to the Gulf of Mexico. Although there was some impact from Hurricane Isaac, the timing of certain projects was the primary driver of profitability this quarter. We are optimistic about the work that we have secured for new deepwater rigs arriving in the Gulf and expect that this will translate into higher market share relative to our historical levels. We're also optimistic about anticipated fourth quarter activity and believe we are well positioned to continue with strong growth in the Gulf in 2013.","So to summarize North America, we expect the next couple of quarters to be pretty bumpy. While we have an understanding of the price impact of our contract renewals, there remains significant uncertainty around customer activity levels throughout the fourth quarter, both in terms of rig programs and extended holiday downtime. Activity may be further impacted by the muted recovery in Canada by typical weather-related delays and by customers' decisions to drill but not complete wells. At this point, we believe the downside pressure to the fourth quarter outweigh in the upside, and we will take the necessary steps to adjust our operations.","Now we've been running our people and equipment flat-out for the past several years. So if this short-term drop in activity happens, we will not chase the lower price transactional work to keep our crews busy or to gain market share. This is something we traditionally would have done. We will instead stack our equipment and reduce labor costs by working with our employees to minimize the temporary impact of these disruptions.","The reason we are taking a different approach this time is because we believe these issues are transitory and we do not want to take the risk of lowering the pricing baseline for a problem that we will expect to go away in a couple of quarters, or to have our customers believe that such pricing would be the new normal going forward. I'm confident that our North America management team is up to this challenge.","We're forecasting modest rig growth in oil for 2013, assuming that commodity prices continue to support that. However, to return to the utilization levels we saw in 2010 and 2011, the industry will require some degree of recovery in the natural gas market. We continue to be very confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business and our growth strategy growing forward. We will continue to focus on maintaining our leadership position in North America, continuing to strengthen our international margins and grow our market share in deepwater and in global unconventionals and underserved international markets.","Now let me turn it over to Mark for a few minutes.","Mark A. McCollum","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Our revenue in the third quarter was $7.1 billion, down 2% sequentially from the second quarter. Total operating income for the third quarter was $982 million, down 18% sequentially, after normalizing for the acquisition-related charge and litigation settlement gain this quarter.","North America revenue and operating income decreased 5% and 30%, respectively, compared to the previous quarter with margins coming in slightly above 15%. As Dave mentioned, the lower U.S. land rig count, hydraulic fracturing pricing pressure and guar cost inflation were the most significant drivers, combined with lower customer activity and the impact of Hurricane Isaac. Canada had sequential improvement but the rebound from spring breakup was significantly less than we've seen historically.","In North America, we typically expect to see a drop in activity in margins due to holiday downtime and winter seasonality as we move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. This year, we're anticipating this sequential decline will be exacerbated by widespread activity reductions across the U.S. land market as a number of our customers work to maintain spending levels within their 2012 budgets. These activity reductions, along with the additional pricing pressure related to contract renewals, will most likely result in lower revenues and incrementally lower margins in the fourth quarter.","For international, we expect the usual sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, driven by landmark software sales, increased completion tool deliveries and end-of-year equipment sales. Typically, international revenues have increased on a percentage basis by low single digits from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, carrying higher margins as a result of these year-end activities. Similarly, we would then expect to see a sequential decline in international revenues and margins in the first quarter of 2013 as these activities subside, coupled with weather-related seasonality.","Now looking at our third quarter results sequentially by division. Completion and Production revenue and operating income decreased 4% and 30%, respectively. North America stimulation pricing pressure and guar cost issues drove the lower profitability but were partially offset by stronger results in our Middle East\/Asia region.","On a geographic basis, Completion and Production North America revenue and operating income were down sequentially by 6% and 39%, respectively, as increased activity in Canada was offset by the transitory U.S. land headwinds already discussed.","The Gulf of Mexico was also down sequentially due to the timing of completion tool sales and certain projects, as well as the impact of Hurricane Isaac. However, we're optimistic about higher activity in margins in the Gulf in the fourth quarter and going into next year.","In Latin America, Completion and Production posted a 10% sequential increase in revenue due to improved activity across most product lines in Mexico and higher completion tool sales in Brazil. Operating income, however, decreased due to lower overall profitability in Argentina and Venezuela and reduced cementing activity in Brazil and Colombia.","In Europe\/Africa\/CIS, Completion and Production revenue decreased by 5% and operating income decreased by 7%. Higher activity in Russia and increased Boots & Coots activity in the North Sea were offset by depressed North Sea activity in completion tools, cementing and lower stimulation vessel activity. Additionally, activity declines in Angola across most product lines contributed to the sequential decline.","In Middle East\/Asia, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased by 4% and 8%, respectively. The growth was driven primarily by strong stimulation activity in Australia, strong completion tool sales in Malaysia, growth in all product lines in China and increased cementing activity in India. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in completion tool sales in Indonesia and Brunei and lower Boots & Coots activity in Saudi Arabia.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased 2% and 9%, respectively, led by higher software and consulting services in Latin America and increased activity in the Middle East\/Asia region, where we had strong sequential growth in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia and improved profitability in Iraq.","In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue remained relatively flat while operating income increased 5%, primarily due to higher drilling activity in Canada and improved Wireline and Perforating profitability in U.S. land.","Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased 7% and 26%, respectively, due to improved activity in Mexico and increased software sales across the region. Additionally, Brazil had higher wireline and testing activity contributing to this growth. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced profitability in Columbia and lower testing and subsea activity in Mexico.","In the Europe\/Africa\/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income both came in basically flat with the previous quarter. Improved drilling fluids activity in Norway and Russia, increased Wireline profitability in Libya and higher activity and software sales in Angola were offset by lower directional drilling activity in Nigeria and the Caspian, along with reduced wireline activity across continental Europe.","And finally, Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East\/Asia revenue and operating income increased by 2% and 10%, respectively. Malaysia had strong results during the quarter in our directional drilling, wireline and perforating and testing and subsea product lines. Also contributing to the growth this quarter was increased wireline and perforating and directional drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and China, along with better performance in Iraq. Partially offsetting this growth was lower testing and subsea sales in China.","Our Corporate and Other expense was $87 million this quarter, excluding the patent litigation settlement gain and includes cost for our continued investment in various strategic initiatives. The expenses related to these initiatives during the quarter totaled approximately $32 billion, slightly more than Q2 but less than we were expecting for the third quarter. We anticipate the quarterly impact for these investments will increase in the fourth quarter to approximately $0.03 per share after tax. And in total, and combined with those initiative costs, we anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $100 million and $105 million during the fourth quarter of 2012.","Our effective tax rate, including the nonrecurring adjustments mentioned earlier, was 30.5% for the third quarter, which is significantly less than previously anticipated. And we currently expect the full year 2012 effective tax rate will be approximately 32%, which is, again, lower than past guidance.","As mentioned last quarter, one of the key strategic initiatives that we've been focused on is a realignment of our international operations to better position us for improved delivery of our products and services to our international customers, closer alignment to our international supply base, more efficient use of our technology and an overall reduction in cost.","Going forward, we expect to see an increase in our international earnings and a related reduction of our effective tax rate in future years. Specifically looking ahead to 2013, we expect to see a 200 to 300 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate as compared to the current full year 2012 rate.","We now anticipate that our capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. We'll be presenting our 2013 capital expenditure plan to our Board of Directors at the end of the year and will provide formal guidance on next year's capital plan during our fourth quarter call. However, our current expectation is that our overall capital budget will be lower in 2013 than 2012.","We currently intend to direct less capital toward the North America pressure pumping market. Our North American horsepower build will be aimed toward fleet replacement. The displaced equipment will be retired from the market, and the emphasis will be on the rollout of the Q10 pump and other ancillary equipment designed to advance our Frac of the Future goals.","Now I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy J. Probert","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide a bit more color on Dave's comments regarding factors impacting our return to prior activity levels and normalized margins in North America.","First the impact of guar. As discussed previously, the rising cost of guar resulted in a headwind of approximately 600 basis points in our North America business in the third quarter. The current crop is anticipated to be 25% to 50% larger than last year, and we foresee a significant improvement in guar costs in 2013 and a restorative tailwind to margins, notwithstanding the fourth quarter activity challenges Dave described earlier.","We've seen rapid adoption of PermStim, one of the game-changing technologies Dave mentioned, which is our high-performance guar replacement. PermStim not only provides an economic alternative to guar, but also provides a vastly improved post-frac cleanup, enabling better flow rates and production when compared with guar systems. On the same Williston pad, for example, production was 20% higher, 150 days post frac, compared with a similar well frac with a guar-based fluid system. In terms of economics, PermStim is highly competitive with guar at current prices, and we believe will offer us a compelling alternative in the event of future guar cost escalation.","The second key factor is customer spending. Our customers have reined in their spending in the back half of the year, resulting in a decline of 172 rigs since the beginning of the year. Spending reductions have been more concentrated in large-cap public companies since the end of the second quarter. And as Dave discussed, this group of customers are indicating to us a return to historical levels of activity in the first quarter as 2013 budgets get underway.","Thirdly, a more favorable balance in the terms of horsepower supply and demand. Some industry horsepower has been parked, and indications are that horsepower additions have slowed dramatically. We retired 2 fleets in the second quarter and a third this quarter and anticipate further fleet retirements in the fourth quarter. As Mark mentioned, any incremental horsepower builds will be directed towards fleet replacement and focus on our Q10 pumps, which are designed to more efficiently handle continuous pumping operations associated with horizontal activity. Q10s have demonstrated an ability to pump twice as many stages as existing pumps before requiring regular maintenance on a spread that requires 25% less horsepower on location. They're a core component for us of our Frac of the Future.","Finally, in a flat-rig count environment, we believe that continued drilling efficiency gains and a rising integration will be key components of improving North America margins. So this suggests to us that excelling at delivering integrated completion services will increasingly become a differentiator in work selection.","Earlier this month, at the SPE Annual Conference, we introduced our industry changing family of software called Knoesis. Designed to improve reservoir knowledge and stimulation characteristics, Knoesis is the industry's first comprehensive and ground-up solution to the challenge of modeling fracture behavior in complex, unconventional reservoirs. This enables our customers to add a further layer of science to the fracture completion portfolio. We're now able to design and forward model fracture completions using 3-dimensional propagation methodologies, which provide previously unavailable insight on fracture planes and the extent of reservoir contact.","The Knoesis suite gives us unparalleled subsurface visualization and design capabilities. So paired with our industry-leading well-site delivery, we believe we're uniquely positioned to provide improved knowledge of the reservoir and its stimulation characteristics to our customers with the singular goal of making better wells.","So while the extent of the North America cycle in 2013 is uncertain, we believe our Frac of the Future initiatives will continue to provide cost benefits and that Knoesis will enable us to materially improve our service intensity, coupled with moderating horseback capacity, reported commodity prices and a guar cost tailwind to our operations, we see these as supportive factors in our goal to return to normalized margins over the course of 2013. Dave?","David J. Lesar","Thank you, Tim. Let me just quickly summarize. We're very proud of our third quarter international results. We continue to gain market share in key markets and expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to be in the upper teens as we exit the year and are optimistic about continued improvement in 2013. In North America, we will not chase the transnational market as we would typically have done but will instead idle our equipment. And overall, we remain very laser-focused on providing industry-leading returns. So we will reduce capital spending as we go into 2013. But our strategy remains intact. We are focused on maintaining our leadership position in North America, continuing to strengthen international margins and grow our market share in deepwater, unconventionals and underserved international markets.","So let's open it up for questions at this point.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies & Company.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess in light of going first, let me try to just make sure I understand some of what you're trying to guide us to. First, maybe a clarification of what you consider to be normalized margins in the U.S. If we're working towards that, how would you think about 2013 evolving? I recognize, of course, in that there are elements to the revenue side you don't see, but let's just -- if you could clarify the normalized margin comment, that would be helpful.","Mark A. McCollum","Well, without giving -- trying to give specific guidance as to when this might happen because that's not what we're doing, we continue to hold that we think normalized margins are in the mid-20s that's -- as we look at the business historically and sort of a balanced market, balanced cost structure, that those mid-20s margins seem to be appropriate to us and that's what we're targeting internally to drive our business forward.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. It makes sense. And the follow-up in the same vein, maybe it's a bit more fourth quarter focused, you all helped us in saying, okay, traditionally, internationally now, you see a modest, what did you say, low-single-digit revenue increase. I actually thought it might have been higher traditionally and then some margin increase. Are you suggesting that from what you can see, the fourth quarter of '12 would be a traditional year? In other words, is that what you're encouraging us to think about for the fourth quarter in non-North America? Or there are some elements that change that?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, no. I think the way that we're looking at it right now and based on our forecast, we're seeing it as a fairly traditional year maybe with a slight bias to the lower end. I mean, obviously, some of the macro headwinds that Dave discussed have continued to be out there. We're watching them very carefully. There seem to be more headwinds than tailwinds in the broad market itself. But as our business is performing and particularly with regard to the share gains that we've had as some of those contracts come in, we think that those things, coupled together, will allow us to post a revenue gain that's in line with what we have traditionally seen. Does that make sense?","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It does.","Mark A. McCollum","In other words, that the broad market may not be up. But with regard to our revenues, because of our share gains, we think that it will look fairly typical.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund [ph] of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","A question. I understand that CapEx being down in 2013 because the current overcapacity in U.S. pressure pumping. But you make comments about unconventional work in China and Australia and, of course, the big deepwater projects that you won and that you're changing. Is CapEx going to continue to be a high number? I mean, are we going to have to continue to invest in this market at the levels close to what we've seen this year? Do we have enough capacity for the international shale boom and the deepwater boom?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, I mean, part of the reason we didn't give specific guidance, Jim, is because it\u2019s something that we're working on. We got to have input from our customers as to what the -- not only the amount, but the timing of their capital spending will be. But -- and I think the other sort of data point to always consider is that we don't build speculative capital. So as we address our capital budget for next year, I mean, I think it is fair to say that there are going to be capital being placed in international markets around unconventionals, around some of the deepwater markets to -- for us to be able to satisfy what our customers are doing on the share wins that we've got and on the projects that we -- they will be doing. We're -- as Dave said, we are focused like lasers on returns right now. We're going to be trying to drive that as carefully as we possibly can. But we do continue to be encouraged about the pace of the development in international and deepwater and unconventionals. The industry as a whole is undercapitalized. I think it's fair to say particularly around unconventionals, we're undercapitalized. And we're going to continue to be working to try to make sure that we have assets on the ground to do that work on a realtime basis.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And the second follow-up, if I could. The international strategic initiative that you talk about, better delivery of technology, closer to supply bases, can you kind of give us a more layman's term as to what it is you're doing to accomplish this? I mean, what the $32 million this quarter was actually spent on so we can better understand what that is?","Mark A. McCollum","There are several different initiatives, Jim, that we're working on. One is we've been completing a fairly significant manufacturing plant in Singapore for our Completion Tools product service line. Our Completion Tools product service line management now resides in Singapore. We're operating that business internationally. And so that's been a fairly significant change and it also, because of the way that we procure, has required subsistent changes to back that up. Secondarily, we still are continuing to work on a project we internally call Battle Red that is associated with our Frac of the Future initiative but really is designed to look at our back office operations, the ordering cash process, the use of mobility, mobile technologies in the field itself to allow our business development, our operations people to be better connected, to move our paper flows more -- to expedite that flow so that we can build faster, be more responsive to customer changes when their -- when work moves as it always does. And that's a fairly significant rollout that requires some changes to SAP, some reorientation of our business support centers. And that change will probably be sort of come to full fruition in the middle part of next year but something that we're spending some ongoing cost around. We're pretty excited about the opportunities that it will hold to reduce our working capital in terms of day sales outstanding and to allow us to improve our service quality as we work with customers. And then the final step really is around other changes that we see, particularly in our Drilling and Evaluation business orients to be more international. We are taking steps with our legal entity organization and other things to be able to expedite that work. And a lot of that relates to moving IP and other things offshore that allows to better utilize that in some of our foreign jurisdictions.","Operator","Our next question comes from James West of Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I could shift back to North America quickly here. Tim you went into some detail, but I want to make sure I caught everything correctly. In your discussions with your customer base, who admittingly is being very disciplined right now and living within their stated 2012 CapEx budgets, as you talked to them about '13, it sounds like they all plan to get back to where they were kind of starting 2012, which is 175 rigs or so higher. Was that -- am I correct to have assumption? And is that what your customers are kind of implying to you at this point?","Timothy J. Probert","I think a couple of points, James. I think -- number one, I think the rate of drilling efficiency in the second half of the year have probably exceeded expectations. And as a result of that, we've seen essentially this construct of many companies essentially running at a budget as we glide in towards the end of the year. And I think as Dave mentioned as well, the combination of that fact plus it's really easy take a little extra time around holiday period as we've seen in past cycles. That, clearly, is contributing to the slowdown. I think the indications we are getting clearly is that we will see that increase as we get into 2013. I don't think we're na\u00efve enough to think that it happens on -- in the first week of January because it won't. So it will be a spaced event as we go through the first quarter. And that's the best year that we have at the moment.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up specifically to pressure pumping, and kind of the pricing dynamics today is market pricing. I understand that you're still rolling over to kind of your new pricing on your contracts, which is still, I believe, at a premium to the market price. Is the market price still going down at this point? Or have we started to stabilize?","Timothy J. Probert","I think that's pretty basin specific. When you sort of break things out a little bit, I mean, if you just kind of look at, say, the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken together, those 3 basins now represent about 50% of the total rig count in the U.S. And you look at the Marcellus, the Barnett, the Haynesville, they're only about 10% of the total rig count today and down about 50% since the beginning of the year. So you can see where the greatest pressures come from that. It's not to say that any basin is immune right now, but basin by basin, there are different pressures. Dry gas, the rig count declines have stabilized there in fact. Wet gas is still coming down and so if you kind of look at the wet gas, dry gas and liquids, the former are the most impacted. So I think I would say that we're starting to see some signs of a bottom. As Dave mentioned, the best sign that you ever see is when you see people, smaller firms operating at EBITDA breakeven. We've certainly seen some indications of that. That usually is the best indicator that pricing is starting to stabilize. And I think you'll gather more information on that over the coming week or so in terms of whether or not that thesis continues from last quarter to this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to shift from rig count to more to a well count level as you mentioned that rigs are becoming more efficient. So maybe it's probably more useful to be focusing on well count now. As you focus on that, on the horizontal well count, how do you see that progressing in the first half of next year versus the second half of this year?","Timothy J. Probert","When we sort of look at the overall sort of rig contracting picture, I mean, clearly, there are a lot of mechanical and SCR rigs that are getting sort of dropped and put on the sideline. The efficiency gains have been quite substantial during the course of this year, but not just in terms of drilling times but also in terms of move times as well. And that, obviously, contributions to, as you mentioned, the higher well count. We've also seen, I think, an increase in the wells and inventory. Dave touched on that a little bit earlier. So it's a little hard to triangulate exactly what the picture looks like at this moment. But I don't see any change next year in terms of the drive towards drilling efficiency. I think the biggest gains have probably been realized. But we're a very innovative industry and we'll keep pushing for -- to reduce days to debt. So as we get back into next year, I think we'd kind of start where we left off and then we'll continue to see incremental gains that are arguably not quite as significant as we saw this year.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then secondly on service intensity, do you see service intensity still increasing? Or has it now become kind of leveled off or even falling as we look forward in 2013?","Timothy J. Probert","Yes, I think we do see service intensity increasing. As we've said a couple of times, the first battle here has been all around service efficiency. I feel that as a company, we've got that well positioned and as a -- from the example I was giving you regarding our new pumping systems some significant benefits. They are not just in terms of operating cost but in terms of capital deployment, too, which is very important to us. But the next inning really is all about subsurface efficiency. It's about making better wells. And we've been in a scramble as an industry to get work done for a couple of years. Now it's about applying the science to the subsurface, making better wells and becoming a lot more efficient not just in the oily basins, but in the gassy basins too.","Mark A. McCollum","Just a follow-up on that, I mean, I think as we look ahead, we're not trying to build our plan just around service intensity growth and sort of relying on that. As Dave said, we think that the ultimate differentiator is going to be those guys that can be the lowest cost service provider. So we're very, very keenly focused on reducing our footprint, our operating cost, bringing down our internal cost so that ultimately, our realization on a per stage or per well goes up regardless of what happens on the service intensity side.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So to that point, the Frac of the Future, where are you in that the implementation phase? And when do we start to see the benefits of the lower cost?","Timothy J. Probert","We're in the rollout phase today. And obviously, we have a large existing fleet. And so we have to implement enough Frac of the Future fleets to ensure that we sort of impact the overall balance. So we'll start to see some impacts during 2013. The bulk of the impacts though probably will be more felt in 2014.","Mark A. McCollum","We do have some of the Frac of the Future fleets that are out there operating, and the early results are quite dramatic. We've got -- we were very pleased.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.","David Anderson","So we've been hearing a lot of talk about E&Ps using up their 2012 CapEx budgets and I guess on the one hand, I guess there's a first for everything. But it's pretty unusual, considering these guys are cash flow driven and WTI is above $90. So I'm just wondering. It seems to take a lot of the weaker activity levels. It's really about looking to drive down cost through lower service pricing. Now obviously, in mind, Dave you just made a pretty big change there in your strategies and you're not seeking full utilization anymore. So should I be reading this? Or should we be reading this as basically you guys drawing a line in the sand and saying this is as far as we're going to go on pricing and we're not going to the devalue our services anymore compared to one-dimensional players?","David J. Lesar","I guess that's a great way to summarize it, Dave. As I indicated, one of the lessons we learned coming out of the last dip is that chasing the transactional market essentially sets the lowest common denominator for pricing. And it's that point that you have to then battle uphill on getting prices increases out of. And so our view is that, that is a relatively transitory market for us to chase into given the percentage of 24-hour crews we have. Therefore, we are not going to chase into it this time. We're not going to lower our prices to get that work, therefore, giving us a higher baseline to move forward when some of these other issues get out of the way. So yes, that is a strategy change and one that ultimately, I think, will be successful and it's just a lesson that we learned from the past.","David Anderson","Okay. Now you're talking about transitory weakness in North America and it's going to last only a few quarters. What are some of the signs or at least what are some of the drivers that you're looking for? I mean, are you kind of looking at kind of 3 or 4 things talking about pressure pumping fleet attrition, you talked kind of some of the laying down, but do you need to see industry attrition levels, higher? Is it improvement of national gas rig count? Is it E&P cost coming down? Or is it kind of these emerging basins absorbing capacity? What do you think are kind of the couple of the key drivers? Or at least a couple of the signs that you're going to -- that you're pointing towards?","Mark A. McCollum","David, remember that about 80% to 85% of our fleet is contracted, right? So the key thing that we're looking for is customer budgets, an announcement that they're getting back to work. As we're looking we think about this transitory issue, we're talking about in Q4, they use up their budget and they're basically taking time off to coast into the end of the year. And so the key thing we'll be looking for is when are they are going to be starting backup and when could we get our crews back to work? And that takes up a -- the vast majority of the issue around what we're looking for. The second thing, obviously, will be then watching the rig count overall as it begins to leak up. As you commented, I think it's not the commodity price. The commodity price environment, particularly on the oil side, has been supportive. And we've seen near -- on an absolute basis a 6% reduction in the U.S. land rig count since the end of June in spite of that. And so that's why this feels so transitory and really budget related. And going into next year, many of the contract rollovers, customers have all suggested at least in their initial indicators that they're going to do want -- they're going to do more work, they\u2019ll be running more rigs and asking for more equipment on our side. And so we feel, on a long-term basis, pretty good about what 2013 might hold.","David Anderson","And when do you start having those conversations? Is that kind of a December conversation for January, is that how we think about it?","Mark A. McCollum","Happening now.","David J. Lesar","Still happening right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question I would have, you guys indicated here that you're able to maybe offset some of the reduction in frac activity by pulling through other services. That seems like a very familiar refrain from other downturns that typically tend to be transitory. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of product launch you're able to pull through and whether or not that pull-through on a go-forward basis is going to be a substantial factor in helping you get back to that normalized margin? Or is that normalized margin one thing -- I\u2019m coming back to what you said earlier, is that primarily just frac utilization? Can you just give us some color around that?","Timothy J. Probert","Yes, I think the first comment there probably, Kurt, is around pricing in general. I think just to sort of clarify a little bit. I mean, the pricing issues that we have today are primarily around stimulation. So you saw the D&E results. They were good for North America improvement in margins off the Q. And I think as we've touched on, there is clearly -- anything that directly touches frac may have a little more pressure than those things that don't touch frac. So I think the first point is that there is a real opportunity to pull through elements which do not today have significant pricing pressure. I think that's point number one. And with respect to the pull-through, obviously, anytime that you renegotiate, you're looking for some opportunity to improve your longer-term position. You've heard it from us before. It's something that we tend to focus, on and those product lines typically would be around completions, would be around wireline, would be around coil, just to give a few examples of areas where we would really sort of push to, to try and improve the pull through.","Mark A. McCollum","Okay. Let me just add. Kurt, as you're thinking about the normalized margins, as we think about our North America margins or at least our U.S. margins right now, they're not us as far off as I think that the average margin indicates, right? We've described that guar is about 600 basis points of margin impact on us. When you eliminate that, that comes back to us substantially. We're back above 20%. We also think that we probably lost a little under 100 basis points of margin this quarter just on activity and mix as a result of the declining rig count over the course of the quarter. And so it doesn't take that much movement for us to sort of begin to threaten those normalized margins as we've talked about them with some repair on the market.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. I was wondering, David, if you can make -- give us an update on how you think things are progressing in Iraq and what you think the outlook is in general for Saudi and Iraq heading out into 2013.","David J. Lesar","I think first with Saudi, I think it's a good news story. We like our position there. We've had additional rigs added to our south guar project. That one is going very, very well, Manitha [ph] the rig count is up on that project. As I indicated, we've just added a stimulation vessel into the market. We have been assigned a geographic area in Saudi to try to demonstrate that we can make unconventionals work there in some of their tight gas area. So that market is very good for us right now and potentially even better as we go into the next couple of years. Iraq is certainly, for us, a lot better than it was last year, where we were struggling with some contracts. We are getting through those at this point in time. And as I indicated and Mark indicated, the financial results are better. It is still a very difficult market to operate in. And the size of projects and the contract structure basically creates a bidding frenzy around them, which means that everybody is bidding those things fairly thinly. But we've got good infrastructure on the ground. We're committed to that marketplace. We just have to work our way through some of the contracts that we did have some issues with. But we're very optimistic about that market also.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Mark, could you just review with us exactly how the mechanics of the guar cost recovery work? I mean, I understand the fact that you guys are turning very some high cost inventory and haven't necessarily been able to pass that through. On a guar cost markdown, with regard to raw material cost input into the job, will the client expect to receive some of that? Or because they didn't get it, they didn't have to pay for it in the first place? You get to keep it? How does that work, I mean, mechanically?","Mark A. McCollum","Yes, essentially, guar is our cost, right. It's an input cost into the work that we do. As our guys have been in the market bidding, we know that we have a higher cost average -- higher average cost of guar. They have substantially tried to ignore that. So that they remain competitive. And as a result of that, to the extent that our inflation is above the market, we've just taken that straight on the chin. And as we look ahead, with the crop yield being 20% to 50% higher next year, we're already beginning to see sort of current pricing of guar in the market beginning to fall, the success of the PermStim rollout and what it's being able to achieve for customers and the demand that we're seeing in terms of its growth, we feel like that will not only be able to kind of get ourselves back to as we normally would on supply chain side, be it sort of the most favored nations price that's out there in the market, but also probably have some ability to value price the PermStim offering going into next year as we get more and better results from its use.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","But on the lower cost guar is like getting contractually to your customers.","Mark A. McCollum","Is that [indiscernible]?","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes.","Mark A. McCollum","Let me kind of give you an example. Our stimulation pricing is generally on a per stage basis. Let's say, we charge $100 first day. I mean, it's obviously a lot more than that. But let's say $100 as an example, of which, let's say, $0.50 of that -- there are $50 of that $100 is materials that are consumed and that includes our guar cost today. As Tim said, there's about 600 basis points in that. So what we would expect is our $50 of material to go down to $44 of material or whatever the math would work out. So therefore, the customer doesn't see the increase as they came through and won't see the decline as it goes out.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. And then with regard to, again, timing, we would expect to see the headwind become a tailwind when? Q2 of next year?","Mark A. McCollum","Well, I mean I think our hope is that we're going to be really working through a lot of our inventories, getting it down in normalized levels toward the end of this year or early next. I mean, the variable in this is to what extent activity falters in Q4 because we've sort of known fairly closely what our usage is and where that's going, and then also how much PermStim. PermStim has been growing significantly as a substitute product that can also cost some of the guar inventory leak over into Q1 if we don't use it. But having done that, we think that really, we're going to start new purchases of the new crop year at the end of the year and that will begin to influence the average cost in our inventories quite dramatically. And so hopefully, by the time we get out of Q1, no matter what happens, we'll have this guar issue behind us, back to market levels.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lance Loeffler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lance Loeffler - Halliburton Co.","Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2017 conference call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President; and Robb Voyles, Interim CFO. As mentioned on our last quarterly call, due to a long-standing business commitment, Dave Lesar, Halliburton's Chairman and CEO, will not be present this morning but will return for our second quarter call.","Today, Jeff will be providing market and operational commentary; and Robb will discuss our quarterly financial results. As a reminder, from our fourth quarter earnings call, we have changed the reporting for our divisions in geographic regions consistent with our major peer. In doing so, we will now provide revenue and profit for our divisions and revenue only for our four geographic regions: North America; Latin America; Europe\/Africa\/CIS; and Middle East\/Asia.","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events.

I'm thankful to the Halliburton team around the world for their consistent execution and for collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers in every single market where we operate.","Now, following our operational update a few weeks ago, the quarter wrapped up in line with what we expected. Our highlights for the quarter were total company revenue of $4.3 billion, representing a 6% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. I'm pleased that our U.S. land revenue increased by nearly 30%, outperforming the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 27%. And total North America revenue was up 24% sequentially, significantly outperforming our largest peer. Latin America revenue grew in excess of 8% sequentially, outperforming what is typically a seasonal decline following year-end product sales.","Operating income was $203 million, primarily driven by improving market conditions in North America, which were partially offset by activity declines and pricing pressure internationally. We completed the early redemption of $1.4 billion of senior notes during the quarter using cash on hand, reducing both leverage and interest expense going forward.","As we described in our operational update, the market is a tale of two cycles. North America activity increased rapidly but not without growing pains, while activity in the rest of the world declined due to typical seasonal pressures that were exacerbated by current cyclical headwinds. In North America, the first quarter brought a lot of change, both to our strategy and our customers' view of the market. And I love the way the market is shaping up. I'm excited because customers are investing to meet production targets; pricing is moving; supply versus demand dynamics are tight; our reactivated equipment is going to work at leading-edge pricing, and we are working to manage our input costs.","So, we said we would outgrow the U.S. land market, and we did. The cost and benefits of our reactivation program continue as we march into the second quarter. And to be crystal clear, we're adding reactivated equipment at market-leading prices to stabilize market share. At the same time, we're repairing margins in the rest of the portfolio. North America incremental margins improved throughout the quarter in spite of absorbing transitory inflation costs, reactivation costs, and typical seasonal declines in the Gulf of Mexico. In short, our first quarter results reflect that we are not chasing market share at the cost of pricing.","Our strategy to deliver industry-leading returns is at the center of everything we do. We see the path to normalized margins and know it's better to invest now to maintain hard-earned market share, so that when we earn normalized margins, it will be on a bigger base of business. We still think this is the smart choice and the right choice. While production increases could moderate the pace of activity increases in the second half of the year, we see sufficient demand for the equipment we're bringing into the market.","As we look at the second half of the year, we'll assess our options for continued redeployment beyond our current plans, but have made no decisions. Because we build our own equipment, we have the unique luxury to wait longer than our competitors to make any new build decisions. We believe that the industry's active fleet of pumping equipment is fully utilized. And we know from our own experience, as we get near the bottom of the stacked equipment pile, it will be progressively harder and more expensive for the industry to reactivate equipment.","Our experience through many cycles is that when this happens, we see a customer flight to quality due to their strong desire to make better wells and reduce their cost per BOE. Let me reiterate, we foresee increased demand for new build equipment, but will not consider responding to this demand until the economics make sense.","What's important is that we see multiple paths to normalized margins, and we'll maintain optionality to travel the path that gets us there the fastest with the highest market share. The following factors influence our decision on which path to choose: determining where and how we add equipment at leading-edge pricing; chasing price up, not down; evaluating, winding up, and repairing pricing on older contracts, this is happening every day; aligning with customers that are racing to meet production targets or will work with us to maximize our collective efficiency; managing our input costs; and finally, a relentless focus on reducing internal costs and implementing technology.","Outside of North America, our more conservative outlook for the last several quarters is proving accurate. Our customers around the world have different breakeven thresholds and production requirements, but none are immune to the impacts of the current commodity price environment. We continue to see customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Now due to lower cash flow and project economics, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs. The result of this combination is less activity and more pricing pressure.","Now I believe the first quarter represents the bottom in the Eastern Hemisphere rig count. The full-year average for 2017 will likely only be marginally higher than the full-year average for 2016. Further, due to the long-term contractual nature of international markets and the level of continuing price pressure, I expect discounts will offset activity gains over the near term.","In Latin America, we saw sequential improvement in revenue from activity in Brazil and Mexico in the first quarter. Now while we're seeing an improvement in certain basins, there are a variety of country-specific headwinds that must be overcome for a meaningful recovery in the region.","In contrast to North America, where we believe that a $50 oil price would drive a significant increase in activity, customers tell me that longer duration international markets will react less to an absolute oil price but more to a positive view of where price will be for several years. This isn't a surprise given the longer investment cycle that many of our customers face.","To sum it up, in North America the momentum is building, and we only see it getting better. And we believe we've seen the bottom in the international market.","Now I'll turn the call to Robb to cover our financial results.","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning.","Let's start with a summary of our first quarter results compared sequentially to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, representing an increase of 6%, while operating income was $203 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in our North America land business, offset by the typical seasonal impact in the international markets that were exacerbated by the cyclical headwinds that Jeff described earlier.","Now let me compare our divisional results to the fourth quarter of 2016. In our Completion and Production division, first quarter revenue increased by 15% while operating income increased 73%. These results were primarily driven by improved pressure pumping pricing and utilization in our U.S. land business, offset by a seasonal decline in completion tool sales across the Eastern Hemisphere and the Gulf of Mexico.","Turning to our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income declined by 4% and 51% respectively, primarily as a result of reduced software sales as well as lower pricing and decreased fluid sales across the Middle East-Asia region.","Let me take a minute to compare our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 24% sequentially, primarily driven by increased pricing and activity in our pressure pumping and well construction product service lines. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 8%, primarily due to increased activity in well completion, fluid services, and production solutions in Brazil, as well as pressure pumping, fluid services, and project management in Mexico.","Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue declined 11%, resulting primarily from reduced activity in West Africa and weather-related activity reductions in the North Sea and Russia. For Middle East-Asia, revenue declined 12% as a result of reduced pricing and activity across the region, particularly completion tool sales, project management, and drilling services.","Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $66 million in the first quarter, and we anticipate that our corporate expenses will be a similar amount for the second quarter of 2017.","In March 2017, we redeemed $1.4 billion of our senior notes with cash on hand. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $104 million on the early extinguishment of debt, which included the redemption premium and a write-off of the remaining original debt issuance costs and debt discount, partially offset by a gain from the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. This loss on the early debt extinguishment is included in the $242 million of interest expense for the first quarter. As a function of our reduced debt balance, we expect net interest expense for the second quarter to be approximately $120 million, a savings of close to $20 million. This savings will continue in future quarters.","We reported $18 million of other expenses for the quarter. This was lower than we anticipated due to lower volatility associated with foreign exchange movements during the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly higher than expected at approximately 27%, due to a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. For the remainder of 2017, we are expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 29% to 30%.","Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $5 million, which represents $340 million of cash flow from operations, excluding the final Macondo payment. And we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents. As we progress through 2017, we believe we are well-positioned to generate significantly more cash from operations.","Turning now to our near-term operational outlook. Market dynamics continue to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the second quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating a second quarter rebound from typical seasonal weather disruptions in drilling activity, such that sequential revenue will experience a mid-single-digit increase compared to first quarter levels, with margins increasing 75 basis points to 125 basis points. In our Completion and Production division, we believe that revenues will increase in the upper teens, while margins will increase by 275 basis points to 325 basis points.","As for our regional outlook, as in the first quarter, we expect our revenue growth in North America to outperform the average U.S. land rig count growth, which is already up significantly for the second quarter. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues will increase sequentially by mid-single digits. We expect Europe\/Africa\/CIS revenues to increase by low-double digits as a result of increased activity after the winter months. And we believe Middle East\/Asia revenue will remain relatively flat sequentially.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for a technology review and a few closing comments. Jeff?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","As I said earlier, our strategy is to deliver leading shareholder returns. That shapes all of the decisions that we make. We work closely with our customers, and what we do is clearly aligned with what's most important to them, delivering oil and gas at the lowest cost per BOE, even more so in what is a challenging commodity price environment.","We execute our strategy with three main levers, and those levers are: people; capital investment; and technology. Each is pointed towards generating leading returns. Our people collaborate, listen and use a broad range of technology to engineer solutions. I know this is working, because it wins with our customers. We have leading service quality that translates into larger work allocations and contract awards, which ultimately result in higher market share.","Our capital investment strategy is absolutely focused on the things that competitively differentiate us. For example, we are always developing solutions that drive capital off location and make us more efficient. In hydraulic fracturing, we already make the most efficient pumps and have the most efficient surface configuration. What you probably don't know is that we're doing the same thing in all other parts of our business. For example, our subsea intervention systems are more compact. Our rotary coring tool is the ultra-deepwater market leader; and our state-of-the-art completions tools manufacturing allow us to design and deliver lower-cost tools. We have continuous improvement initiatives across all of the company to maximize the efficiency of our capital investment.","From a mergers and acquisitions perspective, we're interested in acquiring businesses and technologies that enhance the depth of our product line portfolio or breadth of our offering in specific areas, such as production chemicals and artificial lift. As we're a returns-focused company, we do not want to get into product lines that we believe would be dilutive to our return profile, such as subsea equipment. There are good companies in this industry segment that we can partner with to provide those capabilities to our customers without diluting our returns.","Our customers are more open to technology adoption than ever before and continuously engage with us to help direct our technology investment. I believe that technology is valuable when it satisfies two criteria: first, it meets the customer requirement; and then, second, it provides a return to Halliburton. We look for technology and equipment that differentiates us from our competitors, helps our customers, and drives our returns. If it doesn't, we'd rather rent it than own it or partner with an expert in that field. We believe differentiated technology and ability to integrate technology using an open-architecture approach is what sets us apart from our competitors, helps our customers, and drives returns.","Through the downturn, we've been very active, deepening those investments and relationships that we believe offer the best full-cycle returns. Our competitive technology position is demonstrated by our onshore market leadership in North America and our contract awards and share gains in what are historically some of the most technology-driven markets, such as deepwater exploration with openhole wireline and testing; deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where Halliburton now enjoys an overall market leadership position; and, finally, in the Middle East, where we have a market leadership position in project management. The feedback from our customers has been overwhelming. We're aligned with what's most important to them, maximizing asset value, and doing so with our proven commitment to execution service quality and technology.","Now, because we provided an operational update a month ago, we have a few spare minutes today to cover topics we don't normally have time to discuss. I hear a lot of discussion in the industry today about digital initiatives, for example, big data, analytics, Internet of Things, and automation. And I'd like to share my views on the subject.","Let's start with the underlying concept. Our industry challenges remain the same, but today, we have an opportunity to solve problems in a fundamentally different way, enabled by the development of reliable, inexpensive sensors, data processing capabilities in the cloud, and advances in machine learning techniques. Now, digital technologies are valuable, only when they solve a problem. The value is created by the combination of domain expertise with digital technologies. Arguably, the most popular talking point is big data. Now, big data standing alone is nothing but big data collection. It's really only valuable when used for automation and optimization.","To me, the big data story is still being written. We collect different E&P data types, and because Landmark's DecisionSpace is the go-to platform for the industry, we power the collection and storage of big data more so than anyone else. Our customers use DecisionSpace to collect, monitor, analyze, and sometimes control their assets through the life of the field. Each customer is unique and will have specific goals. The open-architecture platform we provide allows customization and enables customers to use their domain expertise to its fullest advantage.","Let me give you some other examples of what digital looks like at Halliburton, starting with the direct application of these innovations to help customers lower their cost per BOE. In the production space, we're a leader in smart fields, with Voice of the Oilfield, where digital technologies are combined with subsurface understanding to optimize production.","In the Eastern Hemisphere, we have completed the first phase of the smart field project in heavy oil. The project included modeling, automated workflows, and optimizing production and injection networks. This is made possible by the incorporation of new data sources into an analytical framework. This allowed our customer to have a constant view of their facilities, reservoir, and operations to monitor and optimize production in real-time. This project has substantially reduced the cost of production, and the process is now being implemented on a series of fields with over 1,000 wells. We have similar projects ongoing with major operators in deepwater as well as unconventionals.","In hydraulic fracturing, we continue to innovate and push the envelope by automating the fracturing process. This is accomplished by acquiring data from frac treatments in real-time and applying machine learning to make decisions previously taken by on-site personnel, such as rate or pressure adjustments, and volume, and timing the release of materials. As a result, we've seen dramatic improvements in fracture efficiencies in the field.","We have similar efforts ongoing in our Drilling and Completion arenas, which I'm excited about and will share details about at a later date. Internally, we are far along in rolling out various digital initiatives. For example, in the area of condition-based maintenance, over 90% of our pumps are equipped with IntelliScan, advanced sensors and algorithms to measure and monitor pump health in real-time.","In summary, our industry is in the very early stages of defining the digital story. We believe an open digital architecture is a prerequisite for our industry to enable faster innovation and collaboration with our customers. This is why we've invested in and standardized on the industry's only open-standards-based platform, DecisionSpace. We're excited to open up access to this platform code through OpenEarth, a community of E&P scientists and developers, to speed up and lower the cost of digital innovation for the entire industry.","In closing, there are a few things that I want to highlight. We are the execution company, and I'm excited by the activity I see in North America. We outperformed the U.S. land rig count in North America and expect to do so again in the second quarter. As we stated on our operational update, we've nearly doubled our reactivated equipment additions for the full year and are bringing that equipment out in the first six months of the year. Our conservative international view is playing out, and I am confident in our ability to handle the challenges in these markets. We are focused on achieving industry-leading returns, and I believe we have the best strategy to achieve that.","Now let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great and thanks. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Good morning, Dave.","David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So I was just wondering. So with a strong catch-up in completion activity that you saw on U.S. land this quarter, is it fair to say you think we're entering a new completion-intensive phase of this cycle? And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you see that relationship between rigs and completion activity now. You had previously talked about 900 being the new 2,000 in terms of full industry utilization. I was just wondering if you could go into that math a little bit and see if that's adjusted at all.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Thanks, Dave. There's no doubt that the pace of completions activity is catching up with the rig count, and we expect to see that relationship continue into next quarter most certainly. And it is partly around \u2013 the increasing intensity continues to build. And when I said 900 was the new 2,000, I probably overshot that number in a sense that we are seeing that kind of tightness in the marketplace today.","David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And as a related, as we're talking about preserving market share that you've talked about and reactivating it, clearly you did this. I've seen some of this capacity from smaller competitors out there. There are two questions around that. I guess one, what do you think are the biggest impediments for the industry bringing this back? Do you think there's going to be shortages of repair? Is it finding and training crews? Is it something else? And secondarily, you had talked in your prepared remarks about a flight to quality. I was just wondering if we're starting to see that yet. Are customers starting to experience the poor jobs or equipment delivery delays, or is that a little bit further out?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Look, the flight to quality is happening, and that is what we see when equipment comes into the market. And most importantly, as clients get urgent, reliability, service quality, and technology even matter more. And so we are confident that that pivot to what we deliver will continue through the marketplace.","As far as things that are tight, equipment broadly is tight I think for the industry today. Sand is one of those things that will recover in terms of availability. There's a lot of capacity coming into the market. And then from a people perspective, we're confident with where we are on people. And it is partly because we retained our folks, our most experienced people through the downturn, and we know how to hire folks. We hired 21,000 in 2014.","David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Good morning, Jim.","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","Good morning, Jim.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I actually heard an advertisement on the radio the other day here in Dallas for a Halliburton job fair in Abilene. So that's the first time I've heard that, so I guess your hiring efforts are going farther afield than Midland.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Yes.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","The Gulf of Mexico, my sources are telling me, Jeff, that you guys have just won some work from Chevron and Shell in the Gulf of Mexico that previously had been held by a competitor. And you guys are a little bit smaller in the Gulf of Mexico than your nearest competitor. And I was wondering if you could tell us if this is true, who it is, and how did you do it?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","I'm not going to tell you about customers, but I think we know what the customer set is in the Gulf of Mexico. Yes, we've been quite successful in the Gulf of Mexico, and it's really built around our strategy, Jim. It's collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers, so we're clearly focused on the things that are important to them. And the other thing I think it tells you is that our technology portfolio is extremely competitive. And I think we've demonstrated that by what we're doing in deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico and in other places.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And if I could follow up on the U.S., you guys said in your operational update that you're definitely accelerating pressure pumping capacity. Would it be fair to say that in Q3, you'd probably have about twice as much pressure pumping capacity in the field than you had on January 1? And I know that new contracts are getting a big price hike. I think you all confirmed something close to 25% for Q1. Would all the equipment you have in the field be benefiting from that higher price by say Q3?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Jim, I think the amount of equipment that we're adding is not nearly as much as you're suggesting. But what I will tell you is that we are working constantly on the broader portfolio. And without giving you a time, we actually have seen quite a bit of progress on that since the beginning of the year. I can't predict precisely what that timing is, but the right things are happening. And I'd say that in the sense of customer urgency, we're seeing that supply and demand tightness. And the bottom line is we really like the way the market's shaping up. I think we're on that path.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I guess what I'm really asking though is that, I know that new fleets are going to work at a nice price hike from where we were, say, exiting Q4, but the equipment that you already had in the field in Q4, how long does it take before the new prices for new equipment, how long before that price hike hits all the legacy activity and equipment you already have in the field, how long should that take to flow through?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Again, that should happen over the next, I would say, four quarters, somewhere in that range depending on pace and efficiency of customers. But it's something that gets done in due course as contracts roll over, or we move things around. So we kind of control the when, and the where, and the how. We work on that every day, Jim.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Is this new equipment going to work on contract, or just more like commitment?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Jim, everyone would like to commit equipment at this point in the marketplace. I think we're being very thoughtful about where we place equipment. We are aligned with the right customers, we believe, in the right markets. But we also move equipment around, and that's part of where we see the flight to quality happen as we move equipment around.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","James West - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, guys.","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Good morning.","James West - Evercore ISI","Jeff, as you think about the second half of the year in North America, given all the equipment you've put back to work and the pricing power that you're achieving now, what do you see as the momentum of North American margins going forward? I know we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, but incremental margins were, as you have talked about previously, light this quarter, but they should, in my mind, at least explode in the back half. Is that a fair assessment? I mean, when you're running your models and you're thinking about your earnings power here for North America, what do you see?","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","Jim, this is Robb. I'm not sure about what you would characterize explosion, but...","James West - Evercore ISI","Fair enough, Robb.","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","...this is a transition quarter for us in terms of how we're reporting our operating income in areas. But given that it is a transition, and given the way North America's rapidly expanding, what I can say is that margins improved throughout the quarter, and that our exit incrementals for North America approximated what we'd anticipated for the whole quarter. We really like the momentum that we see going into the second quarter, and we fully anticipate that momentum to continue throughout the year.","James West - Evercore ISI","Okay, okay. That's helpful, Robb. Thanks. And Robb and Jeff, I saw you guys about what, five, six weeks ago or so and at that time, we were starting to talk about new build capacity. And Jeff, I believe, that you had indicated that you would probably make that call as we got closer to kind of mid-year. I suspect you and Robb, too, probably have Jim Brown in your office every day asking for CapEx and trying to build new equipment. So how are you thinking about that right now? And how are you thinking about when you make that decision to start adding incremental capacity, think about new builds to the market?","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","Well, fortunately, Jim Brown lives in Denver, and he can't be in our office.","James West - Evercore ISI","Sorry calling you, yeah.","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","Well, we also have the call ID, so we don't always answer the phone. But I think what we were trying to make clear in our prepared remarks is that we have not made that decision yet. We're constantly monitoring the situation, looking closely at capacity in the marketplace, our customer relationships and what their demands are. Bottom line is we're not going to be bringing new build equipment into the market unless and until we see the kind of margins that we want to achieve, and that's normalized margins and a good return on that equipment.","We're fortunate, as you know, in that we manufacture our own equipment. And so we've got a lot of optionality in that area, and we can react rapidly when we need to. But at this point, we're comfortable with where we are, and we've not made any decisions on new builds.","James West - Evercore ISI","Okay, fair enough. All right, thanks, Robb.","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks. Good morning. So on the guidance, it looks like the incremental for the second quarter for CPS is in the vicinity of like 25%. And I'm just curious as to when you conducted your call of a few weeks back on the operational update, Dave talked about aspirational North America margins over the course of the next several quarters and then a couple of years in the 20% arena. And in order to do that, we had to land kind of a sort of glide path of 40% to 45% sequential incrementals for several quarters. And I'm just curious, with regard to CPS, I think you guys had an 18% incremental Q1, a guided 25% incremental for Q2. And relative to that aspired 40% to 45% North American incremental, what do CPS incrementals have to be in order to land that 20% North America margin?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Bill, I think the outlook we gave on the operational update is accurate. But without a precise number, what we need to do is continue to put the equipment to work that we have in the marketplace. And I expect that we will be on a glide path that will materialize over the balance of the year that take us to what those normalized margins are and should be seeing that reflected as we, again, move through the second half of the year and into next year.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. And just my takeaway from the call a few weeks back is that what was burdening your incrementals was a combination of insufficient net pricing traction, one; second, ramp-up and reactivation friction; and third, supply chain cost inflation. And I'm just curious as if you could talk briefly about each of those with regard to how we're evolving, and sort of progressing, and transcending those challenges, and what we can expect.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","So with respect to bringing equipment back out, I mean, we laid out the path to these assets through sort of mid-year. And at that point, that burden is behind us. With respect to supply chain, and we were working on that every single day, that in many ways, the short-term supply shortages that were at least generated by year-end activity should begin to abate as we move through Q2. This is sand shortages. And so those are the most prominent couple of items that come under control as we move through the year.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","And with regard to net pricing traction, I think, an earlier questioner said 25% on new equipment rolling out. Is that correct? And what kind of pricing traction are you getting with regard to equipment in the field currently working?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Yes. I mean, there's great momentum. So we talked about moving up at the leading edge, but we're seeing pricing improvement in every basin where we work around North America. And as I said, on the legacy portfolio, it is getting traction. And as we work that every day, again, it is making progress. And we expect that, that momentum continues as we work through the year.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Good morning.","Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I want to follow on from Bill's question. I think we all understand that margins should improve nicely in the second half of the year as these restart costs fade, but do you need additional pricing to reach those 20% plus normalized margins in North America, or can you get there through the repricing of active spreads and reaching full utilization? I realize you're not going to be reporting geomarket margins anymore, but conceptually, color on this point, I think would help us all forecast.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Yes, so we would expect to continue to make pricing gains. But with that said, there are a lot of other levers that we have once we start to move the full portfolio up on pricing, and that's where we start to get into the customer urgency that we're seeing, which then leads to hyper-utilization. As the excess capacity comes out of the marketplace, we get a lot more control over the calendar, some would call that calendar power, and we don't have all of that today. But I think all of those things conspire to a path to normalized margins that is somewhat dependent on price to the degree it repairs the portfolio. But if we think back to 2014, as we were moving up that chain, we nearly never got to what I would call the pricing power piece of that, but it was more around utilization.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. So just to be clear, you would need some incremental pricing above and beyond leading edge to get to those normalized margins? Is that fair?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Yeah, I mean, some at leading edge but, more importantly, repairing the broader portfolio.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And just a follow-up on strategy. We heard from your largest competitor on Friday regarding their strategy to enter various aspects of the value chain in North America. Can you provide an update regarding your strategy toward investing across the value chain and broader integration in North America? Has anything changed as some of the different links in that chain start to tighten?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","No. I mean, we want to invest in those things where we believe we add unique value to them, so clearly, that's our equipment, and the kind of technology we can roll out to make that more efficient. As we look up and down the value chain, we try to be fairly surgical about those things that we think we need to own, one of those being the logistics piece of that, just because it's quite portable, actually, in terms of where sand is at any point in time. We don't have that experience, but our view of owning the actual commodity is that sand is rarely in the right place or is at the right mesh size. Those tastes change over time, and so that's not a place where we want to put a lot of capital.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it, appreciate the color.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Good morning, Angie.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","So Jeff, going back to the construction comments that you made in your prepared remarks and the Q&A here, you said that given that you build in-house, you can wait longer before you start to build. Can you give us a little perspective of your construction time for that equipment? And has the cost structure changed from building this cycle versus the last cycle?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","I would say that we've seen the cost come down somewhat around the cost of building equipment. As we look out at what's available or what we can do in the marketplace, I think also some of that's our own value engineering as we think about how we take cost out of things and still achieve the same effective market-leading equipment.","With respect to timing, I'm not going to give you the precise timing, but it is going to be faster than anyone else, simply because we control that part of the value chain in our manufacturing facility. And that allows us to make no decision, certainly at this time. And I think we can wait fairly deep into the cycle before we make any kind of decision about whether or not we bring out new equipment.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then on the cost pass-throughs, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought a third of your sand that you're purchasing on the spot market. And can you talk about the lag in passing through the cost to your customers? And are you seeing any challenges, at least maybe on your legacy equipment on getting the cost pass-throughs fully redeemed?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Look, that's very competitive in terms around how we work with each of our customers, and they're different. What we do see is a path to manage inflation. And I do think in addition to that, some element of that inflation will abate as we get into the later half of the year.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then finally on pricing, besides frac and maybe directional drilling, are you seeing pricing gains in any other product lines?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","We are seeing pricing gains in the well construction service lines. However, those never fell quite as far, and so I don't think they have as far to move back up. But we are seeing, certainly, tightness in some of those service lines.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, great. Thanks, I'll turn it over.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to just touch base on your international outlook. Jeff, you mentioned in your comments something regarding operator budgets. The absolute oil price may be not as important as perception on stability and where it's going to be for the next several quarters. If we're in a $50 to $55 world for an extended period, what is your sense on, number one, how international revenue would progress? But then also how do we think about your margins in that environment as well? It sounds like price pressure continues in certain areas. Can you maybe talk about revenue outlook in a low to mid-$50 type environment, and how we could think about your international margins perhaps over the back half of the year and maybe on a longer-term basis?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","I think what we see is the stress in that part of the market is simply a cost piece of the issue. And so how do we bring cost down to make a lot of those plays more competitive? And I think our customers are working on that now, but doesn't change the macro view that as North America is more competitive, where does that put some of these other markets? And our strategy is working with our customers, but it works slowly and in terms of bringing that cost down.","So as we look out, I think it will be muted in a range-bound world, that deepwater will be the slowest to come back. I think there is room to move around in the mature fields, and I think those will recover probably ahead of that in terms of activity, which is what we're seeing through the balance of the year. But it is very competitive given the amount of equipment that is out around the world today.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, thanks for that. And just to follow up on that, as we think about your international businesses, do you have other levers you could pull if revenue outlook is perhaps flat for a period and you make that determination? Do you have other levers you can pull to get your international margins higher to adjust for a new normal, if it comes to that?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Yes, we do. We are constantly working on continuous improvement initiatives that take cost out of not only the business but also out of the equipment that we use. There are all kinds of breakthroughs as we look at how to make things work more effectively. When I talk about our value proposition and how we collaborate and engineer solutions, a lot of that is how do we systematically take cost out of what we do, which ultimately improves our margins.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just my follow-up is on North America. It's been asked a little bit, and I wanted to try take it from a different angle. If I were to think about your portfolio today in the U.S. in pressure pumping, is there a way to think about, I don't know, what percentage would be at leading-edge pricing, and then trying to think about how much is still under legacy pricing if I were to think about where it is today?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Look, it's moving all of the time. So I'm really not, from a competitive standpoint, sharing with you where we are specifically. What I will tell you is that it's all moving up but in different paces, as commitments roll off and as new opportunities come along. What I would tell you though is that the entire fleet is on that path moving up and to the right. What percentage of that, we will work through that through the balance of the year.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. High-level question for me on North America. In the last cycle, you had your SandKing systems that delivered tremendous efficiencies to the industry. And today, we're seeing a range of third-party last-mile and storage systems come into the industry of North America that delivers increased efficiency cycle-over-cycle for sand logistics. In the last cycle, the infrastructure broke down around 50 million tons, 60 million tons, it might have been north of that. You can clearly handle more. But I'd like to have your view on what the bottleneck that creep into the industry will be, and when they should hit, and when do you think that will become evident? What are the other black swans, in other words? Could you offer us that, Jeff?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","I think, Ole, the definition of a black swan is we don't see it, but the...","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, the grey swans then.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","The grey swans. Look, I think that the industry has demonstrated ability to overcome all of these. And that's one of the reasons that I'm very careful about how we invest in those things and what part of it that we own. I think that logistics will get tight, and it probably gets tight over the balance of the year. I like where we are in that place particularly because of our investment in logistics, and rail, and all that goes with that, so confident there. Then I think about getting the cost out, you referenced how we handle sand and move it around. I think the containerized solutions are going to be very good. I think they'll remove a lot of demurrage and allow us to move more sand more quickly. That's an example of technology having an impact. The other people and whatnot, I really do think is quite manageable, but with investment and the infrastructure that knows how to hire them, train them and put equipment to work.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You highlighted investment in a new coil tubing system, for example. Are there other product lines that because of changes in relative science or new ways of doing things could become problematic?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","No. I mean, I think, we're in the market all the time. So I tried to walk you through some of how we view technology and how we approached that, but I think we are very effective in the market at addressing those things that if we want to invest in them, and we think that they create value for us, we can. And we do those things that we feel like are going to be commoditized over time, or also the rents don't clearly accrue to us. I mean, that's another area where it may be better to partner with someone and not tie capital up where those rents don't accrue to us. And we've seen that over time.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, and I would totally agree with that. The bottleneck might be very short in life, so I was more thinking about industry bottlenecks as opposed to Halliburton-specific bottlenecks.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Yeah, and I mean, as I said, I think it'll be around people over time. Talking about North America, will be challenging to get staffed up. And I do think logistics, overtime, will get tight, I do think so.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just one follow-up on Iraq. You've put in your press release, a commentary that you're going back to work for Shell. Could you give us your view on activity in Iraq, in particular? The rig count has come down a lot, and those service companies talking about Iraq anymore. What's going on in terms of investments into the existing fields and infrastructure there?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Yeah, so I would say from a pay standpoint, it's kind of steady as she goes. What we like about it is our position in that market and the success that we've had with project management. And that's been a launch pad for us to kind of move that model more effectively into other parts of the Middle East and other parts of the world. So we like our position in that market. The Middle East, overall, has been generally resilient, but again, from our standpoint, important piece of business.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Good morning, Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, Jeff, could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of competitive dynamics between the basins in North America? So at this point, are things materially different for Halliburton in the Permian versus, say, the Bakken and Eagle Ford, or maybe there's less incremental activity so far but also for your competitors?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Well, we've stayed invested in all of the basins throughout all of the cycles, and so we feel like it's important that we're there, that we have the basin expertise to work in all those basins. So we're, and to a certain degree, basin agnostic in terms of how we are positioned. Now, clearly, the Permian Basin's got the most activity. I mean, you see all of those things. Look, I like the way we're positioned in each market.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, fair enough. Is it fair to say that you're back to working mostly all your fleets at 24\/7 operation to this point?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Yes, fleets are busy. We're starting to see even sort of the calendar firm up around customers with more than one rig and those sorts of things, which again, all inspire to help improve utilization.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just on international, you talked about better cash generation expectation the next couple of quarters. Assuming with international customers, where are you still seeing challenges, and where are you going to get traction in terms of collections?","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","I think generally seeing, with the exception of a few countries, we're seeing collections improving, not where they were at the end of the last cycle, but we see a path, we've got a great organization to connect with our customers and expect to see working capital continue to improve over the balance of the year. Thank you.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Yes. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jeff Miller for closing remarks.","Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.","Thank you, Candice. Look, I'd like to wrap up the call with a couple of key points. First, we're excited about the way North America's shaping up and believe that we'll outgrow the rig count in North America. Our reactivated equipment is going to work at leading-edge market pricing, while we wind up and repair pricing on our legacy portfolio. And these are marking the path towards normalized margins.","Now, while our more conservative international view is playing out, the international rig count has bottomed. And our strategy to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value is absolutely aligned with what's most important to our customers. I'm confident that our team can handle the challenges in these markets.","And so with that, thank you, and I look forward to talking with you next quarter.","Candice, please close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Abu Zeya","Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO.","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2018; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31st, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.","We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release and can be found in the Quarterly Results section of our website.","After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Abu. Good morning everyone. Commodity markets navigated some choppy waters during the second quarter. On the one hand, there are global oil demand concerns largely attributed to the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks.","On the other hand, oil prices have recently been buoyed by supply side reaction to the extension of OPEC plus production cuts, ongoing output declines in Venezuela, U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports, and political instability in Libya and Sudan.","Against this backdrop, Halliburton's execution in the second quarter was outstanding and I am very pleased with our results. We continue to build on the growth momentum internationally and successfully managed the market dynamics in North America.","Before we dive into the details, here are a few highlights for the second quarter. Total company revenue was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $550 million, representing increases of 3% and 29% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2019.","Our Completion and Production division grew revenue 4% and operating income 28% sequentially. Improved completion activity in North America land and our solid execution globally resulted in delivering better-than-expected margins.","Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew operating income 18% quarter-over-quarter with strong improvements coming from our Sperry Drilling and Wireline and Perforating product service lines. Overall, D&E division incremental margin was 44%.","North America demonstrated solid performance this quarter, delivering 2% revenue growth despite the dropping rig count. International revenue grew 6% sequentially, led by activity increases in the Eastern Hemisphere. And finally, we generated approximately $450 million in operating cash flow as well as positive free cash flow in the second quarter.","Now, I'd like to provide some regional commentary beginning with the international markets. I'm excited by what I see internationally, a continued broad-based recovery across multiple geographies, primarily driven by land and shallow water operations.","Our business in the North Sea is extremely busy both in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors. We have significantly increased our market share there by winning large tenders. Currently, we're sold out of drilling and wireline tools in the North Sea.","As activity keeps ramping up, especially with independent operators taking over IOC assets in the U.K., supply and demand balances significantly tightened for tools and I expect that incremental work will come with better pricing.","We see similar dynamics in the Asia-Pacific markets. Malaysia, Australia, and India are all showing strong activity growth. Increased activity leads to better pricing dynamics and we're already seeing the leading edge of pricing improvement in those markets.","For instance, tightness in the supply of open hole wireline tools has allowed us to raise prices in certain markets. As to the broader offshore market, we've seen enough signs to anticipate future growth. In June, the year-over-year change in offshore rig count was up for the 12th consecutive month and appears to be gaining momentum. However, the majority of large offshore projects being sanctioned or awarded today have a 2020 or 2021 start date.","For example this month we announced an integrated offshore drilling services contract win with Kuwait Oil Company. This is the first offshore project in Kuwait since the 1980s and it includes six high-pressure, high-temperature exploration wells on two jack-up rigs in the Arabian Gulf.","Starting next summer, Halliburton will provide well construction services, well testing, coring, coil tubing, and the majority of offshore logistical services under this three-year contract.","Halliburton entered this international recovery a much stronger competitor. Over the last decade, we've taken strategic actions that have increased the market opportunities in which we can compete.","To be specific, first, we made substantial investments to grow our international footprint in the years prior to the downturn. We increased our product service line presence in various geographies expanded our manufacturing capacity in Singapore, and opened technology centers in Saudi Arabia, India, and Brazil. I cannot emphasize enough how important physical footprint is in the international markets. You simply must be present to win.","Second, we made strategic investments and closed technology gaps in product lines that we believe are critical to our success in the international markets. These product lines are Sperry Drilling. I've talked to you a lot about iCruise our new rotary steerable platform. Rotary steerables are used globally for drilling both onshore and offshore wells.","A competitive drilling technology is critical because it's not only a higher-margin business, it's also the cornerstone of integrated well construction services. Because of superior technical specs and the modular design of this tool, we're confident that replacing our legacy platform with iCruise will enhance our competitiveness, save on maintenance costs, and improve asset velocity.","We're already running it in the U.S. as well as in Latin America, the North Sea, and the Middle East. In fact, it delivered the longest lateral and longest well in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale in its first deployment.","Another Sperry innovation introduced last year is the EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity sensor that turns on the high beams in the reservoir, so we can now see over 200 feet around the wellbore while drilling, more than double the depth of detection of other industry offerings. ","This technology is critically important for offshore exploration and has been instrumental to Halliburton securing deepwater drilling contracts in Norway, Brazil, and Guyana.","During the second quarter, a customer in Norway deployed EarthStar on a deepwater exploration well with a very tight drilling window, one of the most complex wells this operator ever planned. Using the data acquired by the tool, we were able to precisely land the well and to identify secondary pay zones directly impacting the well's production potential.","Other product lines we've strengthened are openhole wireline and production testing. These are highly technical and differentiated businesses. Today, Halliburton successfully competes for the most advanced openhole wireline and testing projects around the globe, going head-to-head with our key competitors.","All of these efforts give us a strong base to capitalize on the international recovery, and we expect to deliver high-single-digit international revenue growth this year.","As I highlighted, our Drilling and Evaluation division, driven in large part by our international footprint, performed as expected in the second quarter. The catalysts for the second half D&E margin improvement are all intact, and I have confidence in our team's ability to execute. We expect to see meaningful revenue ramps in Norway and India as mobilization costs wane and execution starts in earnest.","I've talked about the iCruise drilling system and the cost savings it provides to Halliburton. This and other D&E technologies that we're deploying will continue their market penetration and further improve our margin performance. Finally, end-of-year product and software sales should provide additional boost to D&E margins.","As I look ahead, I'm encouraged by the leading edge pricing discussions in various international markets. Although, we cut overall CapEx we have not done so at the expense of growing our international business. Our CapEx reduction is driving the right capital allocation decisions and the right pricing and return discussions.","Once the activity momentum builds internationally, it's hard to slow it down. Given the timing of contract starts and the current awards pipeline, I expect the activity growth to continue into 2020.","Now turning to North America. I am pleased with how Halliburton performed in North America during the quarter. Congratulations to our North America team for a solid execution.","In the second quarter we saw a modest improvement in hydraulic fracturing activity which manifested in mid single-digit increases in both completed stages and pumping hours during the quarter. While our pricing remained stable, we were able to improve margins by reducing costs and maximizing our equipment utilization. This is what I mean when I tell you that we will control what we can control and manage our business to perform well in any market conditions.","It's important to note that second quarter results were not solely based on performance of our hydraulic fracturing business. In fact, other C&P and D&E product service lines made meaningful contributions to both revenue and margins in North America in the second quarter.","The increasing contribution from non-hydraulic fracturing product lines is important. It demonstrates our strategy to profitably grow our share of services per well both in North America and internationally and the results are showing.","Despite the average quarterly rig count in North America dropping 13% since the first quarter, our cementing product line activity remained stable and margins grew quarter-over-quarter. We're able to achieve this with no additional capital by effectively utilizing assets and increasing the number of jobs per cement unit.","As well complexity and lateral lengths increase in U.S. unconventionals, creating dependable well barriers and curing mud losses has become more critical. Built on a century of technical innovation our lost circulation solutions and light cement slurry's delivered results in the most challenging conditions, differentiating Halliburton from the competition.","With tailored cement designs Halliburton executed the longest laterals to date in the DJ, Permian and Marcellus basins, with each lateral over three miles long.","Our wireline and perforating product line continued to generate profitable growth driven by its diverse and competitive technology portfolio and exceptional service quality.","In our North America perforating business, we're quickly gaining share with the proprietary integrated gun system. Halliburton velocity modular guns can be location preassembled and not require any field wiring, which makes them a lot easier faster and safer to deploy than conventional perforating guns.","With velocity guns, we're delivering more than 400 runs between misruns, a fourfold improvement in service quality and efficiency compared to conventional guns. Modular guns have seen a very fast uptake with our customers, growing to 40% of the gun shot by Halliburton in just a year from launch.","Our Artificial Lift business, which consists primarily of electric submersible pumps, continued to outpace the market. It delivered a record second quarter growing both revenue and profitability. ESPs have proven to be a very valuable asset in our production portfolio, serving both the conventional and unconventional markets.","Looking forward, I believe that our customers' activity cadence for the rest of the year will be dictated by their focus on remaining within their announced CapEx budgets and generating free cash flow.","Some will slowdown as they've been very efficient and will scale back completion programs for the rest of the year to stay within their CapEx guidance. Others may drop rigs, but will continue working down their docks. Majors will most likely continue executing their growth plans in the U.S. shale to meet their longer term objectives. ","As a result of these different customer behaviors, we expect that activity in North America will be slightly down in the third quarter. We anticipate the slowdown to be more pronounced than gassier basins due to persisting lower gas prices.","Despite the near-term softness in activity, we expect our margins to remain stable next quarter. We are taking the actions that allow us to protect margins and as evidenced by our second quarter C&P performance these actions are working. As we navigate 2019 and beyond our company is executing a different playbook than in the past.","Here's what we are doing to keep delivering returns and cash flows to our investors. First, we recognize the changing behavior of our customers and have changed our own approach to capital spending. In 2019, we decreased CapEx 20% year-on-year and the majority of the reduction came from North America. We have sufficient size and scale in this market and see no reason to invest in growth when it comes at the expense of returns.","The capital that we do spend this year in the U.S. is mostly directed towards increasing efficiency and refurbishing equipment, both with line of sight to improving returns and cash flow.","Second, we're reducing our operating costs. For example, we recently restructured our North America organization, removing several layers of management. The restructuring has changed our cost profile certainly, but it's also increased our market responsiveness.","We are also partnering with our premier supply chain and logistics organization to reduce our input costs. We continue to evaluate cost reduction opportunities across the company and we will manage and right-size our North America operations for the market environment.","Finally, we have stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue to do so where we do not see acceptable returns. The pressure pumping market remains oversupplied and we're not afraid to reduce our fleet size, as it contributes to righting the supply and demand imbalance. This may impact our top line in the near term, but saves labor and maintenance costs and I believe will lead to better margins.","We are taking these actions while continuing to drive growth in the product service lines that we expect to most positively contribute to profit and cash flow generation in North America. In my view, as unconventionals enter a maturation phase, represented by the pivot from scarcity to abundance, technology will differentiate Halliburton and I'm excited about our prospects.","Customers are required to maximize production for every CapEx dollar they spend and technology that can improve well productivity will be key to their success. These are the challenges that Halliburton solves every day. For example, our automated fracturing service optimizes sand placement per lateral foot and ensures every cluster makes a meaningful contribution to well production.","Our open-hole wireline business is growing in unconventionals, as customers spend time and money evaluating their reservoirs prior to fracturing them. We see increased use of fiber optics across various basins as operators aim to evaluate stimulation performance and make changes in realtime. And I am convinced that no one is better at collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per barrel than Halliburton.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lance for a financial update. Lance?","Lance Loeffler","Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin with an overview of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2019. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $550 million, representing increases of 3% and 29% respectively.","Now let me turn to our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.8 billion, representing an increase of $143 million or 4%. Operating income was $470 million, an increase of $102 million or 28%. These improvements were primarily driven by increased Cementing activity and completion tool sales internationally, higher artificial lift activity in North America, increased stimulation activity in North America and the Middle East\/Asia and increased pipeline services in Europe\/Africa\/CIS. These results were offset by reduced stimulation activity in Latin America.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of $50 million or 2%. Operating income was $145 million, an increase of $22 million or 18%. These improvements were primarily driven by increased wireline activity globally, improved drilling activity in North America, Latin America and Europe\/Africa\/CIS and higher project management activity in Middle East\/Asia. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced fluids activity in Latin America and North America and lower software revenue globally.","Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $3.3 billion, a 2% increase. Improvements were primarily driven by higher stimulation artificial lift and wireline activity in North America land and higher drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico. These results were partially offset by a lower software revenue across the region and reduced fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico.","Latin America revenue was $571 million, a 3% decrease sequentially, resulting primarily from lower software revenue and reduced fluids activity throughout the region, as well as reduced stimulation activity in Argentina. These reductions were partially offset by increased drilling and wireline in activity in Mexico and higher Cementing activity and completion tool sales in Argentina. Even though activity was slightly lower in Latin America this quarter, we expected to step up in the second half of the year, with a ramp up in Argentina, Guyana and Colombia.","Turning to Europe\/Africa\/CIS. Revenue was $823 million, a 10% increase sequentially, primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and increased well construction services in Russia, partially offset by reduced software revenue throughout the region.","In Middle East\/Asia revenue was $1.2 billion, a 7% increase sequentially, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales and increased pressure pumping, wireline and project management activity throughout the region, coupled with improved drilling activity in Asia. These results were partially offset by lower drilling activity in the Middle East.","In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million and we expect it to remain at these levels for the third quarter. During the second quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $247 million, consisting primarily of asset impairments and severance costs. As Jeff discussed earlier, we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment in North America.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $144 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same for the next reporting period. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 23%. Going forward, we anticipate our third quarter and 2019 full year effective tax rate to be 22% based on our expected earnings mix.","We generated approximately $450 million of cash from operations during this quarter. We made progress in collecting our receivables while our inventory slightly increased related to our strategic technology deployments. We expect inventory to be consumed through the rest of the year and I see second quarter as a step in the right direction as we generated positive free cash flow. We will continue to target working capital as a key focus for the organization. On a full year basis, we believe, working capital levels will be essentially flat with 2018. And for the full year, we still expect to generate free cash flow at or above 2018 levels.","Capital expenditures during the quarter were $408 million and our 2019 full year CapEx guidance remains unchanged. While our CapEx of $1.6 billion this year is similar to our DD&A level, we anticipate capital spend in 2020 to be significantly less than that. This level of spend will still allow us to capitalize on the international growth while being responsive to the market conditions in North America.","At Halliburton, CapEx is at the core of our strategy execution. Our capital allocation behavior drives the right returns discussions both internally and with our customers and this is consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors regardless of the market environment.","Finally, we continue our focus on delivering shareholder returns. During the second quarter we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the third quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect activity increases in the North Sea and Asia to be offset by lower activity in Africa and North America.","All-in, we expect sequential revenue to be up low single digits with margins increasing 125 to 175 basis points as we see the impact of the catalyst for D&E margin improvement that Jeff described earlier.","At our Completion and Production division, lower activity in North America will be offset by higher activity internationally and the impact of our cost reduction efforts. As a result, we believe that sequential revenue will be down low single digits with margins expected to remain essentially flat.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for the closing comments. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today, momentum is building internationally and activity improvement should continue into 2020. Leading edge pricing is trending upward as equipment supply and demand balance tightens in various geographies.","Halliburton has the footprint and the expanded technology portfolio to capitalize on this international growth. We recognize the changing behavior of our North American customers and are executing a new playbook to keep generating returns and free cash flow.","Halliburton is taking the right actions to be successful in this market. We have cut overall CapEx in 2019 and plan to do so in 2020 as well. This is driving the right capital allocation decisions and pricing and returns discussions. We are reducing our operating costs. We have restructured our North American organization and are also partnering with our premier supply chain and logistics organization to reduce our input costs.","We have stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue to do so with a focus on returns. We are strategically growing our share of services per well by increasing the competitiveness of our non-hydraulic fracturing product service lines.","And finally, we're developing technologies that will improve well productivity, a requirement of a mature unconventional market. We remain focused on delivering consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry leading shareholder returns.","And now let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James, your line is open. Please check your mute button.","Jeff Miller","James, you there?","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good Morning, guys.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Angie.","Angie Sedita","So I thought I was interested in your comments. Let's start on the international side for a change and the momentum you're seeing going into even 2020. Maybe you can give us a little incremental color on the degree of momentum we could see next year. Could we see similar growth levels for revenue in the international markets as you did in 2018? And then on the pricing side, do you expect it to continue to be region-specific or could it become more widespread?","Jeff Miller","Yeah. Thanks, Angie. International doesn\u2019t move as fast as for example North America. So, when we see a trajectory, it tends to stay on that trajectory. And I'm encouraged by 2020 because of the number of FIDs and types of things that we're seeing today that really don't get started until 2020.","So the Kuwait, for example, doesn't really begin until the middle of next year though it was won now. And so, the FIDs that we're seeing now, give me confidence about the trajectory for 2020. You're early to call growth rates for next year. But yeah, I think you meant 2019 when I see a similar kind of growth trajectory 2019 that carried over into 2020. And yeah that seems reasonable to me.","Angie Sedita","Okay. Okay, helpful. And then on the North America land market, some -- first kudos for being proactive on stacking equipment in this market versus flighting for share. You commented that you're seeing pricing as stable, and one of your peers said they are seeing some pricing softness. So maybe you could talk a little bit about pricing and then the degree of drop off that we could see in Q3 and even into Q4 as far as activity?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, Angie let me start with pricing. I mean from our perspective it was stable for us through Q2. That doesn't mean there isn't occasionally something that we see in terms of pricing behavior by a competitor. But on balance, very stable. As we look at the balance of the year certainly from an activity standpoint, I've said it would be down slightly in Q3. Obviously, Q4 always comes with weather seasonality all of that, I suspect given budgets that we would see more step down as well around that.","But I think what's really important here is as you described it the way we're approaching the market, I mean our playbook is different. We're very sharp around taking costs out where we see it needs to come out. We've demonstrated that we do stack equipment, will stack equipment and are just dead focused on returns and margins. And so that's kind of the way we see the second half of the year.","Obviously customer spend through Q2, we don't know that yet. But when we do know that, I think that will also be instructive on the second half of the year. We talk to our customers, so we know what they're thinking, but the fact is we need to look at where those budgets come out in Q2.","And I guess just one follow-up on international pricing you'd ask that question Angie. We're seeing international pricing. It is getting traction. It's getting traction around tool shortages and demand in certainly the North Sea. We've seen it in a few other markets as well. And I think that's part of what we see from our standpoint anyway that the capital discipline that we're driving is driving the right conversations with customers, and quite frankly the right choices by us.","Angie Sedita","Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sean Meakim","Thanks. Hi, good morning.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Meakim","So Jeff, you mentioned that you're working from a different playbook, given this is a different cycle and I certainly agree with that approach. And it seems like your thinking is evolving in terms of how you're looking at CapEx next year. Could you maybe just walk us through a little bit of flex points? I know it's still a bit early in the year, but how you're thinking about some of the flex around putting that budget together. I think one of the most common questions investors are wrestling with now is, for Halliburton, with the largest legacy frac fleet, how electric frac may or may not factor into those thoughts into next year? Could you help, maybe frame that out for us a little bit?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, Sean. I mean, we're in the early planning around CapEx for 2020. Clearly, we're in the early planning stages. But I wouldn't have highlighted if it wasn't going to be meaningful. So, just to kind of discuss CapEx 2020, we believe firmly that we don't sacrifice growth and opportunities internationally, and we still have room to grow in North America if customer budgets support that, important, the kind of behavior and decisions that capital scarcity is driving, and we will then continue that into 2020.","With respect to electric fleets, this is -- this is something we also we know a lot about and we've been testing those and had a fleet in the field for some time now. So, this isn't new to us. But it's also -- we're going to be thoughtful about where and how we deploy capital. So, as we look at that particular space, that's -- the market is over-supplied.","And so, when we get to the end of every year, when we think about CapEx, some part of the fleet rolls off every year and we look at that. And at that point, we're presented with choices and this is around replacement. Do we replace that asset with a quiet fleet or a dual fuel fleet or in this case could be an electric fleet? So, I mean, I see that lift from our standpoint as an evolution, but we don't see customers willing to pay more for that today. So that's kind of how we frame electric right now.","Sean Meakim","I appreciate that. Thank you for that feedback. And then Lance, I mean, can we talk a little bit more about working capital? You mentioned the inventory build in the first half of the year and your expectation that that will convert to a source of cash in the back half. How would you characterize collections across the different operator types at this stage? Are we in a fairly normalized environment or there's still some challenges here? How would you frame out that impact as we look at the back half of 2019?","Lance Loeffler","Yes. Sean thanks for the question. So, look over the last two years, we've generated over $1 billion of free cash flow and I expect that that trend continues in 2019. Now we've got work to do in the second half of the year, but the path to that free cash flow generation first starts with sort of margin improvement in 2H, particularly with our D&E business, right? But it also includes making progress on collection. We saw DSO improvement from Q1 to Q2 and I suspect that that will continue throughout the course of the second half of the year.","In terms of inventory that you mentioned, it is true. We've invested a considerable amount in inventory in the first half of the year as we continue to deploy iCruise and our Sperry technology deployment as well as I expect us to burn that down in the second half of the year in addition to the normal traditional completion tool delivery that we expect in the back half of the year. So, I think both of those will be momentum adding to our free cash flow.","Now, I'd also point out too, our rate of spend in CapEx was heavier in the first half of the year which is not unusual. We reiterated our guidance around the $1.6 billion of spend in this year. So it will have a slower rate of spend in the second half as well.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Thank you for all the details.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","James West","Hey, good morning, guys.","Jeff Miller","Hi James.","James West","So you can hear me now, right?","Jeff Miller","Yes. We can hear you.","James West","Okay. Good. All right, good. Sorry about that. That was a phone issue today. So my first question Jeff, international here we're starting to see some acceleration. As you look out into 2020 likely to see volumes at or maybe even above kind of current growth levels, plus you're going to get some offshore, plus you got some pricing. Could we be in a scenario where we start to dip into the kind of double-digit type of growth internationally in 2020?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean James, I'm not ready to call 2020 at this point, but there's no reason not to believe that's possible. I think, the thing we're going to stay dead focused on though going into 2020 are going to be margins and we want profitable growth. And I think, we demonstrated with where we are we can grow and we've grown quite a bit internationally. But we're going to again keep a sharp eye on margins as that market unfolds.","James West","Okay. Good. Fair enough. And pricing obviously is a big part of that margin profile. What's the level -- when you're having these conversations, I know you're on the road a lot in the international markets, what's the level of push back on pricing, or is the market now understanding hey, we're tight. Equipment's tight and you need to generate adequate return?","Jeff Miller","Well it's a mixed bag. I mean I would say that our state customers look at that scenario and realize that service pricing isn't adequate and returns aren't adequate and need the work done well and we have a lot more success with those customers and that's a bigger group of customer. It gets to be a bigger group of customer all of the time. It also helps when we say or demonstrate that tools are sold out and we can do that by making choices and so that also helps. ","Our service quality that Halliburton has is a level quite frankly I've never seen it before. And so what we have to offer is a fantastic product and so we're very comfortable talking about pricing today.","James West","Got it. Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citi.","Scott Gruber","Yes, good morning. ","Jeff Miller","Good morning Scott.","Scott Gruber","So I wanted to come back to e-frac. I realize it's early days for the technology, but assuming that a strong demand pull does materialize for the technology, would you look at e-frac capacity at a rate that approximates your share in the market relative to the industry build-out?","Would you look to invest more slowly to enhance free cash flow even at the risk of seeing your share within e-frac that it's smaller than your current share? How do you think about balancing e-frac share with free cash flow and is that an important factor for you?","Jeff Miller","Look returns are first and foremost for us. And so we looked at all of this in terms of returns. From a share perspective, the pace that I'm describing actually is perfectly adequate if we're happy with the returns and the technology deployment to keep up with where we are in the market. That's just sort of a normal replacement schedule that we're already on. It's just how we make those choices around what we replace.","From our perspective it's going to have to be a more efficient lower capital endeavor or somehow make better returns than what's out there today or it doesn't proliferate. That's not saying we don't participate, but what I'm saying is I want to make certain that the Halliburton approach around really power and pumps, we love the pumps that we have together are making a return. And at least where we see it today it's not a -- it's more capital for the same or less returns so that's not really where we want to be.","Scott Gruber","Got you. And then just turning to D&E. Lance based on the guidance that you provided it does look like a more material ramp in revenue and margin that's required in 4Q to achieve the flattish year-on-year. Something like almost maybe over 100% incrementals. Not sure if that's possible.","I'm just trying to play around with some numbers and using mid-single-digit growth. But that rate it looks like the incrementals would have to be quite large. How are you thinking about 4Q shaping up from a revenue and incremental perspective if the elements are still there for flattish margins on the year-over-year basis?","Lance Loeffler","Look I think we'll see -- we'll continue to see continued momentum in terms of the activity that we're doing in places like the North Sea and India. We're also going to have in the fourth quarter we've got visibility this year just given the strength of the international recovery more than we've had in prior -- in the last several years around software sales that will also be a tailwind to that.","But I think to come back to it, look D&E produced 44% I believe incrementals just 1Q to 2Q. I think that clearly the international recovery helps that business and what we've been talking about.","But what we're trying to describe right in terms of the tale of two halves is a business that, while it was weighed down by certain things or from certain timing perspectives as we continue to deploy our new Sperry technology is that you're going to see a market difference in the two halves of the year. And I think that's the message that we're trying to communicate to The Street.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Appreciate the color.","Lance Loeffler","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is open.","Bill Herbert","Thanks good morning. Lance just sticking with D&E for a second here. So get the fact. I mean you've been consistently persuasive with regard to the difference between first half and second half in terms of what drives D&E margins.","But just trying to get -- is the -- to reiterate the question, is the conviction relatively high and we're going to be in the neighborhood of flat margins year-over-year for D&E second half which implies kind of 13% to 14% margins in Q4? Sorry to beat a dead horse here.","Lance Loeffler","Yes. Look I think Bill, I said on the prior call that we'd be sort of flattish or in the ballpark. I think look, there's a lot of stuff that we've got to go out and execute but the tailwinds behind what we have looking forward for D&E for the second half of the year paint a very different picture in terms of margin profile than they did in the first half.","Jeff Miller","That means, Bill the mobilizations we clearly see those and those are finishing, finishing now. Sperry technology implementation certainly helps. There are other D&E technologies that we're rolling out. They're equally helpful. I talked about some of them on the call velocity guns other things ramping.","And then the visibility around not just software but year-end product sales is better than it's been in the past. And so, I think we're confident around -- the catalysts are intact. We can't prescribe the cadence necessarily, but certainly second half ramps up.","Bill Herbert","No, right. Thank you. And again I get the conceptual build influx. I'm just trying to get to a specific number within reason, but I hear you. Second question for me kind of multifaceted, first, if you could rank the C&P margin improvement, contribution quarter-on-quarter.","And what I'm trying to get as is to what extent did product sales drive the margin improvement? And then also what percentage of your frac fleet is stacked now? Thank you. ","Jeff Miller","I'll sort of start with sort of your question around sort of the allocation on C&P margins. But I think look -- Completion Tools had a great, great quarter. But I think the majority of what we're doing in terms of making sure that we're managing costs in North America is reflected in some of the C&P performance as well. I mean, we're being decisive or moving quickly and we're seeing the results and I think that's what's important.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And with regard to the percentage of your fleet that's stacked?","Jeff Miller","Yeah. Bill, I mean, we're not going into competitive specifics. I think you're in the market so you have a sense of what that is. I think the point is that we are continuing to stack equipment when it doesn't make sense. And I think that will come with slightly lower revenues, but certainly higher margins.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thank you, sir.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey, good morning. So, I guess, I wanted to talk a little bit about the preassembled perf gun solution that you mentioned earlier on the call. Could you talk about the solution that you have and maybe compare it to some of the market leaders out there? And then maybe just kind of talk about how this impacts the integrated frac solution that you're trying to push out into the market?","Jeff Miller","Yeah. So this is very competitive tool. In fact, we're fortunate, because we've got a solid manufacturing business in Alvarado, Texas where we've been building and making charges for years. So as velocity guns go into the market highly effective. We have the ability to tailor those as required for different configurations, which is a benefit certainly to us. And it's also part of bringing down in my view the overall, I'd just say cost.","This is the effectiveness around integrated wireline in North America. So we can change actually the way that we work to get to a lower cost and better performance, which is different than just having two things sitting out there together.","It changes the -- not just the number of people, but who is doing what allows us -- the velocity guns allow us to change the certainly the technical content on-location reduces the number of misruns or misfires. And I'm really excited about the volume. I mean, we described it as 40% of the goal gun shot by Halliburton, which is a lot of guns. But we see actually the potential to continue to drive unit cost of those guns down as the volume continues to grow. So that -- it's one of the things that just gets more competitive over time.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. All right. That makes sense. Appreciate the color. And then coming back to Sperry a little bit, I mean, obviously you guys have been investing a lot in Sperry. Could you talk about when we think about Sperry and potentially leveraging and working closer with land rig companies and the opportunity to kind of have a better penetration to some of your kind of leading edge Sperry technology?","Jeff Miller","Look, those are all things we look at. I think the really the rotary steerables and motors are very different animals in the marketplace. What we're doing in rotary steerables is really exciting for many. I mean, this is a fantastic piece of kit, and it's very integrated into sort of data and real-time and not just real-time, but automation, so, really excited about that.","I've always been clear that we didn't want to be aligned with just one, for example, contractor. I believe that if you look at North America, it's an open architecture market, and there is a lot of choice that can be exercised by customers. So, we've always been really careful to make sure of what we put in the market is functional with lots of providers. And so that's sort of a one thing certainly around the rotary steerables.","In the motor, I talked last quarter about our Motors Center of Excellence. And I'm really excited about that, because it allows us now to customize solutions for our clients around motor performance. So there is a lot of variability in terms of the rock and performance of motors. And having that in-house allows us not only to do the customization, but also retain the learning and bake that into a very efficient sort of turnaround in 24-hour type business.","So that's something that how we align it with operator is interesting, but the way I think more about it is, how does it from a value proposition standpoint work best for us and I think we've got it there now.","Chase Mulvehill","All right. I appreciate the color. Very helpful. Thanks Jeff.","Jeff Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Kurt.","Lance Loeffler","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Hey. So I have first question. I appreciate the color in the context of you guys stacking equipment and being capital disciplined on as it relates to U.S. frac-related businesses. Wondering if you guys can give us some sense on what the attrition dynamics might be, whether that's industry or as you look at your own frac fleet? How are you thinking about stacking equipment versus let's just say retiring equipment?","Jeff Miller","Yeah. I think the -- we're always managing the fleet, I guess, is the way I would say that. And there's clearly always -- when we have a big fleet it gives us the ability to retire, replenish, repair, and in my view replace and so we take all of that together. Some equipment that stack is ready to go back.","Some equipment that comes out of the system is actually the equipment I was describing that is being retired where we have choice around how we replace that equipment and at what pace. So, I think the -- we're really careful with the fleet that way. There's no question that equipment is working harder and attrition is occurring in the marketplace. We don't see capital spend going up. We just don't see new equipment coming into the market and we know how hard it's working. So, all of that conspires to drive attrition.","As I've always said it's hard to see the pace of attrition until there's a call on the equipment. I suspect there will be at some point, but I do know that the physics of pumping fluid and sand through steel is having its effect on broadly the fleet in North America, all fleets in North America.","Kurt Hallead","Yeah. That's great color. Appreciate that, Jeff. And then maybe for Lance. You gave some really good additional color on the D&E margin dynamics for the rest of the year. I was wondering if you'd maybe give us some insights as well on Completion and Production. And typically when you see a revenue decline in a certain business segment the margins would decline along with it. You guys have given specific data points here that suggest that even though revenues are going to decline for C&P in the third quarter margins are going to kind of hold flat. Do you think they have that kind of internal business momentum where your cost structure is down, your efficiencies are at such a level that even if C&P were to decline again in the fourth quarter you can -- your margins could be stable?","Lance Loeffler","Yeah. I mean that's a good question, Kurt. Look I think, obviously, we've got one quarter out so I'll save any of the specificity for next quarter's call in the fourth quarter. But I mean that's the intent. That's what we're working towards right? I mean that's what we talk about in terms of continuing to manage cost in North America and controlling what we can control. But we'll give a better view when we get to the third quarter call on what fourth quarter looks like for C&P.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. That\u2019s great. Nice, really appreciate the color. Thank you.","Lance Loeffler","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.","David Anderson","Hey, Jeff I was just wondering if you could maybe just dig into a little bit on the evolution of this new playbook in North America. I know you have a new head of Western Hemisphere, Mark Richard in there who is I think been putting his view in there as well.","But as far as -- as long as I can remember HAL always sought market share during the downturn now you're stacking equipment. It sounds like EBITDA per fleet may be improving as well. I guess -- is that almost early confirmation of the playbook? But probably if you can just give us a little background as to how you arrived at this new playbook?","Jeff Miller","Yeah. Just to cut to the chase, yes. The answer is yes. What you're seeing is that new playbook in action. But the -- what we recognize is there's a change in the customer spending patterns. And when that changes it has to -- we want to address the best returns. And so what was the right playbook several years ago when there was a different cadence and pace of customers spend today needs to change and so that's what you're seeing in action. And so we're going to be super sharp around capital into the downturn. I say the downturn but what we see is slowing activity that I described for Q3.","What we want to make sure is that we are -- if it's slightly down we want to be slightly there with our CapEx. But most importantly -- not our CapEx our capital equipment. But what's most important to us is that we're not waiting on the spring back. We've demonstrated we know how to add people back to the system and equipment back when it's required, so I'm quite comfortable that reflects down when the prices go below something that is making a return for us and we'll let somebody else do that at below return cost. So I hope that's clear. But that's the way we're thinking about \u2013 that\u2019s not how we're thinking about it that's how we're executing on the new playbook.","David Anderson","So in this new playbook, do you view each of your product lines and service lines separately? In other words each one of them have to basically hit certain return hurdles? How are you viewing -- because in the past we've talked about bundled models and integrated model and whatnot, but this sounds like we'll get more defining each one of our product lines has to stand on its own. Is that fair to say?","Jeff Miller","Yeah, that's fair. Though I would say we like integrated work and we do a lot of that in the North Sea, we do a lot of that around the world and we're happy doing that when it's available in North America. But at the same time, yes, everything has to make a return. And part of the reorganization in North America was around cost, but equally so was around speed of decision-making and executing each of those service lines. And I'm really pleased to report with the North America spend down in the first half of the year, our non-frac revenue per rig was up 13% year-on-year. So, that's evidence of that sharp focus around all of those service lines.","David Anderson","So, one of those service lines you called out is Artificial Lift and you talked about that being a driver of the higher NAM revenue. I was just wondering if you could just talk about that market in general in lift and how that compares -- how other lines product lines are trending. How is the spend and the pace of lift installations? How has that trended this year?","We all know about the ESP capital that's -- what it's doing to drilling completions. But what's going on with lift? Is that still kind of holding up pretty well? Do you expect it to hold up well? Could you just provide a little color on how the market is trending.","Jeff Miller","Yes. Dave I mean I feel like that's OpEx spend by clients and it's really important that they produce and support production and that means every well needs to work. And that's part of the reason we've talked about growing our production business. And I say growing and building out production because OpEx and production matters a lot to our customers. And I think that's what you're seeing in the ESP business because it's an effective way for clients to prove production. But chemicals in some ways falls along the same lines so excited about those businesses.","David Anderson","Okay. Thanks Jeff.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thank you, Shannon. Before we close, I'd just like to reemphasize a couple of points. First, I'm excited about the international recovery, the growth for the balance of 2019, and the momentum that's building into 2020. In North America, we plan to execute our new playbook reducing costs, stacking fleets, and reducing CapEx that drives better margins and free cash flows for 2019 and 2020.","Our focus on non-frac service lines is a terrific opportunity for Halliburton and our organization is well-positioned to deliver profitable growth. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter and Shannon, please close out the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day."],"11087":["Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) Q2 2013 Results Earnings Call July 22, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Kelly Youngblood - Senior Director, IR","Dave Lesar - Chairman, President and CEO","Mark McCollum - Executive Vice President and CFO","Tim Probert - President, Strategy and Corporate Development","Jeff Miller - Executive Vice President and COO","Analysts","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Angie Sedita - UBS","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","James West - Barclays Capital","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Doug Becker - Bank of America","Dave Anderson - JP Morgan","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","Scott Gruber - Bernstein","Robin Shoemaker - Citi","Operator","Good day ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator instructions)","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2013 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is also available on the Halliburton website.","Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Jeff Miller, COO; and Mark McCollum, CFO. Tim Probert, president of strategy and corporate development will also be available today for follow-up calls.","I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 and recent current reports on Form 8-K.","We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Overall I am pleased with our second quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.3 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton and operating income was over $1 billion. We achieved record revenues this quarter in our Baroid, Cementing, Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, and Testing product lines. From an operating income perspective, Baroid, Testing and Artificial also set new records.","Turning to the geographies, our international operations grew 8% sequentially which is at the top of our peer group. This growth came from record revenues in both of our eastern hemisphere regions. Compared to our two primary competitors, we have delivered leading year over year international revenue growth over the last five quarters. Also notable for the quarter, our international revenue comprised almost half of our total company revenue, which clearly demonstrates the success on our ongoing strategy to grow our international business and balance our geographic mix. So clearly, we are not just North America pressure pumping company.","Our Eastern Hemisphere played out as we expected. Revenue was up 11% sequentially and operating income was up 23%. I want to specifically highlight our Middle East\/Asia region, which had an outstanding revenue growth of 20% and operating income growth of 43% relative to the second quarter of last year.","This is a very exciting market for Halliburton today and we expect our Middle Asia region to be the highest growth want that we have led by Saudi Arabia, Iraq and all of Asia.","For the year, we still fully expect Eastern Hemisphere margins to average in the upper teens, with year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens. With pricing improvement opportunities in the Eastern Hemisphere continuing to be somewhat illusive, our current operating bias is toward improving our utilization and efficiency as we address the increase spend from our customers.","Jeff will discuss the weaker than expected Latin America performance and the Mexico integrated project market in greater detail. But I want to be clear on one thing, we feel confident that revenue and margins of Latin America will improve in the second half of the year. We expect margins to improve in the third quarter and approach the mid-teens level and expect full year margins to be approximately the same.","In summary, our international outlook has not changed. We expect consistently solid year-over-year growth in several key markets. Although, there is still uncertainty around Egypt, Libya and North Mexico activity in the near-term, our deepwater share gains coupled with increase rig count in Saudi Arabia and an anticipated rebound in Latin America during the second half provide us confidence that we will continue to outperform on the relative basis to our peers.","North America also delivered results as we expected and I\u2019m pleased with the quarter. Revenue was up 3% despite a sluggish U.S. land rig count and 71% lower Canadian rig count. We also saw 120 basis points sequential improvement in our margins to 17.5%.","We are now expecting the rig count to remain relatively flat for the remainder of the year as we absorb a meaningful switch to multi-well pad activity among our customer base. We believe this incremental drilling efficiency gains will provide for higher service intensity.","We currently estimate that pad drilling represents as much as 50% of the activity across key U.S. basins and we\u2019ll continue to pick higher. As an example, we\u2019ve seen the Eagle Ford growth of less than 40% pad activity last year to over 60% today.","Ultimately, we believe this efficiency trend bodes very well for us in the long run as our scale and expertise allows us to lead the industry in executing factory-type operations. And despite issues around capacity, utilization and pricing for the balance of the year, we do expect North American margins to continue to improve.","We believe we have reasonable visibility around North America activities for the third quarter. At this time it\u2019s too early to tell the full extent of customer plan revisions and their impact on activity in the fourth quarter. However, we believe that current commodity prices make budget reloading of more compelling option for our customers, which could help mitigate the risk to our fourth quarter slowdown.","I\u2019m optimistic about Halliburton\u2019s relative performance for the remainder of the year and our ability to grow our North America margins and continue to realize revenue and margin expansion in our international business.","Our strategy is intact and working well, and we intend to stay the course. We will continue to drive toward expanding our global portfolio in deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals.","We have been and will continue to be focused on delivering best-in-class returns. We bought back billion dollars of shares in the second quarter and today announced an additional repurchase of our authorization to total of $5 billion. These actions reflect our growing confidence in the strength of our business outlook and our ability to not only increase our buybacks but our dividends while leaving room for any capital spending or additional acquisitions we may want to do.","Now let met turn the call over to Jeff and he\u2019ll provide some additional operating detail.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our second quarter results. The Eastern Hemisphere had solid sequential improvement compared to the first quarter of 2013 with revenue growth of 11% and operating income growth of 23%. The improvement was led by seasonal recoveries in Norway and Russia along with the improved activity levels in Angola and across all of Asia.","In the Middle East Asia region, compared to the first quarter, revenue and operating income increased 12% and 17% respectively. The growth was driven by higher stimulation, wireline and fluids activity in Malaysia, increased drilling and stimulation activity in China and improved profitability in Iraq.","The Middle East Asia is a high growth region for us and Malaysia is a great example where revenue grew 40% year-over-year and profit more than doubled driven by our strategic offshore wins. We continued to build on this success in the second quarter displacing a major competitor to provide offshore cementing services and in addition winning a series of fluids contracts in Malaysia with an aggregate estimated value in excess of $500 million over the next four years.","Additionally, continuing our growth in Saudi Arabia, in the second quarter, we were rewarded a three year lump sum turnkey project to provide reentry services in an existing field. This strategic win comes in addition to the recently expanded reward for our multi-rig turnkey project in the kingdom.","Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, relative to the first quarter, revenue and operating income increased 9% and 33% respectively. The improvement was driven by higher fluids and cementing activity in Russia, increased stimulation, fluids and completion tools activity in Norway and higher drilling and completions activity in Angola. A highlight of note in the region, during the second quarter, our Baroid product line partnered with Cobalt International Energy to transfer our supersaturated (inaudible) viscosity fluid technology from the Gulf of Mexico to Deep Water Angola. This as well as the D&E were (inaudible) deepwater drilling and we believe this technology will be instrumental to the future success of Angola\u2019s new subsalt drilling project.","Within Europe, Africa and CIS region, we also have been successful in executing several strategically integrated projects. Let me give you a few examples now. In Russia we saw early success with our Em-Yoga integrated tight oil project. The project began earlier this year and by applying unconventional, multistage completion techniques to [this mature field], production has already materially exceeded targets leading to substantially increased activities in those fields.","In Norway, we recently completed first phase of an integrated multi-well project. Based on our success in delivering services and accelerating the production cycle, our contract has been renewed to 2015 and was expanded to include two additional fields.","And finally, in the Danish sector of the North Sea, we were recently awarded a five year multi product line contract with an estimated value of over $100 million to provide services on a high pressure, high temperature development. This reward was based on our proven track record of delivering integrated services in the Scandinavian market and a recognized expertise with HPHT services. All three of these projects are good examples of how we collaborate internally and with our customers to drive value into a project both with the operator and for Halliburton.","Overall, our Eastern Hemisphere performance has been impressive. If we look back to this year last -- this time last year; we\u2019ve grown revenue by 16% and operating income by 22%. In Latin America, we had a disappointing start to the year. Revenues were flat compared to the first quarter and operating income was down 7% as a result of reduced drilling activity in North Mexico, increased mobilization costs in both Brazil and Mexico and lower vessel activity offshore Mexico.","Moving into the second half of the year, we\u2019re confident that we will see an uptick in Latin American financial results. Let me touch on the few of the key drivers now. In Columbia, we see second half levels improving as our customers resolve some of the recent permitting delays. In Brazil, during the third quarter, we will complete mobilization of our directional drilling contract and expect the transition to our new market share in the fourth quarter.","And finally, in Mexico, we expect to see the largest improvement. In the third quarter, we\u2019re confident we will secure contract approvals related to our consulting and software services and see increased utilization of our stimulation vessels. We also expect to have finished mobilization of equipment for our recent offshore intervention services contract.","We anticipate the North Mexico activity will continue to be an issue for the region in 2013. However, I'm pleased to announce that we were recently awarded the Humapa block by Pemex in the [lease round] and incentivized projects.","Scheduled to begin in early 2014, this estimated $1.2 million project is for multiyear asset management contract in Chicontepec Basin. This most recent round of incentivized contract differs from the previous round and then it provides 100% cost recovery for our services during the first phase of the project. We expect returns for this project to be generated from our own service revenues and to be accretive to our overall business.","We were very selective in targeting the Humapa block. In fact, it was the only one we\u2019re dealing with. Because we believe that this project would generate robust returns at a lowest level of risk and better experience in the nearby Remolino Laboratory gives us a technical advantage in delivering timely productive wells.","We\u2019re also currently evaluating a pipeline of large integrated projects in Mexico valued at an estimated $8 billion. We expect this work will be awarded towards the end of the year. With the combination of these integrated projects and the Humapa project, we\u2019re excited about 2014 and beyond for Mexico.","Let me give you a few other Latin American highlights for the quarter. In Brazil, we inaugurated our Technology Center in Rio de Janeiro for Halliburton personnel to collaborate with operators and the country's leading university and a global center of expertise for both deepwater and mature fields.","Further, in the ultra-deepwater pre-salt market at Brazil, Halliburton successfully performed the deepest wireline fluid sampling and Rotary Sidewall Coring job ever undertaken. Samples were retrieved from depths of over 22,000 feet helping our customer identify the most productive zones of this exploration well.","We also see opportunity in the offshore Mexico market. We recently displaced the major competitor to provide open-hole logging services on a deepwater well. Based on a reservoir characterization portfolio including our geo mineralogical tool and our RDT formation tester with fluid indemnification.","Now, moving to North America, revenue was sequentially up 3% and operating income was up 10% driven by increased U.S land activity partially offset by reduced seasonal activity in Canada. Consistent with the first quarter, approximately 85% of our crews on the long-term contracts and about three quarters of working 24 hour operations.","In spite of relatively flat sequentially U.S. rig count, drilling efficiencies in the trend towards multiwell pads are driving more robust well count. Additionally, in some cases, we\u2019re seeing operators increasing the number of stages on horizontal wells performing as many as 40 stages per lateral in the Marcellus in certain [zones].","It\u2019s our view that the result in increased well count and stage count could absorb the remaining 4 percentage of the excess horsepower and help drive service intensity across all product line. Although we believe excess pressure pumping capacity has diminished since the first quarter due to rising demand, there is still an over supply in the market. As a result, we anticipate the pricing pressure will persist to some degree across many North American basins in 2013.","Additionally, as we gauge the utilization of our equipment on a 24x7 basis, we see a significant opportunity to improve and drive the light space, by that I mean the downtime out of the schedule. In this environment, we believe it\u2019s more important than ever to be aligned with most efficient customers where we can create the most value for our customers and deliver the best returns for Halliburton.","We\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy around surface efficiencies, subsurface technology and testing chemistry, delivering differentiated services that generate superior returns over the long term. As part of this larger strategy, Frac of the Future and Battle Red are really the platforms that enable surface sufficiency. We expect to see increased performance at the well head, as we incorporate these tools into our processes.","Battle Red effectively applies new processes and technologies to standardize and automate integrated workflows across our product line driving improved efficiency across our North American Service Delivery Organization. Although there are some associated cost savings, this initiative is primarily directed in improving working capital and cash flow.","We\u2019re targeting a 50% reduction in days to bill our customers and we expect these tools to also be able to help manage inventory level, reduce overtime and optimize low freight deliveries. As an example, we\u2019ve already seen a 15% to 20% reduction in costs around trade and standby charges. We anticipate Battle Red roll out will be completed in the first quarter of 2014.","Next is our Frac of the Future program, which is designed to reduce capital and operational costs at the well side. All these data indicates Q10 are running two to three times longer than existing power burden cost and five to six times longer than the industry standard before requiring maintenance, which we anticipate will reduce our fleet maintenance experience 5% to 30% . This efficiency also allows us to reduce the equipments needed on location by an average of 25% decreasing the capital required to deliver Frac fleet and reducing labor and fuel costs. Specific labor to process automation and reduce vehicle counts on the job site. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve indeed reduced our crew charges by close to 30% and believe our crews on location are currently streamlined. When we look at what we\u2019re able to deliver on a stage per head count basis, we\u2019ve seen a 40% rise in executional efficiency over the same time period.","By the end of this year, we anticipate that close to 20% of our fleet will be converted to Frac of the Future. The rate at which we deploy going forward will be dependent on three factors; North American natural gas activity, the growth of international oil conventional and our requirements would replace older equipment. We believe our manufacturing capability has a strategic advantage allowing us to manage deployment and quickly take advantage of changing market conditions. Assuming a consistent build schedule of new equipment, we expect to reach the 50% mark on Frac of the Future deployment around 2015. We believe these strategic initiatives will deliver material differentiation and provide a sustainable competitive advantage to Halliburton for the years to come.","Turning to the Gulf of Mexico, revenue was impacted by BOP certification related issues that has delayed several of our large completions to the back part of the year. For the remainder of the year, we expect revenue and profit will average higher than the first half, as deepwater arrive and more rigs move to development and completions. We\u2019re optimistic about the Gulf of Mexico deepwater market and are excited about our competitive position in the lower treasury market that we expect maybe double in 2014. We continuously work for ways to better manage our cost structure in the organization. As we migrate towards more efficient, differentiated service platforms, such as Battle Red and Frac of the Future, it will have an impact on support and operational headcount as well as equipment and inventory requirements.","We expect to complete an evaluation of these areas and you take action on them in the third quarter, which will result in severance and other charges during the quarter. We\u2019ll be identifying these separately in our third quarter results. So to summarize North America, we\u2019re forecasting rig count to remain stable for the year, but believe that activity levels can improve as a result of drilling efficiencies and further adopting of flat well drilling.","In a flat pricing and rig count environment, cost management is going to be more can and be extremely important, so we anticipate better cost optimization will result from our strategic initiatives. We\u2019re maintaining close contact with our customers to better understand their budget plans for the reminder of the year. We want to be clear that we expect North American margins to increase the balance of the year.","And finally, we\u2019re committed to growing our international revenues and margins and achieving a better geographic balance in our business going forward. I think our performance this quarter speaks for the progress we\u2019re making on that front. And now, Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Our corporate and other expense came in at $108 this quarter, slightly lower than expected due to some insurance reimbursements for legal costs, associated with Macondo litigation as well as decrease in costs related to our corporate initiatives. Approximately $34 million of our corporate costs were for continued investments in Battle Red and other strategic initiatives.","The cost of these initiatives will be declining over the next few quarters. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share after tax in the third quarter. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will average between a $110 million and $120 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.","We continue to benefit from the strategic realignment of our international operations completed last year and the continued expansion of our international business. Our effective tax rate this quarter came in at 29% in line with the low end of previous expectations.","We anticipate though that we might see a slight increase to about 29.5% for the third quarter. Our capital expenditure guidance of approximately $3 billion for the full year remains unchanged.","Throughout this quarter, we have continued to pursue in our (inaudible) settlement to resolve a substantial portion of the private claims pending in the Macondo multi-district litigation. However, discussions among the parties to the proposed settlement have recently slowed while BP challenges certain provisions of their previous settlement with the plaintiffs' Steering Committee including a current appeal in the Fifth Circuit Court.","We continue to believe that a reasonably valued settlement is in the best interest of our shareholders. But given the complexity of the current situation among other parties, it is difficult to estimate when or if a resolution through settlement can be reached. In the meantime, we\u2019ll continue to argue our defense against any liability in the course.","No adjustments to the Macondo Reserve was recorded during the second quarter as the MDL trial and other investigations progressed, we\u2019re constantly monitoring and evaluating developments. And it\u2019s possible that we may need to adjust our reserve estimate up or down in the future.","At this time, our reserve estimate does not include potential recoveries from our insurers. However, we did a reach favorable agreement with a portion of our insurers during the quarter which among other things, allows us to continue to be reimbursed for our legal cost.","As we communicated in our first quarter call, we intended to be more aggressive in our second quarter common stock repurchase activity. During the second quarter, we upsized our revolving credit facility from $2 billion to $3 billion and used the excess liquidity that transaction created to repurchase $23 million shares of common stock.","Last week, our Board of Directors approved increase in the authorization for future share repurchases to $5 billion. We are currently evaluating the best available repurchase methods.","This increased authorization together with the 39% increase in dividends announced in the first quarter is a reflection of our growing confidence in the Street from our business outlook and our continuing commitment to shareholder distributions. Going forward, we believe that company will generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to grow our business, increase shareholder returns and maintain flexibility to take advantage of any strategic opportunities we see.","Now, moving on to our near-term outlook. For our international business, we expect stronger revenues and margins during the second half of the year, but weighted more heavily to the fourth quarter. For the eastern hemisphere, we\u2019re currently expecting third quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the second quarter with a modest sequential improvement in margins.","Latin American growth is expected to be muted by the activity curtailment in Mexico but we should see a moderate sequential improvement of revenue with margins approaching the mid teens. And for North America, we anticipate a flat U.S. rig count for the third quarter. However, we expect to see the seasonal rebound from breakup in Canada along with stronger activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico. And we anticipate the net result will be modestly higher sequential revenues and margins.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments. Dave?","Dave Lesar","Okay. I know a lot of people were dialing in late, so let me give you a quick summary of what we said today. The North America based on improving activity levels in Canada and the Gulf and continued efficiency gains for U.S. land, we expect margins to continue to improve for the balance of the year.","As Mark said, in Latin America, we feel confident that revenue and margins can improve in the second half with margins approaching the mid-teens in the third quarter. For the Eastern Hemisphere, our outlook remains unchanged. For the full year we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens with margins in the upper teens. And our aggressive buybacks in the second quarter and the increase to our repurchase authorization clearly demonstrate our growing confidence we have in the strength of our entire business outlook.","And finally, we have been and will continue to be relentlessly focused on delivering best-in-class returns. So with that let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thank you. Good morning. Dave, I\u2019m curious and this sort of weaves into Jeff\u2019s narrative with regard to the Frac of the Future and of that Battle Red but the C&P margins in this quarter was actually a pleasant surprise for me. And I\u2019m just curious in a relatively labored D&E capital spending environment, sure with well counts and stage counts increasing, but overall absolutely, relatively flat range of our commodity prices as it were and free cash flow generation is still relatively challenged.","How high can C&P margins in North America actually go?","Dave Lesar","I think, Bill, we have always said that we see no reason that in a reasonably robust gas market that we should not be able to achieve normalized margins. And for us normalized margins would be in the mid-20s. And so obviously we\u2019re going to need help in gas from the gas market. But with the liquids market, I think underpinning sort of how low margins can go and you add to that the efficiencies that we see going on with respect to what we\u2019re going to get out of Battle Red and Frac of the Future. I can see a path there. And as I said, we\u2019re going to have to get a little help from gas. And obviously as we go forward into the balance of the year, so we\u2019ll get some help from Canada.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. And with regard to your prophecy for, I believe, full-year margins for Eastern Hemisphere in the high teens, the only part of that equation which looks still somewhat ambitious to me relative to first half margins is Europe, Africa and CIS which given what we did in the first half and plus a relatively vigorous rate of improvement in the second half of the year and what exactly is the road map for margin improvement in Europe, Africa and CIS as the balance of the year unfolds?","Dave Lesar ","Bill, I\u2019ll let Jeff handle that one.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay, thank you.","Jeff Miller","Part of that that path is kind of the pick up across Europe, we saw improving activity kind of through Scandinavia. We talked about project wins there, so that\u2019s certainly to the positive. We also see kind of the Sub-Saharan activity picking up around the free salt. We see a path to improving margins in the back half. But certainly the North Sea improving is a positive and then also our activity in Russia should improve as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Good morning, guys. The $32 million mark in the quarter was the improvement in supply chain and all, the continued improvements in Battle Red. I think Battle Red was supposed to go loud this quarter and you\u2019re talking about being implemented in Q1. You guys have spent a lot of money doing this and so we assume that\u2019s an investment. And so how long do you think it will take to recruit the investments you made and when does that quarterly investment start to approach zero?","Jeff Miller","Well, the Battle Red project, there are various elements of it that are rolling out each quarter as we go. So we talked about that. We expect the whole project to be completed by the first quarter of 2014. But there are some fairly critical elements that have already rolled out, like timekeeping and things of that nature, there are elements that will begin to rollout even this quarter, this next quarter and third quarter that will have an impact. We\u2019ve attracted, we look at the cost very carefully most of -- as just most of battle that is really around working capital and cash. But there is some fairly large savings in terms of headcount as well.","We\u2019re going to give more data for all of you when we have our Analyst Day in November along all these projects since just more specific information about the savings that we see. We are just suffice to say, we are pretty excited about what we see right now, believe very much in these projects and what way we\u2019ll deliver and I think you will be pleasantly surprised when we give that data as well.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","I love being pleasantly surprise, it\u2019s is one of my favorite things.","Dave Lesar","Very good.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","The follow-up question, in the U.S. the concern still exist that we all know that rig count isn\u2019t a very good denominator anymore and even that said, we don\u2019t have a lot of confidence in wells and footage because it\u2019s not reported very well. How much is rig efficiency running? How much is service intensity running, with a flat rig count in the second half of the year? How much can you really grow revenues? Is that a 5% number? Is that a 10% number?","Mark McCollum","Yeah. I think we\u2019re still kind of at a leading edge, Jim, with respect to the amount we\u2019ve had drilling in fact anecdotally when we talk to operators, they would describe what\u2019s been done until now as drilling holed and arguably better exploration, even some really big operators have said that they were waiting to really go for a long development.","So we\u2019ve seen upper single-digit type improvement in terms of efficiency even in the current year that\u2019s on the back of double-digit efficiency gain last year. So, yeah, I expect there is still headroom to grow around that scenario.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Thanks. Good morning.","Dave Lesar","Good morning Angie.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Really very good to see the continuation of the above peer group growth rates, international revenues and operating income. What drove you essentially modestly increasing your Eastern Hemisphere margin guidance from essentially the mid-teens but now the high-teens where specific regions or countries that appeared to be a bit better than you originally expected?","Dave Lesar","Yeah. Thanks Angie. A lot of that still on the back of what we\u2019ve seen in Asia, I mean, we really come on strong in Asia. We\u2019ve seen the kind of growth throughout the region and have no reason to believe that fairly database. Key contract, I mean, last year we\u2019re seeing those get started and grow into their -- grow into the types of margins we were expecting out of those and then we follow those up with few more rents.","Angie Sedita - UBS","So predominantly coming from Asia, fair?","Dave Lesar","Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. Certainly, we\u2019re leading in Asia.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Okay. And then as a follow up, revenue-related follow up on U.S. pressure pumping. I believe you\u2019re essentially the only company that\u2019s there 100% utilization. In prior conversations you indicated that you believe is that the rest of the market could become balanced by early 2014 and absorb this 20% overhang. Do you still believe that timeline or is that beginning to be a bit pushed out?","Mark McCollum","I think that timeline is beginning to push out just a little bit, that\u2019s on the back of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the overhang that\u2019s still there, though the thesis we stay with in terms of sort of the longer things go, cannibalization starts to occur of equipment in the market. So I still believe there is the ability to consume the overhang readably overtime, but don\u2019t see that as necessarily a Q1 \u201914 event.","Dave Lesar","I think when we initially made that forecast our expectations about rig count growth for the year, Angie, were a bit higher and as you get, as you heard, we\u2019re moderating that a bit and sort of assuming that we\u2019re going over flat rig count. Efficiency levels run higher, rig count lower, I think the combination of both sort of says it probably have a little bit more of, a little longer overhang in this pressure pumping market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Your margins and revenues in the D&E side for North America were actually lower. Is that all primarily Canada or is there some pricing (inaudible) lot and then what\u2019s the outlook for the remainder of the year in D&E?","Dave Lesar","Lot of that is Canada, that\u2019s a good D&E market for us and obviously with the rig count and breakup slowdown, we feel that more or so have we seen some pricing pressure there. There has been some pricing pressure in those other service lines. But again the efficiency of the drilling activity [taken that out]. It\u2019s the again primarily Canada.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","So margin should go back to the 18% kind of level in the second quarter in North America D&E?","Dave Lesar","May be a little bit softer than that but that\u2019s directionally the right way.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Now in the Bakken, there was some disruption in activity in the second quarter and completion activity was delayed because of the rains. Did you experience that or -- because that\u2019s a pretty large market for you guys or not?","Dave Lesar","Yes, we did. I mean we had a bit of an impact from that. The weather never helps us through the spring in that market and even in Canada there was the follow-up to breakup with the flooding that happened in Calgary. So it was [better this spring] throughout that area. We certainly don\u2019t expect that to repeat in the second half.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James West of Barclays.","James West - Barclays Capital","Jeff, last quarter you had alluded to in North American stimulation that you guys were going to seek some pricing increases, as we negotiate long-term contracts. Now it seems like you're kind of pushing out when the industry here comes back into the balance. But curious if that still is your intention and as we get into your rollover season here what the feedback has been from your customer base?","Dave Lesar","So let me clarify in terms of the discussions we're having with clients, better wells are still very important. And so that plays to our strength in terms of designing, custom chemistry for the best production, the sub-surface insight that allows us to design the best producing wells. So those continue. But as we said we continue to see some pricing pressure certainly variable across different basins. So I guess the pricing pressure doesn't go away as long as there is the overhang out there of excess equipment. But I think our technical ability to sell into those contracts is still very good.","James West - Barclays Capital","And then maybe just a follow up on international pricing from me. Dave, you mentioned in your comments that it was still -- the gains were still elusive but it seems like there\u2019s the bad behaviors out in the market now but your competitors are at least getting somewhat more constructive and I am curious on why you think given the delayed approach that you're seeing and that your companies are seeing that why that pricing pressure -- pricing power is still elusive?","Dave Lesar","Well, I think, James, a couple of reasons. One is that the price in some of these tenders in the international markets is still so large in terms of revenue stream and duration that everyone tends to sharpen their pencil when they tender and price these things. And number two, the ones that were tendered and launched several years ago all had upsell and new technology strategies in them all of which take a while to work their way through. So as I've said, at this point in time, I think our focus is on increasing margins through better utilization, more efficiency, we've not seen a pricing inflection point even with increased spending because customers are really pretty much taking us slow and steady in terms of their increase and typically slow and steady doesn\u2019t lend itself to a major pricing inflection point because all of a sudden a lot of capacity is stripped out in the market. So as I said, the international market is playing out almost exactly as we saw it and we believe we\u2019ve got a pretty good handle on what's going to happen over the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to clarify, get some clarification on one thing, I think, Dave you mentioned that there is going to be the Eastern Hemisphere going to be driven by Saudi and Asia? And then, I think, there was a question earlier about the margin improvement and I thought I heard that was being driven mainly by Norway, since now in Africa.","I guess my question is, can you give us some update on what you are expecting in terms of potential market improvement contribution from the Middle East to that Eastern Hemisphere dynamic is that primarily coming out of improving profitability out of Iraq or is it coming from improved activity in Saudi?","Dave Lesar","I think, Kurt, Jeff was responding to a question specifically on why the, our Europe, Africa, Russia operation was improving its margins and I think discussion on Norway, Continental Europe, North Sea was reflective of that. If you sort of pull all the way back in terms of the Eastern Hemisphere, even though we are proud of our operation in Europe, Africa, CIS, the action really is in the Middle East and Asia right now.","And so our Middle East operations will continue to expand. We are really happy with what we have going in Saudi, our operations in Iraq have stabilized. And then as Jeff has mentioned, almost all the way across Asia, we are seeing great success.","So, we are really happy with our Eastern Hemisphere portfolio right now. We haven\u2019t mentioned some of the African countries but they continue to do better. So, overall, I think that across the Board we are happy with where we are in Eastern Hemisphere just a summer driving forward a little bit faster.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then thanks, Dave, let me follow up to that, with respect to Iraq, you have a general timeframe as the when you think Iraq may become neutral or net neutral to your Middle East\/Asia margins?","Dave Lesar","It\u2019s neutral now. In fact it was breakeven last quarter, slightly profitable, it\u2019s more profitable this quarter. We are little positive on the outlook for Iraq, take it will be little slower and more measured as we go forward, but certainly more profitable.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Dave Lesar","Hi. Brad.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Could you guys just speak a little bit more specifically to what\u2019s happening in Egypt?","Dave Lesar","Yeah.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","From your business perspective.","Dave Lesar","Yeah. The -- obviously it\u2019s not going and hitting on all cylinders at this point in time. The customers have dialed back a little bit. One of the big issues we have is because of the concerns the government have, the ability to move around in the desert has been somewhat hampered, especially the ability to move explosives around and obviously, explosives are key to our business in terms of completing the wells.","And so, that\u2019s just made the logistics of doing our operations there a little bit more difficult. But it hasn\u2019t been shutdown but it clearly has been ratcheted back and obviously when you ratchet back and the revenue and add a logistical cost, it really starts to impact your margins more than it impacts your revenue.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Right. But you, sorry, so you guys, you have kept all the crew and whatever expect crew is in country and\u2026","Dave Lesar","Yeah. We have actually very, very few expects in place like Egypt. But we have maintained our crew, that\u2019s correct.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Got you. Okay. I don\u2019t really to follow up, Mark, what was the shares outstanding at the end of 2Q?","Mark McCollum","That\u2019s a great question. We had 917 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The part -- when you try to do the averaging to the quarter, right, most of the billion dollar, share buyback happened in May and June, and so the averaging effect had a little bit different effect.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Becker - Bank of America","Thanks. Jeff, I think, you indicated 50% of the frac we will have the [Q2] promise by the end of 2015, which I think implies about 50% conversation of the fleet over 3.5 years give or take? Also just trying to gauge if it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the full fleet will be converted in a total six to seven years, kind of a similar environment to what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of year. And if everything fell into place, how quickly could you have Q10 pumps in the entire fleet?","Dave Lesar ","Yeah Doug, that\u2019s the right pace. We expect to be by \u201815 at about half. But what I would say is castings that we\u2019re doing this sort of ratably as the market allows and as equipment as they\u2019re taken outside the U.S., equipment retirements occur. But we have continued to retire equipment in order to get the equipment into the field. So that\u2019s the right pace, kind of in the five to six year pace, but that would to a certain degree be limited by market. And we wouldn\u2019t get over our skies if the market didn\u2019t allow it.","Doug Becker - Bank of America","How quickly could you -- if 550 gas, international commissions are ramping up, how quickly could you in the perfect scenario\u2026?","Dave Lesar ","Very quickly. I mean that\u2019s, my reference to our manufacturing capability allows us really to turn more quickly than probably anyone in the marketplace around bringing equipment forward. So we would love to have the opportunity to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Anderson of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Dave Anderson - JP Morgan ","Hey Dave, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about 50% of drilling in the U.S. is on pad drilling. I was a little surprised by the number. It seems a little higher than I was thinking. Was that a number for Halliburton and if so, can you just tell me where do you think that number goes say by the end of 2014?","Dave Lesar","Now the number Dave, that\u2019s our view of where the market is today, not just for Halliburton. And I think that as we try to allude over the last couple of quarters, I think the people that are analyzing our industry have got to move away from rig count. They\u2019ve got to move away from well count and really look at sort of horizontal footage drilled and given the position that we have in the U.S. and given what we see out there, we think that basically the pad drilling is 50% or so. The other thing that you see is pad sizes are getting much larger and that just drives more efficiency and more service intensity.","Dave Anderson - JP Morgan ","And I was just wondering if you can help me quantify this impact. Let's just say you take five wells on pad drilling which is five wells kind of standalone. How would you think that your margins should be different between those two wells or is it going to reduce cost or whatever the best way to measure that impact is?","Dave Lesar","The margins are better on the back -- the number of turns we get on the equipment. So if we\u2019re rigged up on a single location, we have even particular equipment that allows us to move from well to well without having to move the equipment at all. So if we think in terms of start to finish or time between wells, we are just working more on a pad and the larger the pad, the more we work as opposed to rigging down and moving away to somewhere else.","Dave Anderson - JP Morgan ","So is that like a 20% to 30% increase in margins, something on those lines?","Dave Lesar","Well, I think, obviously we know what that amount is, but we\u2019re not going to tell the world.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","Hi, good morning.","Dave Lesar","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","The discussion around Q3 North American outlook top line growth being driven Canada and Gulf of Mexico coming back, but you had implied that the U.S. land business kind of trajectory into the course of Q2 is pretty flattish. Is that correct? And I guess, one of my questions.","Dave Lesar","For Q2 we saw improvement in North America land, again, offset by those other items. So I wouldn\u2019t infer that.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","I guess so was that improvement April through June that was better than the March [through May]? I guess it was around\u2026","Dave Lesar","Yes, on a state count basis, we\u2019re seeing an improvement. So we\u2019re back kind of consistent with what we saw middle of late last -- middle of sort of third quarter of last year. So I mean we are seeing the activity rebound.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","Then another question I had is just around Latin America. So in this, we see the revenue improvement in the second half of the year, if that was to kind of bounds around what's reasonable, is it fair to think kind of low side case of revenue growth of 5%...","Dave Lesar","I think they are 5%.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","\u2026 in case of 10% full year in Latin America year-over-year?","Dave Lesar","I think they are 5% numbers per year.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Scott Gruber - Bernstein","Good morning.","Dave Lesar","Good morning.","Mark McCollum","Good morning.","Scott Gruber - Bernstein","Given the more temporary outlook here for rebalancing of the pumping market, I assume you are not considering extending the size of your U.S. pumping fleet during the first half of '14? I assume that's correct because you didn't increase your CapEx for the second half of the year?","Dave Lesar","That would be correct. Our expectation is to kind of stay where we are.","Scott Gruber - Bernstein","Okay. So how do you think over the medium term about that choice between continuing to improve margins which is clearly the goal today and the opportunity to take share in the U.S. market, personally I think that the U.S. market should be a good market over the medium term as the industry moves to monetize cheap natural gas. Are you thinking about a certain margin level that you want to get to before you start adding capacity in your -- above your cost of capital today? Are we getting back to this normalized margin or we should think about before you start increasing your CapEx?","Dave Lesar","Well, we\u2019ll start with returns first. So everything which is in this business is around returns and so as long as we are happy with our returns and we are getting equipments to work, we wouldn't take share at the expense of returns. I really don't know that, I mean, with -- on the back of the things that we are dealing with Battle Red and Frac of the Future, I don't see those few things as mutually explosive. Some of the systemic things we are doing allow us to grow share even with the equipment we have or with the same level of equipment that we have.","Mark McCollum","Yeah. I think there are two things to consider, Scott, one is that with pad drilling in the efficiencies that our equipment is working today. As we look at it, you are creating effective utilizable space on a calendar, as we work faster and more efficiently.","The second thing, which is I think, unique to Halliburton, remember we are retiring equipment as we roll out our Frac of the Future. But that equipment was working today, still viable equipment and right now because we don\u2019t see the need for excess equipment, we\u2019re parking it possibly destining that equipment for our international operations along the way.","But, if the right opportunity presents itself along the way, we have the ability to redeploy some of that equipment back into the U.S. market or not pull it out of service in order to capture share, while we see that we have an opportunity to continue to give very good returns and work for the right customers and the right basins with the right technologies.","Kelly Youngblood","[Sam], we\u2019ll take one more question?","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Robin Shoemaker of Citi. Your line is now open.","Robin Shoemaker - Citi","Thank you. I want to ask about Mexico, go back to Mexico for a minute, the contract that you won in Chicontepec, I believe, you talked about cost recovery. And then I think there is a fee-per-barrel arrangement after that. So, can you describe exactly how that works and why there was --- why you believe there wasn't a much broader interest among the oil service companies in these Chicontepec blocks?","Dave Lesar","Yeah. The cost per barrel or the fee-per-barrel is really the smaller piece of that type of project. Really, it\u2019s a situation where we provide services into the project and then earn cost of recovery to get paid at what we believe are certainly accretive margins to our business.","I think the interest by others, I can't say what others were necessarily interested in or not, but I would say that this is very difficult work. It takes a lot of reservoir inside in order to determine which field and how to produce over time and a full suite of services that it takes to do all of that work. So, we won that -- the Humapa that we won, we are really comfortable with where we are and really the last thing that prevents broad group to really enter that is quite frankly the capital over those processes required to embark on these types of things.","Robin Shoemaker - Citi","I see. Okay. So, on these increased projects that you described that are coming up in Mexico, are some of these projects that will involve, sort of, high-end technologies or are these going to be really very competitive types of tenders?","Dave Lesar","Well, it could be both. I think that a combination over describing our all of the integrated drilling, not like the incentivized rounds that we just finished talking about but drilling wells for [four p-max] and a lump sum type fashion and those range from some more simple to some that are actually quite complex. So I think we\u2019ll see competitive -- it will be competitive just given the size of the activity. But the type of technology required I do think will be important as those projects are with.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.","Kelly Youngblood","Okay, thanks everybody for your participation. We\u2019ll be doing follow up calls over the next couple of days. And Sam with that you can go ahead and close the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

Outstanding execution resulted in an excellent fourth quarter and we are in a strong position to take care of opportunities presented by a growing North America market and improving international conditions. 2017 was a dynamic year for the oil and gas sector that marked another step on the road to recovery for our industry. I am pleased with the way our Halliburton team executed our value proposition, maintained strong service quality, generated superior results and industry leading returns. I\u2019d like to thank the outstanding employees of Halliburton for their hard work and focus the entire year and for tremendous fourth quarter.","I am very excited about the way 2018 is shaping up. Commodity prices have moved up. North America unconventional activity should be very busy, international markets are starting to show signs of life and our value proposition is resonating with our customers. I will address each of these in a few minutes. But first, I want to recap the highlights for the full year and fourth quarter.","During the course of 2017, we grew our market share, generated industry-leading returns and outperformed our peers across every region. We accomplished this by aligning with customers in the fastest growing market segments and collaborating in engineering solutions to maximize their asset value.","Total Company revenue grew 30% and adjusted operating income tripled, finishing the year with total Company revenue of $20.6 billion and adjusted operating income of $2 billion. In North America, we told you, we would win the recovery and we did. We recognized the changing market before anyone else, moved more quickly to reactive equipment, maintained historically high market share, raised prices and captured key customers before others could, a pretty tough task to pull off and we did it.","Our international business began to show signs of recovery in the latter half of the year, driven primarily by improved performance in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America. And finally, we generated approximately $2.5 billion in operating cash flow and retired $1.4 billion in debt.","And now, a few highlights for the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total Company revenue of $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income of $764 million, representing a sequential increase of 9% and 21%, respectively.","Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter, achieving nearly 50% incrementals, reflecting improved drilling activity in multiple regions and year-end software sales. As I've said many times before, we are way more than a completions company.","Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 8% sequentially, once again outperforming the change in the average U.S. land rig count. And we increased our cash position by $440 million in the fourth quarter, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline and efficient working capital management.","This quarter demonstrates the strength and diversity of our portfolio. We have the leading position in hydraulic fracturing, which is clearly important. However, the results this quarter demonstrate the value of Halliburton's position as a multidisciplinary, integrated service provider with industry leading cementing, completion tools, drilling fluids, drill bits and software product lines, and much improved positions in artificial lift, directional drilling and wireline.","Geographic diversity is also a key component of our strategy and our international business proved resilient. Middle East activity was consistent throughout 2017 in areas like the North Sea and Brazil that come on strong in the second half of the year. Our geographic diversity provided stability through the cycle and rounded out this quarter's excellent results.","In the fourth quarter, our Completion and Production division margins were impacted by two expected transitory headwinds in North America, seasonality and cost inflation. As we expected, year-end presented some spotty activity caused by holiday schedules, weather and exhausted customer budgets. The frac calendar remained full due to the tightness in the overall market, but it came at a higher cost due to the increased idle time and mobilization required between jobs. I would rather serve our customers and capture revenue with temporarily lower margins than I would like as opposed to losing the revenue entirely. That is what our world-class business development organization allows us to do.","During the fourth quarter, we also saw cost inflation in sand and trucking. The price of sand escalated over the last few months of 2017, but I believe that increasing sand capacity, particularly from localized mines combined with our supply chain strategy will reduce the cost throughout 2018. Trucking is tight across North America and is particularly tight in areas like the Permian where activity is strong and locations are remote. We believe our increasing use of containerized sand will help mitigate trucking inflation by reducing the required trucks per well site and demurrage. Now, these headwinds were anticipated, are transitory, and are not a surprise at this point in the cycle.","Now, let's talk about 2018. To remove any doubt, I am confident that we will achieve our normalized margin goals and here is why. As I've said before, we have three levers to pull in order to achieve normalized margins and they\u2019re working. All three levers are important and the great thing about Halliburton\u2019s scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull them all in a meaningful way. Halliburton is the execution company. We are going to pull these levers to get to our normalized margins.","The first lever is pricing. North America completions market remains tight and we are sold out. Therefore, we continue to push pricing across our portfolio. Improving oil price and demand for equipment provides runway for us to continue to increase our pricing through the first half of the year. The second lever is utilization. Equipment utilization is very impactful for a Company of our size. We continue to place our equipment with those customers who know how to effectively and efficiently use us to increase their productivity, which improves our utilization. I can tell you that customers rapidly returned to work after the holidays and we expect improved utilization to drive margin growth.","Finally, the third lever is technology that reduces cost and increases efficiency and production. We use our continuous improvement initiatives to focus on designing technology that meets market demand and reduces costs for ourselves and our customers. A great example of this is Snapshot, our digital tracking and analytic system for our hydraulic fracturing equipment. With Snapshot, we can assess what every piece of equipment is doing every moment of the day. This big data application allows us to optimize operations to reduce downtime, minimize maintenance and compare the efficiency of completion designs. We\u2019re able to compare operations across basins and countries to get optimal results from our fleets. These levers, combined with superior service quality, allowed us to triple our margins in C&P since the fourth quarter of 2016. I believe the effort, economics and enthusiasm that I see today, puts Halliburton well along the path to 20% margins in 2018.","Now, let\u2019s talk about new builds for a minute. We have a set criterion, it is return driven, and we follow that criterion. That criterion was met in the fourth quarter and we delivered a handful of spreads to the market. This additional equipment along with our existing equipment maintained market share, improved our margins, and generated industry-leading returns. So, let\u2019s get some perspective.","We still have less equipment in the field than we did at our peak in 2014. You know I\u2019m committed to leading returns. We build our own equipment, we manufacture faster, cheaper and with less lead time. Most importantly, this allows me to make discrete decisions, and I\u2019ll do it through the prism of achieving leading returns. You trusted me to do this in the fourth quarter, you got leading industry returns. My plan is to do this going forward.","Bottom-line is, I\u2019m excited about 2018. The supply and demand dynamic is correcting and commodity prices are improving, supporting activity around the globe. Our strategy resonates with our customers. This helped us navigate the downturn and more importantly, positioned us to win a recovery domestically and abroad. I believe that the U.S. land market will be very busy in 2018 and that demand for horsepower will continue to grow. Rigs continue to get more efficient, but more importantly, completions intensity continues to grow with longer laterals and tighter spacing. As a result, I believe that the rig count to frac spread ratio has narrowed such that today, this ratio is nearly 2 to 1. Think about that for a minute. It's gone from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1 in four years.","Tightening rig to spread metrics, ignore the impact of increased wear and tear on equipment, there is no doubt that today's industry horsepower is working harder than ever before and that the pace of degradation is increasing on active equipment. The impact of wear and tear on the working fleet is demonstrated by the industry's rise and average horsepower per crew. Today, the industry is forced to employ redundancy measures to mitigate non-productive time on the well site. We know this is happening because we see, customers pushing our competitors to bring spreads of 45,000 to 50,000 horsepower to a job while Halliburton remains at 36,000. As a result of drilling efficiency, completions intensity and equipment degradation, I am confident the market will remain tight in 2018.","We're using local sand with a few customers in the Permian and I believe this will become an increasing trend as additional capacity is activated. Therefore, sand cost should go down in 2018 as regional sand mines come on line and capacity is increased. We have contracted with multiple suppliers to optimize our value proposition and maximize our logistics plan in areas where local sand makes sense. This will not happen overnight, but we are working with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we can provide desired profit at a reasonable cost.","As for the international markets, I am encouraged for the first time in three years. Green shoots are appearing in the form of more tender activity and constructive conversations with customers. It's great to hear the change of tone in our discussions with our customers and to be able to work collaboratively with them to create solutions that overcome the challenging economics. While we expect activity to gradually improve throughout the year, an overcapitalized market, pricing pressure and concessions that have been given throughout the cycle, need to be unwind. As a result, I believe the market will improve this year, but the recovery will be choppy.","Our strategy is working and winning. A recent example is our contract award with Aker BP in North Sea. This win demonstrates the power of our value proposition and the strength of the people in this organization. We listened to what the customer wanted and collaborated together to create a business model that aligned incentives between the operator and its service providers. This five-year contract for well construction services will showcase our drilling and digital technology. Under the agreement, we execute integrated operations in the three-party collaboration with the operator and the rig contractor without owning a rig or taking on reservoir risk. We take on execution risk, but as the execution company, we welcome this risk and believe this agreement is a win-win for all parties.","Throughout the downturn and during the recovery, we invested in new technologies that provide value to our customers and growth opportunities in new markets. Our wireline business is a great example. We broadened our capabilities and developed industry-leading services for formation, evaluation and well intervention. We saw positive results from this investment last year with solid market share gains including some key wins in the Middle East and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in this product service line and we plan to continue to invest and expand this business.","In wireline, we are listening to our customers and responding with technology and solutions to meet their needs and expand our business. We\u2019re doing the same thing with our recently acquired Summit ESP business.","Overall, our effective, clear and sustainable strategy combined with market momentum and our dedicated employees give me confidence that Halliburton is best positioned for the year ahead. We are the execution company. We will provide superior, technology and service quality for our customers, and this will result in industry leading returns and positive cash flow for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update.","Chris Weber","Thanks, Jeff. Let\u2019s start with the summary of our fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third quarter. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $764 million, representing a sequential increase of 9% and 21%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased global drilling activity and end of year software and product sales.","Moving to our division results. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 12%, operating income increased 62% and operating margins improved by 420 basis points. These increases were primarily due to year-end software sales, which were stronger than expected and increased drilling activity in the Middle East, Brazil and North America.","In our Completion and Production division, fourth quarter revenue increased by 8%, operating income increased by 5% and operating margin was generally flat. Revenues were up primarily due to improved pressure pumping activity and pricing in U.S. land, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Latin America, and increased stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. The operating margin was impacted by the seasonality and cost inflation headwinds that just Jeff described.","In North America, revenue increased by 7%, primarily driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector in the majority of our product service lines, primarily pressure pumping as well as higher drilling activity and completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue increased by 16%, primarily driven by increased drilling activity and software sales in Brazil, as well as higher software sales in Mexico and increased stimulation activity in Argentina; these results were partially offset by reduced drilling activity in Venezuela.","Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue grow by 7%, primarily due to improved drilling activity in the North Sea coupled with increased activity in Algeria and Egypt. These results were partially offset by a reduction in completion tool sales in Nigeria. In the Middle East\/Asia region, revenue increased by 12%. These results were primarily driven by increased drilling and stimulation activity in the Middle East and year-end sales in China.","Regarding Venezuela, we continue to experience delays in collecting payments on receivables from our primary customer. These delayed payments combined with recent credit rating downgrades and deteriorating market conditions required us to record an aggregate charge of $385 million under GAAP. This charge represents a fair market value adjustment on our existing promissory note, and a full reserve against our other accounts receivables with this customer. In addition, we will no longer accrete the value of our promissory note beginning in 2018. We actively manage our strategic relationship with this customer and we will continue to vigorously pursue collections as we do business going forward.","In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $79 million, which was slightly higher than anticipated as a result of an environmental charge. For the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate that our corporate expenses will be approximately $70 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $115 million, in line with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect our net interest expense to be approximately $140 million as we will no longer accrete the value of our promissory note in Venezuela.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter excluding tax reform and Venezuela-related charges came in at approximately 27%. In December, the President signed a comprehensive tax reform bill. That among other things lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and moved the country towards a territorial tax system. For Halliburton, this tax reform bill is a big positive. We expect it to lower our effective tax rate percentage from the high-20s to the 21% to 23% range, reflecting the new U.S. corporate rate plus state and local taxes along with our geographic earnings mix. The lower effective tax rate will positively impact our future earnings and help level the playing field with our foreign domicile competitors.","During the fourth quarter, we recorded an $882 million non-cash charge, primarily as a result of a preliminary provision for the net impact of tax reform. As I mentioned, this is a non-cash charge. Given our current U.S. tax attributes, we do not expect to pay any cash tax on our deemed repatriation tax obligations. We expect our 2018 full year and first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 23% based on our expected geographic earnings mix.","Turning to cash flow. We generated approximately $440 million of cash in the quarter, improving our cash position at year-end to $2.4 billion. The increase in cash was primarily due to strong cash flows from operations, which included working capital improvements, and continued disciplined capital spending. Our 2017 CapEx came in at approximately $1.4 billion, slightly below our depreciation and amortization expense of $1.5 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately in line with our depreciation and amortization expense in 2018. This CapEx guidance includes deployment of new Sperry Drilling tools and the continued investment in our artificial lift and production chemical product lines and industry-leading pressure pumping fleet.","Given the current operating strength of our business and the favorable outlook just described earlier, we are actively evaluating our options around usage of cash, which could include debt retirement, funding acquisitions and organic growth projects or return of capital to shareholders.","Now, turning to the first quarter. Our 10-year historical average for adjusted earnings per share from the fourth to the first quarter is a decline of 16%. Because of improving North America land operations, we believe it will be about half that in the first quarter.","Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments. ","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Chris. Let me sump it up. I\u2019m really happy with our 2017 results. They reflect our successful strategy and execution and put Halliburton in a great position. I\u2019m excited about what I see for Halliburton in 2018. The macro is self-correcting. Commodity prices have improved. Unconventional activity is strong. The international markets are recovering. We expect to generate significant cash flow. Our value proposition is resonating with customers. And all of this together will continue to result in industry-leading returns.","Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Jim Wicklund","Good morning, guys. Good quarter, that needs to be said. This quarter that as we said. My question instead of dealing with domestic really is about international. We all talked last year about how the rig count probably bottomed in the middle of the year but pricing was difficult. Jeff, you mentioned that it started to improve a little bit in the second half. Can you talk about how far concessions and pricing went down and what\u2019s going on with pricing internationally now?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, Jim. We\u2019re in every market around the world, so we have great visibility into that. And the short answer is there still a lot of pressure. When I describe green shoots, I\u2019m talking about activity. But that activity is spread thinly. A lot of capital available in the marketplace, and because activity is spread thinly, it doesn\u2019t create the kind of tightness for a price inflection. And then, the concessions given were significant and in some ways continuing into 2018, some of those haven\u2019t even been implemented. So, look, trust me, my tone is changed and I see price inflection, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s until later 2018 and certainly we will see it in 2019.","Jim Wicklund","And just continuing on that, I know you had talked last year about the hope and expectation that we would get to normalized margins in the U.S. market and you made that comment again that you expect to get there in 2018 for domestic. When do we hit normalized margins over the next couple of years in the international sector? I know that\u2019s a big crystal ball question, Jeff. But I mean, just in general, how many years do you think it will take before we reach the level that we\u2019re getting to in 2018?","Jeff Miller","I think it\u2019s not this year, it\u2019s not probably 2019. It takes -- that ramp is slower, Jim, because of contractual nature of the market and it\u2019s really driven off of, first and foremost, tightness in the U.S. But, what we are seeing is I think the kind of commodity price support that will build that confidence with our customers, which will then create the tightness, which then creates the path back. And so, and I guess, my last comment on that, I think our value proposition is perfectly suited to drive back towards those normalized international margins, because we are so focused on maximizing asset value. And I think quite frankly that paradigm will continue.","Jim Wicklund","Well, I'd rather see a staged recovery, first domestic and then international that last a couple of years than everything peaking at the same time. And that sure doesn't look like going to happen. Jeff, thank you very much. I appreciate it, guys.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Jim. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","James West","Hey, good morning guys and great quarter.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, James.","James West","So, I want to continue on international side, because clearly North America is going to be great this year and I'll let others talk in detail about that. But, on the international recovery that you are discussing, I know we talked about some seasonality of course in 1Q, but how should -- and I know you talked about uneven, but how should we think about one kind of the timing of those green shoots starting to show up in revenue? And then, I guess, two, which markets, which geographic markets are you say more excited about?","Jeff Miller","Yes, thanks. So, I think that that progression is ratable as how I would describe that. I think, we see growing confidence and added rigs sort of progressively through 2018, obviously with some inflection coming later in those stages, as I've said. But, I don't see it as a spike. It's a confidence building and we grow into that activity. But, what I\u2019m most excited about internationally would certainly be North Sea. I think that's a market that's going to have legs in 2018 and we'll see activity growing there. And we're certainly excited about how we're positioned there, clearly excited about I think Middle East broadly. Again, I think we'll continue to be resilient and will have some pockets of better activity.","James West","Okay. And then, I believe over the last kind of two or so upturns, you've built out the international infrastructure for Halliburton. You have most of -- you deployed most of the capital I think that you probably need to; you\u2019ve got the market share that supports that cost structure. Although, you always want more, I get that. But, it seems to me like, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you don\u2019t really need to deploy a lot of capital. This is more of a let's just soak in the revenue when it comes and get very good incremental margins or cash on cash returns as the cycle takes off internationally, is that fair?","Jeff Miller","Yes. That is fair, James. I mean, look, we're very excited about that franchise. And I've said that throughout even the downturn that investment that we made four years ago, five years ago and building out that footprint that is a valuable piece of franchise. And yes, capital is largely in place to execute on that. And that should be a very good business for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.","Angie Sedita","So, Jeff, turning back to the U.S. a little bit. When you think about the market in 2018, just industry wide, have you done any work or any thoughts on how much newbuild equipment to be coming into the market in 2018 from the industry? And how much newbuild equipment could come in where you think it would be a concern as far as tampering or dampening the outlook for pricing?","Jeff Miller","Well, Angie, I think, the activity in the market -- the market to start with is undersupplied. We\u2019re well aware of what\u2019s in the marketplace today and\/or that\u2019s going. And everything I see given the increasing intensity in completions, actually the drawing in of that ratio of rigs to spreads, which from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1, which really is an example of what that intensity looks like gives me a lot of confidence that it stays tight. And that metric I\u2019m talking about doesn\u2019t take into account wear and tear on equipment, which I think we\u2019ve demonstrated is quite real, certainly through the downturn as we look at equipment that never came back in the market and the way that it\u2019s working right now.","Angie Sedita","And then, in 2017, it really was a big focus on your legacy equipment and where we stand today, how much of that equipment is still beneath the market as far as the spot, and thoughts on timing there?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think from my perspective that has -- I said, originally that would take about four quarters and it\u2019s taken about four quarters for things to turn over. So, as we look ahead, we\u2019ve got a lot of ability to move -- because of the tightness, opportunities with pricing as we go into 2018. In fact, I\u2019m quite confident that we\u2019ll see all three of our levers executed that being price, utilization and technology.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jud Bailey","I wanted to ask for -- maybe we could get a little more color on how to think about margin progression for both C&P and D&E, both for the first quarter and just thinking about the rest of the year. I know, internationally, we\u2019ll have a pullback seasonally, but it also sounds like in the North America, you still expect to get the normalized margins. You had some seasonality, which impacted you in the fourth quarter. So just trying to think about progression for both of those businesses for the next few quarters. If you could put some color around that would be great.","Chris Weber","I mean, in line with our guidance, I mean, expect Q4 to be down. You\u2019ve got the typical benefit of year-end product sales in the fourth quarter and seasonal pullback in activity in the first quarter in certain international markets. But going forward, looking at C&P very much in line with what Jeff said, normalized margin target is still there and we\u2019re working towards it. And for us to be able to do that, C&P is going to have to be a big driver of that, and so, very much committed to achieving that sometime in 2018.","Jud Bailey","Okay. But I guess, it\u2019s fair to think that if you were to hit normalized margins, you\u2019d probably do it before, certainly before the fourth quarter, given the seasonality impact. So, you\u2019d hit it during the one of the high points of your typical -- your best two quarters or typically the second, third quarter. Is that a fair way to think about it though?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean, we certainly are confident we get there. And yes, it starts with customer urgency, which we see; it starts with -- the second component of that is to be sold out, which we are. So, those two give me a lot of confidence around our ability to move on price. And to deliver, when we deliver, to deliver the 20% normalized margins. Obviously, C&P division will be performing very, very well. D&E just to follow that up, D&E is solid business for us. And I talk about our franchise. We expect to see -- D&E has made consistent progress through the downturn, both in share and margin recovery. And so, I suspect that we continue with that also for the fullness of the year.","Jud Bailey","Got it. I appreciate that. And then, if I could ask -- just step back and ask you about international again. You've obviously -- you've highlighted last couple of quarters have been very strong. You're taking share as you noted. Could you maybe just give us a little more color on where do you like you've executed your international strategy the best, whether it would be product lines, regions? Maybe just give a little more comments, because your performance has been quite strong. And so, I would like to just get your thought on where you\u2019re most pleased and where you're executing and then how you see the market in 2018? Thanks.","Jeff Miller","Well, look, for us it all starts with our value proposition which is to collaborating engineered solutions and maximize asset value for our customers. But, if we think about that like a platform and then we add superior assets to that, then, our team is very effective at delivering integrated solutions where it\u2019s a project management type outcome, but also discrete solutions. And so, I'm very pleased with clearly what we've done in the Middle East and what we've done in Brazil and all around the world. But, it really comes back to service quality, is fantastic and when we deliver that. All of our solutions are well-aligned with our customers. And that again takes a geographic view as well as a service line view, because we're aligned with maximizing asset value for our customers. And I think that's a key paradigm and the feature that we believe in and that's what we do.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Bill Herbert","Good morning. Chris, I assume that when we're speaking of your targeted 20% normalized margin, that's for North American C&P. And I'm just curious as to what the spread is right now between North American C&P margins and overall C&P Margins. In other words, what overall C&P margin do we have to hit over the course of 2018 for you to hit your, quote unquote, targeted normalized margins?","Chris Weber","Normalized margins obviously focus on North America. C&P is the biggest driver of North America results. And so, those are going to need to be in line.","Bill Herbert","Okay. So, basically, effect -- you say in line, so we would expect to hit an overall C&P margin to 20%?","Chris Weber","Then they\u2019re going to need to be in line.","Bill Herbert","And what do you mean by that?","Chris Weber","In same ballpark. ","Jeff Miller","In think there are other components to that. I think we've described that as having -- it's got international activity and it has got various different things in it that comprise that. But, I think it's a good surrogate for what we see in North America.","Bill Herbert","Okay. That's great, Jeff. Thanks. And then, so, I -- different point is, we\u2019ve had -- I mean, you explained it very candidly and very clearly with regard to some of the constraints in the fourth quarter in terms of margin in relation to revenue uplift in Q4 for C&P. If you're going to hit kind of a high teens or even 20% margin in 2018 for C&P, even taking into account the seasonality in Q1, then, you guys must have a pretty strong line of sight in terms of pricing realization, net pricing improvement over the course of 2018 in order for you guys to hit that margin because typically, you guys are pretty comprehensive and complete with regard to formulating your guidance.","Jeff Miller","Yes. That\u2019s what we see. I think, again, I\u2019d describe it in terms of levers, so price is an important part of that, but as is some of the other things.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And Jeff, you talked about the fact that you are sold out for the first half. Does your frac calendar -- is it starting to substantially populate for the second half of the year?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean, Bill, when I say foreseeable future, it\u2019s kind of out as far as I can see. Now, it has limits in terms of where is that -- visibility perfect or not. But, yes, I\u2019m confident that we have, works in 2018 and that\u2019s why say, I am really excited about 20018.","Bill Herbert","And then, finally for me, we\u2019ve got a sort of historically tight domestic labor market and an especially tight labor market in the Midland basin and other energy markets, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas as a whole. And the difference between the unemployment rates today versus where we were that kind of trough unemployment rates in 2008, 2014 is that we have a lot of runway for the growth and what looks to be a sustained increase call on U.S. production. How are you dealing with these labor constraints, given this tight market and what is expected to be even tighter going forward?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Bill, I trust in the strength and sophistication of our HR organization. We\u2019re the biggest service company in North America and that means we operate the business. I think we operate it across the entirety of the U.S. though as you say some markets are tighter than others. But, we\u2019re able to recruit and even non-traditional -- clearly recruit in non-traditional oilfield markets as well. And these are really good jobs in the oilfield. And so, we mitigate the labor issues through the national recruiting effort. And it\u2019s important to remember that this is the same human resources machine that hired 21,000 people in 2014. So, I\u2019m confident that we find the people to do the work.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Scott Gruber","Jeff, just following on the normalized margining question for C&P. How do you think about normalized margins in the D&E segment? I realize it will take a longer to get there given the international exposure, but roughly where would you peg those at in the new environment, but after all your share gain?","Jeff Miller","Look, I see them in the same ballpark just over maybe a different timeframe. But certainly, I mean, those businesses are substantial; they\u2019ve got great value propositions, they have grown share, delivering terrific results as well. I think about for example, I could pick on individual technologies, but it is BaraShale Lite for example, a fantastic breakthrough and fluids technology that does two things. It actually improves efficiency and it\u2019s just a better solution. So, we\u2019ve got a number of those and those are the kind of things that as they get rolled out, move margins up, it takes share to start with though. ","Scott Gruber","And then, Jeff, you had positive commentary on pricing during your remarks, typically investors to take that and interpret it as positive pricing for frac. But, we're also hearing about positive traction across a lot of the minor product lines in the U.S. today. Can you put some color on the pricing trends you're seeing in cements, wireline, directional coil? You have underappreciated exposure I think to some of these product lines. So some color here would be great. And do you actually see greater pricing traction in these wirelines versus frac or is about on par today?","Jeff Miller","Look, I think, you see all of that to a degree moving together. We'd always said that, those didn't fall. Other service lines didn\u2019t fall as faster as far as frac. And so, the comeback would be less dramatic and pronounced than frac. But clearly, there is a flight to quality around those other service lines as well. And we do have pricing traction in those other service lines.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Anderson","Good morning, Jeff. So, E&P capital discipline has been one of the themes we've been hearing about quite a bit. I was wondering if you could give us your take on how you think E&P behavior is changing or could change with this cycle? Kind of hearing some of the E&Ps are talking about trimming some of their rig counts but they're selling to using some lower pricing. Can you give us your sense of what your conversations are like right now as we kind of start with 2018 and kind of how you think E&P behavior could change?","Jeff Miller","Yes, great question. And look, we listen to our customers. And because we listen and don't lecture, we understand the message that they get from their shareholders. And there are many different customers with many different strategies. Clearly, there is a group that's interested in generating more cash and being more disciplined. There is another group that has acreage that they absolutely want to prove up and their stakeholders want them to do that. And so, I think you can't think North America was a single brush certainly in that regard. But, what I can tell you is that those sets of customers are going to be working and busy in 2018, and I expect busier in 2018 than they were in 2017.","David Anderson","And then perhaps we can go back to on the capacity side, you made a few comparisons with 2014. And perhaps maybe one comparison I\u2019m very interested in is how you think about the useful life of your frac equipment in 2014 versus today. And then, within that context with the amount of capacity that\u2019s coming on in 2018, do you have a sense as to how much do you think needs to replaced for attrition? We've heard various numbers, I was curious your take as to what do you think that attrition number is?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I think I'll start with attrition. And I think attrition is a real dynamic, though it may take the form -- I used the degradation on the call this quarter, just because in many cases what happens it become too expensive to bring back. But, there is a quite a bit of cost associated I think for the industry in terms of keeping that equipment in the marketplace. So, that's a real number, but it's difficult to give you a number on that though it drove -- if you try to look at what was in the market before the downturn, what did make it back out for the downturn I think is indicative of sort of the pace of degradation or attrition that happens. But, the market today clearly is undersupplied in our view. And, I think you ask about increased intensity or more stage counts and longer later is going to drive more wear and tear on equipment, which is simply the number of reps.","When I compare it to 2014, I am more confident just because we've increased or we\u2019ve deepened the amount of Q10 technology we have in the market which consistently bears up better to that kind of stress, ergo the reason we\u2019re able to execute with less horsepower on location than what we see in the market.","Operator","And the next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Waqar Syed","First for Jeff, in the past, you\u2019ve given numbers on how the frac sand intensity per well has been changing, any updates on that?","Jeff Miller","No, Waqar. I mean, it\u2019s just kind of down the middle. I would describe -- that dynamic is really what I think optimization looks like. And so, we will keep an eye on that, but we haven\u2019t seen a lot of change in the last quarter.","Waqar Syed","And then, at our energy conference in early January, many of E&P remarked that they were seeing broad based service price inflations in the range of 5% to 15% in the U.S. Now, would you agree with that kind of range or do you think that that number still underestimates maybe what the price inflation could be in 2018?","Jeff Miller","I think that underestimates it. But, I\u2019m not going to call on where we see pricing. That\u2019s certainly competitive for us and I think it\u2019s also a function of where you are in the marketplace. Where you start, drives what that percentage is. But, nevertheless, tightness and urgency, which all of this begins with customer urgency, which clearly we see today is the support for that price.","Waqar Syed","And then, just one final question. You mentioned about stimulation business picking up outside of the U.S. as well. I can see it in Argentina and maybe Saudi. Are there any other market as well, where the stimulation business is increasing internationally?","Jeff Miller","Look, primary activity being as we\u2019ve always said Argentina from an unconventional perspective has the kind of rocks and the beginnings of infrastructure that make that, we\u2019re very excited about that. We\u2019ve got solid pumping businesses in a number of markets around the world that we\u2019re excited about. And I\u2019m always also excited about the ability to apply multi-staged frac to tight reservoirs and what have been sort of historically under-produced reservoirs. So, you see those in a few other countries around the world and also in some offshore markets where we create value.","Operator","And the next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Sean Meakim","In the prepared comments, I don\u2019t think I caught a CapEx budget for 2018. So, maybe you could just give us a sense on what your spend is going to look like this year and maybe what kind of flex there could be in North America depending on what the market gives you?","Chris Weber","Yes. So, we -- right now, we said in the call that 2018 CapEx would be in line with D&A. We think D&A is going to be around $1.6 billion in 2018. ","Sean Meakim","And then, just one more point of clarification. On the one key you guided, you talked about half of sequential drop you\u2019ve experienced historically just given the faster start in North America. Was that an earnings-before-taxes comment or was that EPS, just curious how tax reform impacts the sequential change there as well?","Chris Weber","Yes. That\u2019s EPS. And obviously, tax reform does impact, but don\u2019t forget, we have the -- we\u2019re losing that interest accretion on the promissory note in Venezuela. So that\u2019s why we guided to the higher net interest expense in the first quarter. Those could -- it's going to be a push.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Timna Tanners","I would follow up if I could on Chris's comments about being actively evaluating options to use cash. Just, I'm not expecting you to lay it all for us, but to the extent possible if you can give us any thoughts on timing, order of preference and where you'd like to see some of your debt metrics going forward. Thanks.","Chris Weber","Yes. So, we've discussed before, we\u2019ve got that $400 million maturity coming due in August this year and we intend to retire that. After that we\u2019re going to -- everything is really looked at through the returns lens. And we'll think about where we could deploy capital with regards to growing the business, where we can generate those leading returns. And if we don't have opportunity to present themselves there, we'll look at returning it to shareholders, both considering share buyback and dividends.","Jeff Miller","Timna, I'm glad to be talking about that again.","Timna Tanners","This is a good point. Do you have a sense of your timing, can you just talk about is there an urgency there, are you content to wait and look at opportunities, is the M&A market particularly attractive versus organic opportunities?","Chris Weber","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s urgent, it\u2019s something -- like Jeff said, we're excited to be having that be the dialogue, further dialogue internally and thinking about when and what the right timing is. And so, we think that's a great reflection of where we are from a cycle recovery perspective. And so, you\u2019d also ask just about kind of where we'd like to see debt metrics and we talked about this before. But mid-30s debt to cap, and we want that -- our debt-to-EBITDA to be under 2.5 times.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Quick question for Chris. When we think about free cash flow conversion over the next few years, if I kind of look at 2018, it looks like your free cash flow conversion versus kind of net income, based on your CapEx guidance is going to be about 80%. As we think about going forward, is that a fair number when we think about free cash flow conversion?","Chris Weber","Yes. What we said is that we expect to achieve a free cash flow conversion kind of in line or greater than peers. And so, that's what we're working towards. And that largely comes through capital discipline. Obviously if the market is ripping and we see lots of opportunities to put capital to work at great returns, we'll have to look at that. But, in a sustaining market environment, free cash flow conversion, in line or better than peers is what we're shooting for.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. ","Chris Weber","And we had great results in 2017 on that. We were about 120% free cash flow conversion in 2017.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay, great. And then thinking about where the pressure pumping horsepower demand is today in U.S. onshore, maybe if you want to take a stab -- at that, and just kind of how undersupplied do you think the market is today?","Jeff Miller","Look, I think it's undersupplied. Clearly, we've estimated 1.5 million horsepower probably somewhere like that. And what continues to keep it there is the degradation on equipment and the intensity growing around completions. And that's meaningful and that's longer laterals, that's more stages; in some cases more sand, in some cases less; but in either case, simply more activity driving the demand. And then to that point, the flight to quality that we see towards our assets, our platform and approach to work, I\u2019m very confident and excited about 2018.","Chase Mulvehill","And how much share have you been able to hold through the recovery? Have you been able to kind of maintain, kind of peak of share, have you given some of that back?","Jeff Miller","Look, we said all along, we reached sort of the highest share we\u2019ve ever had as we worked through the downturn. And our intent had been to settle at a higher than our historical share through the recovery, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Candice. Before we close up, I\u2019d like to just reinforce a couple of key points. First, I\u2019m excited about what I see for Halliburton in 2018. The commodity prices have improved and unconventional activity is strong. And finally, we expect to generate significant cash flows and industry-leading returns. So, I look forward talking to you next quarter. Candice, you can close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

[Operator instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Abu Zeya. Please go ahead.","Abu Zeya","Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO.","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.","We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

What a difference 90 days make in this market. Commodity prices have rebounded, customer budgets are refreshed and we're back to work. Our results for the first quarter played out as we expected and I'm pleased with how our organization executed both in North America and internationally.","Here are the first quarter highlights. Total company revenue of $5.7 billion was essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 and adjusted operating income was $426 million. International revenue increased 11% year-over-year, which was a great first step towards our expectation of high single-digit international growth for all of 2019.","Our Drilling and Evaluation division had a strong year-over-year revenue growth of 7% with activity improvements across all geographic regions. Finally, as expected, hydraulic fracturing activity ramped up in U.S land as customers refreshed their budgets. And despite pricing headwinds, our execution resulted in delivering better than expected margins in our Completion and Production division.","From a macro perspective, 2019 is off to a strong start. Commodity prices have been rising since the beginning of the year due to tightening oil supplies and stable demand. OPEC plus production cuts and supply disruptions from Venezuela, Iran and Libya have supported market rebalancing. Oil demand trends, particularly in China and India, have also been constructive. Overall, the macro environment remains favorable for our industry.","Against this backdrop and with winter behind us, customer activity in both hemispheres has picked up off December lows and continues to trend higher. Although we often discuss the hydraulic fracturing business in North America, it's important to remember that Halliburton has a portfolio of 14 product service lines operating in North America. For example, our artificial lift and cementing businesses showed excellent results in the first quarter, growing both revenue and margin year-over-year.","Our artificial lift product line grew top line revenues 55% year-over-year in the first quarter driven by strong demand for ESPs that are now installed much sooner in the life of the well and sometimes right after the wells put on production. Halliburton is the number one cementing provider in U.S. land. Demand for our cementing services continue to be strong in the first quarter. Congratulations to our artificial lift and cementing teams for an outstanding performance.","Now let's turn to our North America land hydraulic fracturing business. We experienced an increase in the stages pumped every month this quarter with March finishing on a high note. Overall, the first quarter activity level was modestly higher compared to the first quarter of 2018. As expected, we had pricing headwinds throughout the quarter. However, we believe the worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the success of our hydraulic fracturing business is not dependent on pricing alone.","Given our presence in all basins and exposure to all customer groups, we have the ability to pull other levers such as utilization, cost savings and operational efficiency to drive a better outcome for our business. Let me describe what I believe will happen with hydraulic fracturing supply and demand throughout 2019. On the demand side, it's evolving as we had anticipated. Our customers have announced their 2019 budgets and we expect that overall spend will be down 6% to 10% in North America.","Here is how I see the impact of our customers' 2019 budgets on the North America land stimulation services business. I expect that customers will operate within their budgets largely by achieving savings through sand cost deflation and by reducing drilling activity. On the other hand, I believe that net completions activity will remain essentially flat year-on-year as our customer seek to achieve their publicized production targets.","In the near-term, our view on North American customer activity heading into the second quarter is shaped by the momentum that we saw building at the end of March. As for the next couple of quarters, I see demand for our services progressing modestly. The cadence of spend across basins for various companies will look different throughout the year, but Halliburton has the scale, range of services and customer relationships that capture more than anyone else out of every dollar spent in North America land this year.","Now let's talk about the supply side. Given the demand landscape, the service industry is adjusted accordingly and cut capital spend. Currently, new horse power is not being added to the market. At the same time, the existing equipment is working a lot harder today, leading to equipment attrition. The key driver of this is service intensity, which quickly translates into shorter equipment lives and higher maintenance costs.","Let me give you some data points to put this in perspective. Halliburton is currently pushing 30% more sand volume through equipment than in 2016. The shift to local sand that is finer and more abrasive also leads to more equipment wear. Customers are drilling longer laterals and fracking more stages per well. Last year we fracked 20% more stages per horsepower than we did in 2016. And with increased efficiency, we've improved utilization, achieving more pumping hours per day. Again, more wear and tear.","Industry sources estimate that about 7.5 million hydraulic horsepower will need to be rebuilt in 2019 to maintain a flat horsepower supply. This equates to $1.7 billion in equipment spend that I do not see forthcoming as the service companies have cut capital spending plans. As a result of these factors, I believe the capacity attrition will occur naturally throughout the year and that there will be less horsepower available in the market at the end of the year than there is today.","Halliburton will significantly reduce North America hydraulic fracturing CapEx this year. We have sufficient size and scale in the market today and see no reason to invest in growth when it comes at the expense of returns. The capital that we do spend will be mostly directed towards improving efficiency, reducing emissions and refurbishing equipment.","I'm frequently asked when will we add hydraulic fracturing capacity again? Let me tell you, I don't see that happening until the market has better supply and demand balance and substantially better pricing. And despite the ongoing market rebalancing I just described, the market conditions are not conducive to adding capacity. In this market we are focused on maintaining the right level of capital spending to support our business. But most importantly, on continuing to deliver strong cash flow and [technical difficulty] returns.","As the North America land market rebalances over the next few quarters, we will continue to control what we can control. We're positioning ourselves to outperform the market even if demand is substantially different from what we currently expect. I already mentioned our CapEx reduction. That was the first step. Second, we're reorganizing our structure in North America land to be more nimble and operate more efficiently. This will make us more effective in any market. Third, I often talk about continuous improvement.","I want to make it clear that this is not a temporary initiative at Halliburton. It's part of who we are as a company. We are constantly looking for ways to eliminate waste and improve productivity in all parts of our organization, from technology to training, from supply chain to field operations. And we will continue to drive cost and capital efficiency throughout our company.","Finally, and most importantly, we are a returns driven organization and where pricing concessions would've pushed returns below an acceptable threshold, we've instead elected to stack equipment, including frac fleets.","Emerging from the industry's focus on cash flow and returns, we see stable growth over a longer period of time. This sustained growth will be good for Halliburton. It will allow us to leverage our supply chain and logistics infrastructure, drive asset velocity, capture efficiencies around our repair and maintenance programs, and implement technologies at scale to reduce costs and increase production. Therefore, we can be more efficient with our investments.","Halliburton is well positioned to navigate the near-term and thrive in the long run. Our company is 100 years old and we got here by evolving with our market and our customers. We will continue to do so in the future.","Turning to international markets, I'm excited by what I see. The international recovery continues to build momentum. Halliburton has gained share in key international markets over the last several years. This gives us a strong base to capitalize on the recovery and we expect high single-digit international revenue growth this year. The international recovery was initially led by the national oil companies and focused on mature fields.","Now the offshore markets are also entering recovery mode as project economics become more attractive. International offshore spending is projected to be up 14% in 2019 and the average offshore international rig count increased 29% year-on-year in the first quarter. A great example of an emerging offshore rebound is our recent win with Shell in Brazil.","In the first quarter we started work on Shell's three-year integrated well construction campaign in the Santos and Campos basins offshore Brazil. These are some of the most complex, but also most prolific basins in the world. Halliburton is excited to collaborate with Shell on the first green shoots of long-term activity recovery in this critical deepwater market.","Middle East activity is increasing, driven by rig additions in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. However, we expect pricing pressures in the Middle East to continue in the near-term. A steady volume of activity and excess equipment capacity in the region continue to drive competitiveness. Going forward, a call on production and tightening spare capacity should lead to positive pricing movements.","The North Sea is showing pricing improvement with available drilling equipment capacity essentially absorbed. However, we expect margin pressure to remain for the first half of the year as we optimize performance on our competitively priced long-term contracts and continue to incur mobilization cost. Activity ramp-up continues across Asia Pacific and Africa with the rig counts in both regions now the highest level since the first quarter of 2015. We are starting to see pockets of pricing improvement in these areas as they come back from the downturn low.","Latin America activity will improve this year driven by Mexico and Argentina. I'm excited about the near-term growth and long-term potential in that region. As we see more capacity tightness internationally and the pipeline of projects progressively expands, we expect to continue demonstrating rational returns driven growth in the international markets. The pricing discussions with our customers in some markets have become more constructive and we expect this momentum to build going into 2020.","As the rationalization of the U.S shale industry unfolds and the international markets ramp-up, Halliburton is best positioned to capitalize on the future opportunities. We make thousands of decisions every day and our global presence, our diversified products and service portfolio, our culture, our processes and our depth of leadership will allow us to win. We will win through responsible capital stewardship, prioritizing capital efficiency, investing in the technologies that deliver differentiation and generating strong cash flow and returns.","I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then I will return to discuss how we are strategically positioned to differentiate ourselves in the current market and deliver returns for our shareholders. Lance?","Lance Loeffler","Thanks, Jeff. Let's begin with an overview of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while adjusted operating income was $426 million, a 31% decrease.","Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 4% and operating income was $368 million, a decrease of 26%. These results were primarily driven by increased stimulation activity in North America, which was offset by lower pricing. The Completion and Production division also benefited from higher artificial lift and cementing activity in U.S land, increased stimulation activity in Latin America and higher completion tool sales in the Middle East\/Asia and Latin America regions.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased 7% to $2.1 billion, driven by activity improvement across all regions. Operating income was $123 million, a decrease of 35%. These results were primarily driven by mobilization cost that we incurred on multiple international drilling projects, coupled with reduced project management activity and lower pricing in the Middle East.","Moving to our geographical results. In North America, revenue decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower pricing in stimulation services, partially offset by higher artificial lift, cementing and stimulation services activity. Latin America revenue increased 28%. This increase was driven by higher activity for the majority of our product service lines in Mexico, increased stimulation work in Argentina and improved fluids activity throughout the region, partially offset by reduced drilling and testing activity in Brazil.","Turning to Europe\/Africa\/CIS, revenue grew 4% driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Ghana and the United Kingdom. These results were partially offset by lower drilling activity in Azerbaijan.","In Middle East\/Asia revenue increased 7% year-over-year, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales across the region, coupled with increased project management activity in India and improved drilling activity in the Middle East. These improvements were offset by reduced fluids activity and lower pricing in the Middle East.","In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. We expect corporate expense in the second quarter to remain approximately the same. During the quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $61 million, primarily related to a non-cash impairment of legacy sand delivery equipment as we've adopted a more efficient sand logistic solution.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $143 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same for the next reporting period. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%. Going forward, we expect our second quarter and 2019 full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was a use of cash of $44 million, primarily driven by short-term working capital movements.","We experienced some customer payment delays that should get resolved as the second quarter progresses. We've also built up inventory primarily for the international rollout of our strategic investments, and we plan to work this inventory down throughout the year. Historically, it's not unusual for our cash flow to the backend loaded and we expect to generate strong operating cash flow for the remainder of 2019.","Capital expenditures during the quarter were $437 million with our 2019 full-year CapEx firm at $1.6 billion. On a full-year basis, we expect to generate higher free cash flow than last year by engaging the appropriate levers in different markets. Optimizing capacity and structure in North America, driving pricing improvements and contract optimization internationally and managing working capital and CapEx.","Now turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the second quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating a second quarter rebound from typical seasonal disruptions in drilling activity, offset by ongoing mobilizations. Therefore, we expect sequential revenue to be up low single digits with margins increasing 50 to 150 basis points.","In our Completion and Production division, with North America land activity improving and the worst in pricing deterioration behind us, we believe that revenues will increase mid single digits, while margin should be up 50 to150 basis points.","Now I will turn the call back over to Jeff to highlight some of our ongoing strategic initiatives and make a few closing comments. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Lance. More than ever we're focused on exercising prudent capital allocation to the right priorities. We have solid long-term strategies aligned with value generation for our shareholders. We will continue to expand in the product service lines and penetrate the markets where we see opportunities to generate growth and returns.","As we implement these strategies, we expect to generate economic and technical differentiation that will lead to higher returns and free cash flow. There are three main areas where we're investing this year and I will walk you through each one of them. First, we will continue to enhance the competitiveness of our Sperry drilling product line.","I\u2019ve talked to you a lot about iCruise, the new rotary steerable platform we introduced last year. The global rollout of this advanced drilling technology is on track with the tool already working in Argentina, the Middle East and across the U.S shale basins. We are currently building out the tool inventory and by the end of 2019, iCruise will constitute over a third of our rotary steerable fleet.","Growth in the higher margin rotary steerable market is extremely encouraging, but conventional motors remain the workhorse of directional drilling, especially on land. Another initiative we undertook at Sperry to increase our competitiveness and differentiation was to launch our Motors Center of Excellence. It is a new approach to drilling motor development that combines specialized engineering and manufacturing capabilities to customize motor designs for specific basin challenges.","The center deploys the latest mechanical engineering expertise to build more durable motors that drill faster and allow for longer runs with a higher rate of penetration. We have assembled a dedicated team of scientists in bearing and power section design, polymer chemistry and materials that is focused on accelerating research and development activities to deliver differentiated drilling motors to the industry.","As part of our Motors Center of Excellence, last quarter we opened two new reline facilities equipped with state-of-the-art technology and strategically located in Houston and Saudi Arabia to serve our customers in the Western and Eastern Hemispheres.","Next we will continue investing in our production businesses, artificial lift and specialty chemicals. They\u2019re critical to both unconventionals and mature fields that fit well within our existing product portfolio and they have a lot of growth potential for Halliburton going forward. This year will be all about international expansion for these businesses. It is already well underway for artificial lift offering. We opened a testing and disassembly facility in the Middle East and are making ESP deliveries in several countries in Latin America and in the Middle East. Plans for international manufacturing of ESPs are in the works as well.","I recently went to Saudi Arabia to attend a groundbreaking ceremony for Halliburton's first chemical manufacturing plant in the Eastern Hemisphere. Leveraging the expertise added through the Athlon acquisition last year, we are building a plant that will provide an advantage location for Halliburton to deliver superior service and chemical applications expertise to our Eastern Hemisphere customers.","Upon completion in 2020, the plant will have capabilities to manufacture a broad slate of chemicals for stimulation, production, midstream and downstream engineered treatment programs. We will not only supply our customers with next generation specialty chemical solutions, but will also be able to manufacture chemicals for our own drilling fluids, cementing and stimulation businesses.","Finally, the third focus area for this year. We will continue to differentiate in a very important, but highly competitive space in hydraulic fracturing. The intense exploration of top-tier acreage, fueled by rapid trial-and-error technology cycles led to the explosive increase in production from US unconventionals that we've seen in the past decade. As Shale matures and operators have to step out to second tier acreage, it will become increasingly hard to add enough production capacity to replace a significant legacy decline volumes as well as drive new production higher.","Going forward, higher activity and more advanced technology will be needed to maintain flat production levels in unconventionals. In light of this, I firmly believe that the future of unconventional technology will be more heavily weighted towards enabling higher well productivity.","As I told you before, Halliburton's first step in this direction is investing in the Prodigi fracturing automation platform. We're using the latest machine learning technology to make our hydraulic fracturing treatment smarter and help our customers achieve optimal production from tougher and deeper rock. Today Prodigi applies automated rate control to more effectively breakdown all perforation clusters. This eliminates human error and yields more consistent fracturing treatments.","On a recent application in North Dakota's Williston basin, Prodigi enabled more even distribution of profit and fluid to each cluster, resulting in a 30% increase in cluster efficiency. This is just the beginning of what Prodigi will provide as we continue to work smarter going forward. And Halliburton is best positioned to develop and deploy the advanced technologies that will ultimately improve well performance.","With shale maturation, capital discipline on both the operator and the services side and an escalating focus on technology and efficiency, we expect customers to demand both surface execution and subsurface effectiveness. It won't just be about getting the most number of stages fracked today. Improving the quality of those stages and their production output will be just as important. In this environment a strong integrated franchise will matter; size and scale matter will matter, technology depth will matter; superior service quality will matter; customer collaboration will matter; and Halliburton has all of these.","In summary, a supply and demand rebalance in North America land over the next few quarters, Halliburton is well positioned to navigate the near-term and thrive in the long run. Second, a broad-based recovery is ongoing internationally and will continue into 2020. Halliburton will keep achieving rational returns driven growth in the international markets.","And finally, against this backdrop, Halliburton is focused on the right things. We're investing in the products and services that generate growth and returns, managing our costs and other operating levers and committed to generating strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns.","And now, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Angie Sedita of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Angeline Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Angie. Welcome back.","Angeline Sedita","Thank you. Glad to be back. So, Jeff, maybe we could touch on your commentary on the worst in pricing is behind us. Is that -- give us a little color there. Does that imply that the pricing pressure is not completely gone? And then, also you touched on your levers to drive margins and of course, utilization and operational efficiency does drive margins in a big way. So can you talk about those levers and how much more you have to pull there?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Angie. The -- I\u2019d say the worst is behind us. That doesn\u2019t mean there's nothing, but it also means that when we look at the market and how it's shaping up, that does -- will there be some trickling effects, potentially I'm not going to give precision around our strategy there. But what I will tell you is that we\u2019re saying no where the thresholds aren't met, which gives me confidence. And then aligning that with what we see around activity and tightening capacity, which all of that should progress as the year goes on and I view that as lending of support to pricing being behind us.","Angeline Sedita","Okay. And so does that -- with the tightening capacity and you talked about the attrition that\u2019s ongoing, do you -- what\u2019s your thoughts on pricing for the back half of the year or is that more of a 2020 event?","Jeff Miller","Yes, again, I'm not going to try to pick the date on where things are. I think broadly though our view is that we will see tightening capacity on the balance throughout the year. I described how hard equipment is working. Also, the capital discipline that our customers see, we see the same and so I think the reduction in CapEx or the actual -- the discipline around CapEx goes a long way to support balancing of the market. Now when does it balance? I think it's more balanced later in the year certainly than it is today. So I think that's all supported.","Angeline Sedita","Okay. And then as a -- unrelated comment, but a follow-up. The reorganization in the U.S land can you give us more color there? Is there a cost savings opportunity for the reorganization or is this more operational changes?","Jeff Miller","Look there's always cost associated with reorganization, but let me focus on making us more efficient and more nimble. So couple of years ago we took a fair amount of cost out, but most of that cost came in the form of an organization that would operate more efficiently and more quickly and it's really what we're doing here. This is not targeted at frontline by any means. What this is more around how do we brighten the lines and more quickly operate, make decisions and go to market. Now efficiency or lower cost is useful in any market in terms of driving performance, but that's not the intent.","Angeline Sedita","Right. Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Jeff Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","James West","Hey, good morning, guys.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, James.","Lance Loeffler","Good morning, James.","James West","So, Jeff and Lance, on North America real quick, I think this is pretty easy to respond to, but one, are you stacking fleets now, if you can't get the appropriate return? And two, are you starting to see a push towards maybe a rebundling, meaning that as the operators have debundled previously when they were spending as much they could, now that their budgets are -- have shrunk in size, perhaps the rebundling, the reorganization, the better collaboration part of the business should start to unfold. I\u2019m curious on both of those topics.","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, James. On the first topic, we did stack equipment in the first quarter and I'm not going to go any further than that, but as we look at the market and look at returns on equipment that causes to make those decisions and we will continue to manage our business around returns. The second question though was around rebundling and look I've always had a view that over time those things that make sense to come back together do. I think we are early days of that, but there is just such an elegance and efficiency around how things fit together. That doesn't mean we're not very competitive with each slice and I think we demonstrated that. But at some point once the pieces and parts have been examined you start to see, wow, it's a lot simpler to put those pieces and parts back together but to come, James, but I feel good about where we are in that process.","James West","Okay. Okay, got it. And then on the international side, Jeff it sounds like you\u2019re a bit more bullish now than you were maybe a quarter ago. I guess, one, is that fair to say? And then, the second is kind of top line looks like it's going to be pretty strong this year. It has been strong, you\u2019ve been outperforming. When do you think the bottom line or the incrementals start to outpace normalized incrementals?","Jeff Miller","Yes, thanks. The -- look, I think what gives me more confidence is how broad-based this recovery looks today. And so we start to see not just a green shoot here and there, but I think as I described in my commentary nearly every region I talked about in terms of some form of growth we also see are broadening base of offshore sort of activity, not maybe activity and also the tendering activity that leads to more activity as we go into 2020. From a margin standpoint, I will focus those comments on D&E, obviously. We expect stronger decrementals as we -- incrementals, excuse me, stronger incremental to clarify that. What we saw in the first quarter, James, was I mean it really was a mix of different things both mobilizations that generally get done at midyear as we move to the year, the mix of services, there's a real pricing impact from the Middle East that we saw, I mean, a lot of the tender activity that happened in '18, it all started in earnest on January 1 of this year. So we saw some of that.","James West","Okay.","Jeff Miller","But what\u2019s important, I think is, we expect strong incrementals in the Q2 for that business and clearly Q1 in my view is a bottom for D&E margins.","James West","Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Lance.","Jeff Miller","Thank you.","Lance Loeffler","Thanks, James.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Judson Bailey","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Judson.","Judson Bailey","Hey, Jeff, you started off your comments by saying what a difference 90 days makes and that\u2019s probably appropriate. Could you maybe talk about how you\u2019ve seen the year progress from -- I'm sticking to North America and how maybe customer tone or conversations have changed, and to the extent visibility over the next couple of quarters, or even the back half of the year has or has not improved as the macro environment has kind of stabilized here?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think the macro environment stabilizing is the key point. I mean in 90 days ago, we were coming off what was -- wasn't a clear path for commodity prices, obviously Q4 was pretty hard on everyone. So in the range of 90 days, commodity price set up. What we had thought would happen has happened in terms of customers going back to work. And as I said in my commentary, sort of each month was progressively building and that shapes our view. You know as we talk with customers, we look at the calendar, those things are all constructive as we look out to the next couple of quarters. More specifically around the second half of the year, a couple of ways we think about that, but I think importantly, is the production targets that are out there today, all of that require some level of completion activity to meet that. I also think that some part of the CapEx reduction gets captured in sort of other things, that\u2019s -- whether it's sand or service price deflation and maybe lowering rig count a bit. And I think the last question really be around, what do the smaller operators do going into the back half of the year? And I think they may be the most opportunistic, it's most important to them also just with the smaller asset base investing in completions really matters a lot to the value, not just of the asset, but likely the company.","Judson Bailey","Okay. I appreciate the color there. And my follow-up is maybe for Lance. Your guidance on C&P revenues up mid single digits, my impression is that pricing is still on average a bit of a headwind as we head into the second quarter. Can you maybe give us your thoughts on how much the lag effect from the pricing weakness throughout 1Q impacts how C&P revenue growth looks in the second quarter? Just trying to balance what\u2019s the volume and what\u2019s -- what the headwind on pricing is?","Lance Loeffler","Yes, I think -- thanks, Jud. I think the -- it kind of goes back to what Jeff was saying maybe an earlier comment, I think you may see some of the trickling effect to continue from the pricing side, but it's more than offset by the level of activity that we see, which is what informs our guidance, so it's really volume related with some modest impact from pricing.","Judson Bailey","Okay. All right. I appreciate the color. I will turn it back.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.","William Herbert","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeff Miller","Hi, Bill.","William Herbert","Good morning. Jeff, when you speak about the second half, is this -- and your frac calendar specifically, is this based upon specific visibility, which is populating the frac calendar or kind of a plausible expectation that completions needs to move higher even, I mean, for any number of reasons including meeting customer budgets, filling Permian pipes etcetera? So distinguish between optionality and actually tangible visibility that\u2019s unfolding.","Jeff Miller","Yes, Bill, the -- we've got visibility in the calendar out a couple of quarters and so we've got a view of that and that's more specific. As we look further in the year, particularly the back half, I think there are some sign posts that we look for in terms of production targets met, not met, also around rig count with smaller operators, what that may look like. And I think that cadence also could be different in different basins, but I think we obviously have discussions with customers and I think there's -- it's quite a mixed bag in terms of outlook and how they plan to manage activity throughout the year, but we are asking those kind of questions certainly earlier than we have in the past and I feel like with our business development organization and ability to be very sharp around the edges in terms of where we\u2019re and how we perform, I feel confident in at least Halliburton's outlook for the balance of the year.","William Herbert","Okay. Thank you. And then with regard to international margins, it seems like at least in the ordering the elements conspiring to weaker D&E margins in Q1 that the major issue with this was the mobilization expense associated with several different drilling projects, that\u2019s a transient issue. So I\u2019m curious as to when the mobilization -- well, first of all, how broad was the mobilization headwind in Q1 apart from the North Sea? Secondly, when does that abate? And thirdly, doesn't that represent a nice margin opportunity in the second half of the year?","Lance Loeffler","Yes, Bill. This is Lance. Look, I think there's opportunity and we do expect D&E margins to improve throughout the course of the year. I think we've been pretty vocal around that. While the mobilization sure will provide that uplift, it's not to discount the pricing pressure that we continue to see in the Middle East.","William Herbert","Okay.","Lance Loeffler","Right. I mean -- so, as we get through the first half of this year, we expect D&E margins to be markedly improved in the second half to sort of land at flat year-over-year margins in D&E.","William Herbert","Okay. So it's flat year-over-year margins for FY19 or second half versus second half?","Lance Loeffler","Flat year -- FY19.","William Herbert","Okay. Thank you very much, sir.","Lance Loeffler","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Scott Gruber","Yes, good morning.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Scott.","Lance Loeffler","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gruber","Jeff, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the U.S market is likely settling into one that\u2019s less volatile, which would be good for you. It sounds like mainly a demand comment and obviously there's only so much you can control. Have you thought about ways of further reducing the volatility from your side, and how do you think about customer exposure? Does the growth of the majors presents an opportunity to tender into some contracts, which maybe stickier and longer term? Is there an ability to look at the E&Ps, given that they are settling into a spending cadence that maybe steadier? Is there an ability to go after some longer term deals with them? How do you think about overall reducing the volatility in the business?","Jeff Miller","Yes, without going into like specific things that we do, I mean, what you\u2019re saying, obviously, we think about that. We\u2019ve historically -- and look we do a lot of business with IOCs, we do a lot of business with all -- all of the customers in the marketplace along different of those 14 service lines that we have. But we\u2019ve -- historically, we've optimized our frac fleet around what we view as the most efficient customers, we could drive the most margin. But I also think with the industrialization of shale sort of at scale, larger scale today, those types of things become more attractive and so we\u2019ve good relationships, we\u2019ve the ability to scale to those growth plans. And look and we plan -- plan to do so, but we're going to do it always with an eye to what are the best returns for our shareholders.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And then you mentioned 20% efficiency gains in frac over the last two years, how should we think about those gains in '19 and '20? Are you seeing efficiency improvement on par is starting to slow, just some color on that trend as well would be great.","Jeff Miller","Yes, I think we are seeing that. Through a degree we are reaching some sort of maximum velocity here just in terms of hours a day. If I would think back there have been some big sort of milestones in efficiency when Halliburton has been at the front edge of each of those. So the first was going from 12 to 24-hour a day operations, that was a big step. Next was more around zipper fracs as opposed to single well fracs and then multi-well pads as opposed to single well pads. All of those are sort of structural step changes. We\u2019ve done a lot at the margin around being more efficient and our focus is taking capital off location not putting more capital on location. And so we do some things to drive our capital efficiency, but the big steps, I don\u2019t necessarily see those today. What I really see over the next cycle or the next few years is more emphasis around what\u2019s happening around the well bore as opposed to on surface and you hear a lot of discussion around that. But I say that to include everything from parent child, the spacing, the velocity, the all of these other things that we believe and I believe will have more impact on productivity and efficiency over the next three, five years.","Scott Gruber","If you had to put a number on the efficiency improvement this year, what would you peg it at?","Jeff Miller","I don't know. Less than it's been. I would just call it 5%, 10% maybe in that range.","Scott Gruber","Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.","Jeff Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Sean Meakim","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Sean.","Lance Loeffler","Sean.","Sean Meakim","So you mentioned, you've got a lot of different levers to drive cash flow depending on what the market gives you. I think a lot of your 2019 CapEx budget was committed prior to the reduction that you took end of the year. So, conceptually, if 2020 looks a lot like 2019, in other words, activity in North America is comparable, international's improving modestly, could your CapEx budget take another cut lower as some of the recent growth initiatives in Drilling & Production start to roll off?","Lance Loeffler","Yes, thanks Sean. Look, I think in terms of the sort of CapEx to revenue relationship that we sit at today, I believe it was like high 6% is lower than it's been on average over the last 10 years where we've averaged closer to 10%. I think, clearly this year, we've been pretty vocal about what buckets we're out spending as a part of that $1.6 billion of CapEx. I don't know that that -- to me, it feels like in and around 7% today, feels like a good number even for next year. Now the slices of that pie, right, as we go -- as we think about how we invest may change, but I think the rate of CapEx spend as we reinvest in the business feels pretty good.","Jeff Miller","Well, maybe just step in there too. I mean when we think about the outlook. I mean, we are focused on what I would call returns focused growth. And so if we think about where we are spending this year, we are continuing to invest in strategic initiatives and we are building out sort of our Sperry iCruise fleet and investing in international growth. So we are doing all of that today, sort of in and round where we and sort of the 7% -- 6%, 7% of revenues today. So it feels sustainable to me and I don't see this as a shift in our approach. I mean in this market, that level of spend is appropriate to generate returns.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Thank you for that feedback. And just one point of clarification, when you highlighted pricing pressure in the Middle East, is it -- were you considering this to be incremental pressure from customers, or is this really just a rolling through of contracts that were won last year?","Jeff Miller","Well, it's -- principally, what we see in this quarter is the rolling over or the establishment beginning of contracts at lower prices. It doesn't necessarily mean that it's abated. But it is certainly that's what we are seeing now, somewhere in the -- as we look ahead, we will work on how to optimize things and perform more profitably over time.","Sean Meakim","And so, would you say that -- would you characterize the magnitude of the decline due to the mobilization and that pricing basically in line with what you would've expected for the quarter?","Jeff Miller","Yes, that's -- no that's what we\u2019ve generally thought we'd see and we also saw a number of things that I described in my comments with mobilization, that pricing, also weather in the North Sea was pretty tough this quarter more so than probably we'd have expected. So those sorts of things.","Sean Meakim","Very good. Okay, thank you.","Lance Loeffler","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jeff Miller","Chase, are you there?","Operator","Please check your mute button. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, I just had a follow-up question here. When you guys are talking about the overall spending activity -- spending levels for the U.S being down 6% to 10% and for international kind of be up high single digits, when we look at say Completion and Production and we look at Drilling and Evaluation, would it be safe to assume that in aggregate Completion and Production would be up, like you say completion activity be up, so I would imagine that overall C&P revenues to be up on a year-on-year basis, maybe in that high single-digit range, and think adversely on Drilling and Evaluation with the drilling activity being down in the U.S., that kind of offsetting growth internationally. So I just wanted to try to get a general sense, so C&P up kind of on a year-on-year revenue and D&E maybe kind of flattish. Is that kind of a safe way to think about it right now?","Lance Loeffler","The way that I would think about it, Kurt, is that -- I mean and we've mentioned this I think in some of our prepared remarks was that we expect our completions activity to be sort of flat year-over-year, right? Even though spend is down in North America, that takes the form of lower sand pricing or lower drilling expenditures versus the actual completions activity. And then as we think about D&E, particularly driven by the international markets, we see a broad recovery, pockets of pricing improvement, but also weighed down by pretty competitive Middle East today. So it's a balance of all of that.","Kurt Hallead","Got it. I appreciate that, Lance. And then, Jeff, maybe follow-up for you. I know you've had a very continuous focus on returns and that being the key mantra, one of the key mantras for the company. I was wondering if you could give us some perspectives on how you think about return thresholds and when you think about it in the context, is it -- when you think about our through cycle, is that a 3-year period, 5-year period, 10-year period, kind of some general insights on that dynamic would be helpful.","Jeff Miller","Look, when I think about returns, broadly, I think the -- I think about sustained growth over a period of time and I also believe that the value for growth at any cost is over and so when we will talk about returns focused growth, that\u2019s the right kind of growth. And look, I feel great about Halliburton in this kind of paradigm. I mean, we've always been returns focused, clearly it starts with margins, so improving pricing and managing costs, we are always managing costs in that environment. And then I think disciplined investing, I think that maybe informs more of what you're asking, but we make capital scarce when we need to make capital scarce and we are also and might be investing in the right businesses. So if we think about lift and chemicals and where we've put our CapEx, we will do that very thoughtfully and certainly focused on returns.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up just on the attrition comment, Jeff, you referenced earlier that 7.5 million horsepower will need to be rebuilt in '19 and you wouldn't think the spending level required to rebuild that equipment would happen. So in the context of attrition then, how much horsepower do you think could shake out of the market this year?","Lance Loeffler","Kurt, this is Lance. I think it's tough to call -- hard to really put a number on it, right? I mean, I think attrition has always been a tough one to try to define in the pressure pumping industry. But one that we know it's happening because we see what it's -- how it's working on our fleet, right and we talked about some of the stats that we had in our prepared remarks, you can't ignore it. And today we know that there's under-investment. We know that there's more pressure than ever on all of the fleet in North America around wear and tear and therefore the repair and maintenance costs associated with it and the burden that a lot of our space has had to shoulder it, I think, look, at the end of the day, there's going to be some that are just going to flat out, be retired.","Kurt Hallead","Got it. Right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Lance Loeffler","Thanks, Kurt.","Jeff Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Boyd","Hey, thanks, guys.","Jeff Miller","Hi, Dan.","Dan Boyd","One of the follow-up on the international outlook, you put up a 11% growth in the first quarter, the guide for the second quarter sounds like about 10% first half growth year-on-year and presumably the mobilization costs you are calling out suggests continued growth in the back half. So just wondering what keeps you with a little bit more of a conservative high single-digit revenue number for the year?","Jeff Miller","Look, we want to be very realistic about what we see unfolding in the market. I think the -- a lot of the tender activity that we see today is probably not going to begin until 2020 and so we see activity building, but we are also going to be -- I\u2019ve talked about returns focused growth. And that\u2019s part of that discussion is making sure that we are investing and pursuing the right things. And look, we are really encouraged. In fact, I think what we will see is growth as I described in '19 and then certainly building into 2020 as sort of that broad based sort of offshore activity starts as opposed to being tendered and talked about. So encouraged, but again, we are going to manage our business.","Dan Boyd","Yes, just being conservative. Lance, I wanted to follow-up on Bill's question on the D&E margins. So, in order to keep them flat year-on-year it sounds like we need to exit the year in the fourth quarter low double digits. And so just wondering as you look past mobilization cost that you are incurring, is that a number that you sort of see without pricing and without big contract wins from here on out, but basically is how de-risked is that low double-digit margin?","Lance Loeffler","Well, look, I mean we are going to have to work towards it, no doubt. But I think the tailwind that you get as you begin to put revenues across the costs that we\u2019ve been running and around the actions that we are taking in the North Sea and those mobilizations, I also think that we expect to start to see some benefit as we get more Sperry tools in the market. I think we told you that a third of the Sperry fleet will be iCruise by the end of the year, we are working hard to get those tools out, that\u2019s part of the working capital build that you saw on the inventory side that I mentioned in my commentary around the international strategic investments and so those are the things that give me confidence that we can continue to build on what we need to get to those commitments.","Dan Boyd","All right. Thank you.","Lance Loeffler","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Marc Bianchi","Hi. Thank you. First question just back to the pricing discussion for North America, Jeff, you noted the 14 product service lines that Halliburton offers. Is there any distinction among those lines in terms of where pricing is bottoming, specifically everybody is focused on frac, but as you mentioned you are a big player in cementing, there's been some concern about cementing competition. Just curious if there's any distinction you could offer on those product lines?","Jeff Miller","Yes, I\u2019m going to -- it's a very competitive space in North America so I\u2019m not going to get any more detailed around pricing and where the other service lines are. Clearly, hydraulic fracturing is probably the biggest piece of sort of the North America landscape today and it probably is the most over supplied, so I will leave it at that.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Lance, in terms of the outlook for free cash flow growth for the year, big working capital consumption here in the first quarter, which is seasonal. Would you anticipate working capital for the year to be a neutral, a positive, or negative?","Lance Loeffler","Well, I think we are going to see a lot of benefit as we sort of work through the DSOs that we\u2019ve built up in the first quarter of the year, I think we will continue to work down a lot of the inventory that we built up, I would suspect that -- the working capital does release cash some point throughout the year.","Marc Bianchi","Okay, super. Thanks so much.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Marc.","Lance Loeffler","Thanks, Marc.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thank you, Candice. Before we wrap up the call, I would just like to highlight a few points. First, I\u2019m excited about the broad-based international recovery that we see unfolding and Halliburton is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. Second, I believe that demand for North America completions will be up modestly over the next few quarters and that capacity will tighten over the balance of the year. Finally, our focus on capital discipline, capacity tightening, and cost management will deliver leading returns and free cash flow in excess of last year. Look, I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Candice, please close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

And welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton's second quarter 2014 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay would be available on Halliburton's Web site for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, COO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Forms 10K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave, Dave?","Dave Lesar","","Thank you Kelly and good morning everyone. I am obviously very pleased with our second quarter results and here are the headlines, record company revenue this quarter of $8.1 billion, double-digit sequential revenue growth and new quarterly records in both North America and Middle East\/Asia. We once again delivered industry-leading revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year compared to our primary peers. We had strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and our Board has approved an increase in our buyback authorization to $6 billion.","I am also pleased to announce the promotion of Jeff Miller to President and his appointment to Halliburton\u2019s Board, effective August 1st. I\u2019ve known and worked with Jeff for 25 years and I am absolutely confident he will do an excellent job leading our very strong management team. Now for some details around our performance this quarter, company operating income increased 23% sequentially, led by a 31% increase in North America operating income, with an impressive 280 basis point improvement in margins to 18.2%.","The Eastern hemisphere had an equally impressive 220 basis point margin improvement to 16% resulting from a 26% growth in operating income. Now on our last call some of you may have been skeptical when I said I was beginning to feel the turn in North America, but based on our performance during the quarter I believe this feeling was dead on target. Today we are not feeling the turn, we are in the turn and I feel even more excited than I was last quarter about the outlook for the North American market.","Why is that? During the quarter we saw our completion volumes continue to rise and I don\u2019t see that changing. Our logistics infrastructure is more of a differentiator than ever before. We were successful in getting cost recovery from our customers. And we estimate the percentage of excess horsepower has dropped below the 10% mark and capacity has tightened to the point that the market will require new horsepower to meet customer demand.","As you know, based on the competitive advantage of our Frac of the Future, our plan has always been to upgrade our fleet to Q10s over time. These current trends provide us confidence that now is the appropriate time to accelerate our Q10 build schedule. We anticipate incremental fleets arriving in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. We\u2019ve also been investing to increase our logistics capability as well. I am confident that these are the right moves. So even in the unlikely event the market softens, we always have the option of accelerating the retirement schedule of older equipment and replacing them with Q10s.","Now moving to our international operations, Eastern Hemisphere activity continues to expand at the steady rate that we expected. But you know what, steady is exciting for us because it demonstrates that our view of the market was the correct one and that we are sized and scoped correctly to turn industry-leading revenue growth into steadily increasing margins. Our outlook for the full year remains intact. We are still targeting our Eastern Hemisphere revenue growth to be in the low double-digits with average full year margins in the upper-teens and approaching 20% by the end of the year. Second quarter margins of 16% show we are on-track to deliver that.","Turning to Latin America, we faced issues around revenue timing during the quarter. Now it\u2019s easy for me to give my head around the issues, and I can see a path forward to normalized profitability. But I am certainly not thrilled with how some of the things played out this quarter; first, there was an issue with the late receipt of our software consulting blanket order from PEMEX, which impacted our ability to book revenue to offset our costs, which of course significantly hurt second quarter results. This should reverse itself in the second half of the year. Second, we were mobilizing for two large integrated projects which resulted in cost, but minimal revenue, for the quarter. This also should reverse itself in the second half of the year. Lastly, the rig count approached a 10 year low and social disruptions impacted operations resulting in reduced discrete service activity in Mexico.","However, we remain encouraged by the prospect of energy reform in Mexico and believe that as the market gains more certainty around the direction of reform future service activity will increase. And in Brazil we are pleased with our customers\u2019 decision to re-tender the deepwater drilling contract, which should allow us to right-size our footprint there. So looking at the full year, we continue to target 2014 Latin America margins to be in line with the prior year at approximately 13%.","Now let me be clear about one thing, and I\u2019ve been around long enough to know, headwinds become tailwinds therefore I am optimistic about our future growth potential in Latin America as we go into 2015. So our overall strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. Our leadership position in North America positions us well to capture the upside of this exciting and quickly evolving market, and we are continuing to realize significant revenue and margin expansion in our international business. We remain dead focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry-leading shareholder returns to you.","Now I am going to turn the call over to Mark to provide financial details. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks Dave and good morning. Let me begin with an overview of our second quarter results. Starting with North America, revenues were up 11% sequentially relative to a 4% increase in U.S. land rig count. And operating income was up 31% over the same period. Margins increased to 18.2%. Stronger activity levels in U.S. land primarily drove the improvement for the quarter. Margins also benefited from modest pricing improvements on pressure pumping contract renewals, which were designed to cover inflation on specific cost categories such as transportation, fuel and labor. These improvements were partially offset by the Canadian spring breakup and lower sequential profitability in the Gulf of Mexico due to the timing of completions activity.","In the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue and operating income increased sequentially by 9% and 26% respectively, as a result of growth in both the Middle East\/Asia and Europe\/Africa\/ CIS regions. We experienced a seasonal rebound in revenue and margins after encountering typical first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and Australia.","In our Middle East\/Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 25% respectively compared to the first quarter. Saudi Arabia showed strong sequential improvement driven by our consulting, directional drilling and drilling fluids product lines. We are very excited about this market and continue to see revenue and profitability improving at a very aggressive rate. Additionally, we continue to see solid growth across the majority of our Asia Pacific countries with Australia, Malaysia and China leading the pack for the quarter.","The current situation in Iraq has resulted in some logistics bottlenecks and increased security measures but our operations which are in Southern Iraq and in Kurdistan are away from the fighting and are continuing. We continue to expect the Middle East region to have the highest growth rate for the full year 2014 despite the potential for activity disruptions in Iraq later this year. However, contract renewals and tenders for new work in Iraq are currently being pushed back which may mute our growth expectations as we exit the year.","Turning to Europe\/Africa\/CIS, revenue and operating income increased 6% and 27% respectively compared to the prior quarter. The seasonal activity rebound in the North Sea and Russia led to sequential improvement. Additionally, sub-Saharan Africa showed sequential improvement, led by drilling activity gains in Angola and higher completions, intervention in pipeline processing services in Nigeria, Ghana and Congo.","The Russia sanctions have not had a material impact on our activity levels up to this point, but there is some risk related to certain projects that are being tendered later this year. Latin America revenue increased 4% sequentially while operating income declined by 39%. Despite double-digit revenue improvement this quarter in Venezuela, Argentina and Colombia, we were negatively impacted by project mobilization and the blanket order delays in Mexico which Dave previously discussed.","Our corporate and other expense totaled $107 million for the quarter, a little higher than anticipated, driven by retirement cost and higher professional fees. We invested approximately $15 million in our HALvantage strategic initiative during the second quarter. These activities should wrap-up this next quarter. We anticipate that corporate expenses for the third quarter will run approximately $90 million to $100 million.","Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 28%. For the remainder of 2014, we are expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%.","Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately 18% compared to the first quarter. Excluding the $215 million in acquisitions made this quarter, we have generated approximately $356 million in cash and marketable securities during the quarter. As we progress through 2014, we believe we are well-positioned to generate significantly more cash and that our cash flow will continue to grow in the coming years. As a reminder, we are working to grow the percentage of cash available for distribution to shareholders to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which is nearly double our historic average.","As discussed, we intend to accelerate our Q10 build schedule and expand our logistics infrastructure. As a result we now expect that our 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of $300 million compared to our previous guidance. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion during 2014.","Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook, in the third quarter we are anticipating a mid single-digit percentage improvement in revenue and we expect margins to migrate modestly higher into the upper-teens. Revenue is expected to continue to step higher in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our strongest quarter of the year with margins approaching 20%. We continue to expect full year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits and margins averaging in the upper-teens.","In Latin America, we expect mid-teen sequential revenue expansion in the third quarter and believe margins should approach the mid-teens. With continued improvement in revenue and margins in the fourth quarter, as a result we expect full year revenue and margins to be in line with 2013. However, our second half outlook assumes the timely approval of our billings under the blanket order in Mexico, as well as a swift resolution of the retender of our Brazil drilling contract.","And concluding with North America, we are expecting revenue growth in the third quarter to outpace the rig count with North America margins approaching 20%. While we expect the rig count to continue to increase, utilization levels are very high and growth in the third quarter could be constrained by the availability of equipment until incremental fleets begin to arrive later in the year.","Now I will turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","","Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. Our strategy is in the deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals are clearly delivering results. These led not only to record company revenues, but also quarterly revenue records for our production enhancement, baroid, cementing, wireline, production chemicals and artificial lift product lines. So for today\u2019s comments, I\u2019ll focus on our execution against these three strategies. Recall that our unconventional strategy is to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent through surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight.","Let\u2019s start with surface efficiency. We\u2019re seeing record activity levels with year-over-year stage counts up more than 20% and profit volumes per well up about 35%. We also saw record sales of our drill well plugs for plug-and-perf operations, as well as record installations of our RapidSuite sliding sleeve technology. All of these indicators point to larger volume jobs which is precisely for the Q10 pump excels consistently delivering 20% higher flow rates with about 50% lower maintenance cost than a legacy pump.","And one last comment on North America surface efficiency regarding profit and infrastructure, while we see sufficient quantities of sand at the mines, the transportation infrastructure has and will continue to experience unprecedented levels of congestion. And we see profit competing for delivery not only with other profit types, but also with oil and agricultural products. And while we\u2019re not immune to this impact, we\u2019re confident that we have the best developed logistics infrastructure and we plan to continue adding to this capability throughout the year.","Moving on to subsurface insight, we continue to gain traction with our CYPHER platform that optimizes where to drill, how to drill, where to frac and how to frac to make better wells. CYPHER applications continue to grow with over 50 projects underway across more than a dozen basins globally, which makes me even more excited about our recent release of CYPHER 2.0. That refines our earth modeling capability, increases our simulation accuracy and allows real-time adjustments during frac treatments.","And finally our Custom Chemistry solutions are helping deliver better wells. Our AccessFrac diversion technology, clean breaking PermStim and our RockPerm formation analysis have all demonstrated better production for our clients. For example AccessFrac has delivered on average 20% better performance than offset wells with market uptake tripling since last year. RockPerm was first introduced only one year ago, as a means to enhance production through better hydrocarbon mobility and it\u2019s now used in more than one-third of our North American completions.","And as we work across every basin we get to see the different methods used in all of those basins. And even as volume trends emerge our new techniques gain popularity we\u2019re more convinced than ever. The customized frac design and customized fluid chemistry delivered better, sustainable production for our clients.","Now turning to the mature field space, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of our large IPM and asset management projects. During the quarter, we were either rewarded or began mobilizing on large integrated projects in India, Kuwait, UAE and Indonesia. For example our 93 well integrated project with Cairn India, is the first IPM project in India to employ tier 1 land rigs. These projects and other provide us with a strong platform for growth in addition to a pursuit pipeline of over 30 billion in project management opportunities that we\u2019re currently evaluating.","And during the quarter, we started on the multi-decade Humapa incentivized asset management project in Mexico. Early work over operations have been successful and the production levels are already well ahead of schedule in the project. We expect to spud new wells in this asset during the second half of 2014, bringing up to two rigs by the end of the year. Also in Mexico, we spud at our first well in the Mesozoic project in late June and expect our second well to spud in late July. Our Mesozoic project represents a $1 billion opportunity over the next few years.","We plan to mobilize additional rigs over the next several quarters moving towards four rigs by early 2015. And during the second quarter, we expanded our artificial lift capabilities through the acquisition of Europump, an industry leader in progressive cavity pump systems. This acquisition is an important step forward in our artificial lift strategy which complements our existing electric submersible pump technology and positions us to benefit from this growing market. Overall we\u2019re very pleased with the progress of our mature field strategy. The Europump acquisition expands our discrete service offerings and we\u2019re confident in our ability to execute on these large integrated projects.","Looking at deepwater, we continue to increase reliability and reduce uncertainty for our customers. As we introduced new technology, we\u2019re dramatically simplifying equipment design to increase the operability of the equipment. Examples include our full suite of high pressure open hole logging tools designed for the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our new ultra deepwater subsea control system Dash EH which is integrated with Veto, Halliburton\u2019s premiere 3-inch 15k Subsea Safety System that performs emergency well shut-in and critical landing stream disconnect in less than 15 seconds. Specific to the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to see incremental deepwater activity for the balance of the year and an increase in lower tertiary rate completions in early 2015. In the third quarter, we expect to begin operations on an integrated deepwater project for a major customer providing drilling and completion services across multiple wells.","During the second quarter, we also acquired Neftex Petroleum Consultants, a market leader in reducing uncertainly in basins the world over. Neftex has created a unique 4-D model of the subsurface already used by E&P companies worldwide to evaluate and identify resources more quickly and more accurately. We expect this acquisition will touch all three of our key strategies by integrating data and interpretations from the Neftex Earth Model with Landmark\u2019s DecisionSpace platform. We expect to be able to accelerate our customer\u2019s ability to explore prospects and increase our ability to predict drilling success.","In closing, I want to be clear that our strategies are working. We continue to see strong long-term growth opportunities across unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. In fact I would like to highlight the performance of our Eastern Hemisphere where we\u2019ve see revenue expand by more than 50% over the last three years with margins stair-stepping higher year-after-year. This has been a consistent focus on our three key themes that is driven this success.","In mature fields, we are now the leading surface provider of primary customer against Norway driven by our focus on both discrete and integrated solutions. In unconventionals, we are the leading provider of unconventional services in Australia and recently into joint venture to expand our footprint in China. In deepwater, we have seen tremendous growth with all product lines drawing baroid fluids in Asia Pacific, creating a testing business almost from scratch, and a completions business that is now number one globally. Looking ahead, with the projects we have in place and the technology we\u2019re putting to work, we are very optimistic about our growth prospects for the Eastern Hemisphere in the coming years.","Before I hand the call back to Dave one final note, it is truly a privilege to serve as President of Halliburton. I have been part of the management team for several years and I have been part of developing our current strategies, so you should expect us to stay the course and remain dead focused on superior growth, margins, and returns. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Board and the over 80,000 Halliburton employees for their steadfast support.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?","Dave Lesar","Thanks, Jeff. In North America, we are past feeling the turn, we are in the turn and we will be accelerating our Q10 build in the order to meet customer demand. In Latin America, we feel optimistic about improved second half, but are still monitoring a few potential headwinds regardless of that 2015 is shaping up to be a strong year.","In the Eastern Hemisphere, we are still on-track for low-double digit full year revenue growth with margins averaging in the upper-teens. And finally, our strong outlook for the business provides us with confidence in improving increase shareholder returns going forward as is evidenced by our increase in stock buyback authorization to a new total of $6 billion, which represents approximately 10% of our market cap today.","With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Great, thank you. Good morning.","Dave Lesar","Hi Kurt good morning. ","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Maybe a question for either Dave or Jeff with respect to the re-tendering on Brazil, when do you think you might get the bids opened and how do you expect to see that playing out going forward I guess in the context of you still expect to be awarded in the same package that you were awarded before?","Jeff Miller","Yes thanks, Kurt. That rebid is in process right now, so the documents haven\u2019t been resubmitted. We still expect to see that conclude this year, expect early Q4. With respect to competitive positioning I am not going to share that with you here, I expect it will be competitive but in any case expect to see a healthy reset as we look ahead into the \u201915 and beyond.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. My follow-up relates to the U.S. frac business and the accelerated deployment of the Q10 pumps and I\u2019m sure you are aware of increased equipment orders by other players in the market. Can you help us calibrate what this may mean as it relates to the potential for pricing? You think it\u2019s going to be more of a volume driven market or you think there\u2019s an opportunity to get some price as time goes on?","Jeff Miller","","Yes, Kurt let me just kind of go through what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace with respect to activity. We\u2019re seeing all the right signs as capacity starts to tighten which we\u2019ve seen fall below sort of 10% spare capacity. We see activity increasing at breakneck rate, we\u2019re seeing some pass through of cost increases at this point and probably most importantly we have clarity of our frac calendar through the end of the year. So all of those things give it a lot of confidence in adding our equipment because we see where that\u2019s going to go work. I think from a -- if you think more broadly about the market, again we believe in our equipment, it\u2019s doing exactly what we thought it would do, what we described at our Analyst Day so from Halliburton\u2019s perspective very confident that the Q10 equipment is delivering.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","","Alright, thanks, I appreciate it.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now opened. Angie please check your mute button.","Angie Sedita - UBS","","Thanks, good morning guys.","Dave Lesar","","Hey Angie.","Angie Sedita - UBS","","So on the Q10 roll out is there is any constraints in adding this incremental equipment if you want to accelerate it even further and can you talk about how much you\u2019re adding incrementally as far as percentage wise from you what you were adding at the beginning of the year?","Jeff Miller","","Yes, thanks Angie. From a competitive standpoint we\u2019re not going to share with you quantities of equipment and that sort of thing. But suffice to say that we have the ability, that\u2019s one of the reasons we stay in the manufacturing business, it gives us the ability to flex more quickly and then put the equipment when and where we need it.","Angie Sedita - UBS","","So there\u2019s no constraints in adding equipment at a more accelerated rate if you want to even up it from here or do you have any constraints in the system? And then to add to that on the legacy equipment, is it fair to say that all retirements will stop at this time or are you still seeing some retirements at the older equipment?","Mark McCollum","","Hey Angie, this is Mark. Just so I oversee the capital side let me weigh in, we did during the second quarter stop the retirement of some of our equipment just because of the activity levels were so great; we were rolling Q10s out, the ability to leave some of the older equipment out there allowed us to basically gain a spread or so to sort of address some of that activity. From a capital standpoint we\u2019re building to contract. We\u2019re building to what we can see. There is the ability to dial that further if the market accelerates further, but we think that this build schedule is aggressive enough to make sure that we\u2019re addressing the market as we see it that will be available for Halliburton over the next 18 months or so.","Angie Sedita - UBS","","Okay, helpful and then as a follow-up, you mentioned it briefly in your remarks, on the cost recoveries are you now seeing that in every instance, are there still some regions of pushback and I believe you signed a new agreement earlier this year that would actually reduce your sand cost and that you\u2019re also doubling your rail fleet as far as your ownership of the rail fleet, could both of these start to help margins in Q3 or is it more Q4 2015?","Jeff Miller","","Yes, Angie, to address the first part of the question which is really what are we seeing across the entirety of North America. It\u2019s not all the same in terms of tightness, nor is it the same in terms of cost. So the ability to get the cost pass throughs, we\u2019re able to do that where we see that kind of inflation. The second part of your question around logistics, truly a place where we have a lot of confidence in our ability and our supply chain organization has a great window into the market in terms of how to acquire the inputs and as you suggested, or as we\u2019ve said in our comments, we\u2019ll continue to build the logistics capability that we have, and so that\u2019ll -- across a number of different parts of that supply chain.","Angie Sedita - UBS","","Great, thanks, I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now opened.","","Jim Crandell - Cowen and Company","Thank you. Just to follow-up on the pricing question, cost pass-throughs are usually the first step and you went out of your way to say that there\u2019s less than 10% excess capacity in the industry which seemingly sets a stage for real pricing increases and as we know your prices are well below where they were at the peak of the last cycle, when do you see it -- do you see it, and if so when do you see it coming, going from more of a cost recovery to real price increase environment in domestic pressure pumping?","Jeff Miller","","Yes, Jim, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to give you a date or a time in that case, what best I can do is describe the conditions precedent which is what we\u2019re seeing; recall oil cycles are a little different than gas cycles in terms of spikiness, so -- but we -- our build schedule and sort of our view into the market gives us a lot of confidence around kind of that what we see for the balance of this year and in \u201915.","Jim Crandell - Cowen and Company","Okay. And do you see - last cycle as I recall when you were building equipment, you would not add equipment unless you sold the least four other services along with the stimulation equipment, do you have a similar strategy now this year and will you be requiring your customers to order at least three or four product lines?","Jeff Miller","Jim we see pull through on services consistently I mean that\u2019s part of our value proposition in terms of how we go to work most efficiently from a competitive standpoint I am not going to get into the requirement or where we are in that cycle but we are confident that the package of services that we put to work really work well together particularly as the market gets tighter and busier.","Jim Crandell - Cowen and Company","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","No. Thank you. And apologize if I ask a question that might have been answered already as that line dropped off. But there is a question in terms of the capacity of how it\u2019s going to tighter in the market. How much of this do you think is due to seasonally smaller because you guys haven\u2019t had a lot of extra backup on wells and also we have a co-refurbishment cycle which I think is probably starting to kick in. Is that playing a factor in terms of the market tightening up to kind of less than 10% of excess capacity now?","Dave Lesar","Well volume matters a lot, and so our strategy has been to build equipment into the market that handles a lot of volume, and handles the volume more efficiently than competing equipment in the market. So, what we\u2019re seeing it shape up in terms of tightness which is a function of volume, size of jobs that we have described plays right to us. I think that\u2019s -- so anyway it gives us a lots of confidence in the direction both the markets going and where we are.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","So do you need less backup capacity on a given well than your competitors? Can you give us some sort of sense as to how much less that would be?","Dave Lesar","Clearly, less, how much less that kind of depends on the size of the job and where it is and some of those things. But again our whole strategy was around putting equipment that is basically the lowest total cost of ownership and the ability to handle bigger jobs with less back up. And we\u2019re seeing that happen that\u2019s why we\u2019re -- and we described the 20% better efficiency out of our equipment and we\u2019re consistently seeing that work that way.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Okay, a question for Mark on the guidance, so on the third quarter guidance you guided to kind of close to 20% margins in North America in the third quarter. Now if I recall correctly a lot of that\u2019s all coming from the cost side. Is there more to go on the cost side, you see margins picking up and should we start thinking and could we kind of start layering in I know you\u2019re kind of holding off and kind of say in the timing of pricing. But is that kind of next phase as you think about margin progression in North America?","Mark McCollum","Yes, I think in terms of cost it is. If we look back at sort of the margin progression in Q1 to Q2, there is a little bit of cost, some of that\u2019s cost of goods sold and then commodities as Angie highlighted earlier that we certainly were able to add some share. But when you look back I mean in our analysis it is very much activity driven. Our units out there are working harder and they are sort of a breakpoint that really adds to the margin. We just finished the roll out of the core components of our Battle Red program. It\u2019s now in the field fully deployed. We\u2019re working through the change management of that process now as that stabilizes for the next couple of months. There is going to be additional cost savings that will be added to it. We\u2019re going to continue to work on supply chain and logistics.","We all I think across the face of logistics bottlenecks and issues in the early part of Q2 with moving sand where it needed to be. We\u2019ll think as we continue to iron out logistics and add to our infrastructure there. We\u2019re going to be able to continue to drive additional savings. So at least -- we said all along we believe that we could get to close to 20% without the benefit of pricing and that is still the internal goal and we\u2019re driving hard to that and we think that the results of Q2 were a strong step toward that goal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now opened.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","Thanks and I guess I\u2019ll stay in the Western Hemisphere too. But first in Latin America, have you received the blanket order from Mexico for consulting and project management? I wasn\u2019t quite clear from the comment thus far.","Dave Lesar","So Brad the answer is yes. We did get the blanket order but we didn\u2019t get it in time to be able to book any revenues in Q2. And so now that we have the blanket order in hand the process now is submitting billings that ultimately need to be approved by PEMEX management that ultimately can translate into revenue. So I mean that really was the impact of Q2 that we had to book cost and no ability to book revenues offsetting that even on an unbilled basis. So that we\u2019ve got it now in hand and that\u2019s why we feel fairly confident in our second half guidance around Latin America with regard to that.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","Right assuming -- I guess assuming any kind of normal processing of those -- of your bills?","Dave Lesar","That\u2019s right, I mean it\u2019s clearly -- it's still customer dependent. We\u2019re subject to their timing and if they approve those bills on an expeditious manner then we get to book the revenues and have the margin uplift associated with it.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","Okay, make sense. And then if I can come back to the U.S. too I guess we\u2019re also bouncing around some different questions here, but have you experienced in your view do you think you\u2019ve experienced some taking away of work from somebody else because of your distribution capabilities has have others already struggled but getting in the sand in place or some other facet of logistics that do you think you\u2019ve already taken share because of constraints of others?","Dave Lesar","But we did it at all the time Brad this is -- we rely on our infrastructure we\u2019re very proud of the logistics capability that we have and we really put to work in the second quarter.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company","Fair enough. Alright, that\u2019s fine. Thank you very much. That makes sense, thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","","Thank you. Good morning. Back to Latin America Mark, high confidence level with regard to your Latin America second half guidance and you\u2019re rationale with regard to the endorsing of the software order makes sense. You also had a stake in however in the press release that \u201cwe believe our full year Latin American margin should improve sufficiently to be around the \u201913 assuming approval on the billings under the blanket order in Mexico as well as a swift resolution of a retender in the Brazil drilling contract\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound like given you commentary that in fact your Latin American targets for the second half of the year are all that contingent on a resolution or the retender, correct?","Dave Lesar","No, they are contingent on that as well the -- I mean both issues are there, the Mexico lack inability to build on the blanket order and of course the mobilization cost that we incurred where the larger issues of why the margins were off of Q1. So I think that relative to guidance that we gave at the end of Q1 the blanket order was the culprit that really hurt us in terms of being below what we thought the Latin American business was going to look like in Q2. So as we go to Q3 getting that back certainly helps us.","The Brazil retender obviously we\u2019re subject to our customers\u2019 calendar as well on that front, they have a fairly aggressive schedule and so for they\u2019ve been executing against that schedule, we\u2019re hopeful that we can get some relief under that contract expeditiously if for some reason they begin to delay that process that push retender out to the end of the year and again right now I can\u2019t see that but assuming that happened it could have a marginal impact on us later in the year, in the fourth quarter.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","But the vast majority of the margin bridge for the second half of the year is the combination of the blanket order in Mexico coupled with object inception in Mexico as well?","Dave Lesar","","That\u2019s exactly right.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","","Okay, great. And then secondly, this is probably a Dave question but maybe not, with regard to -- or Russia, you\u2019ve made some comments here there are some project tenders in the latter part of the year which now -- which could be delayed based upon the possibility of sanctions or just the turmoil that\u2019s underway in the region, could you elaborate on that and what that means? And then moreover if you could remind us kind of what percentage of your revenues are actually derived from Russia these days? Thank you.","Dave Lesar","","Yes, thanks Bill. The Russia business for us is the growing business and I think the commentary that you\u2019re describing is more around our outlook if sanctions were to be increased or become more so, currently at least till now the sanctions themselves have had a minimal impact on the business but as we -- as sanctions potentially escalate and the risk of more sanctions sort of looms that's what we believe puts some risk into the business in the back half of the year.","Mark McCollum","I think on your sizing question Bill, this is Mark, I don\u2019t want to give any kind of specifics but I think the Russian business is the low single-digits percentage of our total revenues, company revenues, low single-digits.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now opened.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering Holt","","Hi, good morning. You mentioned several numbers just around completion size and intensity in the both leading edge I believe ahead of what you\u2019re seeing year-to-date, what are the answers for the industry to just in terms of preparedness is that just greater local storage, and do you see infrastructure as a limit or in terms of the industry actually being able to transition completions to where they want to go over the next 12 months?","Dave Lesar","Yes, thanks. And we were seeing as you described record levels of congestion rather to speak for the industry itself I will speak for Halliburton and so where we spend our time is focused on building out that logistics capability to have access to adequate supplies of both propones and chemicals and there are many elements along that supply chain and we focus on each of them and we also maintain a broad base of suppliers on the sort of the source end of that business so I think the -- from our standpoint the volumes continue to increase, we really think it plays to what we would like to do which is prop into location and then just as importantly have the equipment on location that can handle it and deliver jobs very effectively.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering Holt","","And the follow-up question has -- it is just around any sort of inflationary pressure as you are seeing here in the U.S. anything at this point where you are not able to recover your cost inflation from the customers even if it\u2019s not matched perfectly in timing and you think that you are stuck with?","Dave Lesar","","Not at this point, we are able to -- so we have got great visibility into the inflationary pressures, we are -- and because of that I think we have the ability to respond to those quickly and get those in front of our customers.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering Holt","","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","","Good morning guys.","Dave Lesar","","Hi, Jim.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","I want to ask a pricing question because the anti-trust but I do want to drill down on something, investors don\u2019t want anybody in the industry adding capacity. If anybody adds capacity it slows down the pricing improvement so some people are going to see your acceleration of capacity adds as a negative. And I just want to ask I would assume that these capacity additions won\u2019t reduce margins it won\u2019t reduce your returns, is that a fair statement?","Dave Lesar","","That\u2019s a fair statement Jim, I mean we are building to contract and we are building to fair away customers I say fair away players. So, we have got a lot of confidence that our equipment it goes to work in the market.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","","Okay, okay I appreciate that that\u2019s going to probably be one of the hottest topics following the conference call is what that\u2019s going to be and I would assume that the 300 billion increase in CapEx would be to a large extent that acceleration of hydraulic horsepower?","Dave Lesar","","Yes, it is.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay, my follow-up if I could, Bill asked it and I will kind of chime in, in the end. The two areas that we are worried about going forward are Iraq and Russia but only if sanctions or violence continues it then reveres -- you guys only have about a $100 million in assets in Iraq how material could that be in the year or two if things get worst than better does that -- would that be enough to drive your earnings down in two years?","Dave Lesar","","Jim, as we look at that market I mean it\u2019s a bit of a unknown over two years time what that could mean what we are seeing happen today are delays and getting contract approvals through the government and the extensions of contract I have to believe that, that rights itself over a period as long as two years because of the importance of hydrocarbons in that markets and to the government et cetera. So, as we look further down the road I mean I can see where this comes right as things settle out if it were to continue to escalate, clearly we have got other places we could move equipment and put it to work even in that very region. So, I think we have got lots of options we just prefer not to exercise them.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Thanks for the clarification guys.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. So, back at the November Analyst Day kind of weighed out the North American target that at some point second half of the year margins would be approaching 20%, activity levels are better than expected at that point in time, the frac market is tighter, you are getting cost recovery, just what\u2019s the market dynamic that keeps from seeing margins above that 20% at that time the target that was weighed out at that time?","Dave Lesar","","As I hear a tough customer I think it\u2019s ultimately the dynamic largely the fact that there is inflation offsetting a lot of what we are doing to right here, you talked about activity, you talked about the increased -- the ability to pass through but we are constantly as Jeff has alluded to managing logistics challenges we are managing inflation across a number of cost categories and so that really is ultimately is pushing against us. We are continue to navigate through that very effectively and as I have indicated earlier, what we are seeing our largest margin improvement thus far has been on just the share efficiency of running our crudes really stretching out what we can do with these Q10 fleets and what our guys could do in the field every single day it\u2019s a differentiator for Halliburton that we see other people not being able to drag, we are going to continue to push on that until such time as I would say the pricing lock jam breaks.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And so, may be if I just summarized it, it\u2019s -- yes you are getting cost recovery which is not instantaneous relative to the cost inflation that you are seeing?","Dave Lesar","","Yes it never is.","Mark McCollum","","It never is.","","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. And then just a quick clarification the less than 10% excess capacity in horsepower is that before or after what I would call just normal industry friction?","Dave Lesar","","Not sure, what you define is friction Doug\u2026","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It\u2019s just crudes moving in the yard just something that -- there is always some amount of capacity that\u2019s not available even if it truly is in the market?","Dave Lesar","","Our view is that it probably has some view of that, right. The reason we believe that\u2019s fallen that low is impart sort of twofold. One is, crude sizes have to grow, seems like 20% to 50% in some cases as the equipments working harder, so you have got more equipment in the field per fleet. And the second issue is because it\u2019s working so much harder, there is more in the shop and in the base, being worked on at any one point of time. And so the net, what we are trying to do is get a percentage calculation of what\u2019s available to work and it appears to us that what\u2019s available to work now is less than 10%.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. My question relates to the share buyback program or the expansion that you announced. Mark, are you going to, I mean just to kind of sort of regular share buybacks on a monthly basis or this Dutch auction that you are considering as well as you have done in the past?","Mark McCollum","","Waqar, there is no limitation as to how we can spend the money that the Board has authorized us to spend, so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily preclude a Dutch auction. I think though that right now it doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s the appropriate way to approach the market. We just did one last year. It was debt finance, and so our debt ratio was high. What I am primarily focused on is thinking about how do we deploy access cash, either -- obviously we have an opportunity here for reinvestment in the business that we have been discussing in North America. We have an opportunity all the way for additional M&A transactions similar to what we accomplished in Q2. But to the extent that we are generating more cash flow than we thought we would and that certainly has been the case over the last couple of quarters. And we believe will continue to be the case over the next few quarters. You will see us be in the market doing ratable share purchases until such time as it makes sense, collective sense, financial sense to do something on a larger scale.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then on Brazil, so retendering certainly positive but when should we expect kind of activity to actually pick up. Is that something that could happen early in \u201915 or later in \u201915, what\u2019s your view on that?","Mark McCollum","","Waqar, we don\u2019t see a lot of change in \u201915, I mean this could be a \u201916 event when we see things, take back up there. There is opportunities for things to be done but I think there is also a lot of sorting out to be done.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Minervino of Susquehanna. Your line is now opened.","Chuck Minervino - Susquehanna Financial Group","","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back also to the Analyst Day comments as well and I was hoping you can may be update us on the context of the guidance I believe you gave at that Analyst Day around $6 number for 2016. I also believe they are really heavily dependent on the self help you could do and getting really contemplate this improvement in this North America cycle. So may be clarify for us if you can and then also kind of may be give us some update on how you are thinking, is it possible that that kind of $6 number, I know it could have gone higher, I remember that slide at your Analyst Day. Can we see that $6 kind of run rate sooner than that or that $6 number going higher in \u201916 as well may be an update there?","Dave Lesar","Chuck, 2016 seems like a long, long time away but I think it\u2019s fair to say six months or so off of our Analyst Day. We are very pleased with the progress that we are making on all fronts and each of our strategy is unconventional, deepwater mature fields. From a financial standpoint, the things that we are being able to accomplish in terms of improving cash flow, we are tracking right along the line, may be a little ahead of where we thought we will be in terms of reducing working capital. And so as I look at it, I think that everything is going exactly the way that we have planned may be a little bit better but don\u2019t necessarily want to get out there right now with the 2016 forecast. But certainly we firmly believe in our strategy both operational as well as financial strategy and we are going to execute against that strategy. We are not going to lever-off of that right now and feel like that certainly it\u2019s being successful in driving us forward.","Chuck Minervino - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay and then just a couple of quick ones. When you did lay that out, at that particular time did you anticipate having to add pressure pumping capacity or was that kind of planned with, when you laid that out, was that more of using what you had in the field?","Jeff Miller","We had always planned to implement the Q10 in fact of the future strategy, so the timing and the pace of that was not as clear certainly a bad time but given the value and the efficiency of the equipment, part of our strategy has always been to put that newer technology to work.","Chuck Minervino - Susquehanna Financial Group","","Alright, thank you very much.","","Operator","","Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing comment.","Kelly Youngblood","Thank you, Sam. On behalf of the Halliburton management team, I am sorry Dave\u2026","Dave Lesar","Yes Kelly let me just add one last comment to what Jeff said because I think it\u2019s been important one and that, and it goes back to the issue that the question Jim Wicklund had around our market expectations in adding pumping capacity. Of course we\u2019re not going to be crazy enough to add equipment into the market if we see that it\u2019s going to have an impact on our margin expectations from the direction that they\u2019re had it right now. We build to market expectations. We build to the customer base we have. We build to the market share we believe that is efficient to support our business in North America. And we\u2019re also building in a Q10 fleet that we believe is second to none in the marketplace.","So as Jeff said all we really are doing is accelerating a bill that we have previously laid out to everybody to get it done faster to take advantage of the efficiencies and the competitive advantage we have from it sooner rather than later. So, I wouldn\u2019t get too exercised about it in my view I think it\u2019s the smart business decision and clearly we wouldn\u2019t do it if we didn\u2019t think it was in the best interest of our shareholders.","Kelly Youngblood","And with that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your participation. And Sam I\u2019ll turn it back over to you to close the call.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Sir, you may begin. ","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President.","During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory review we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters.","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.","Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?","Dave Lesar","Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2015. First, total company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35% decline in both the average worldwide rig count and global drilling and completion spend.","And even though it was a very tough market, I am pleased to say that once again, we outpaced our peer group in North America and internationally both sequentially and on a full-year basis.","I am especially pleased with the resilience of our international business, despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest peers sequentially and on a full year basis in both revenue and in margins.","And in North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year where we saw unprecedented declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance.","From the 2014 peak, our completions-related activity declined approximately 33% relative to a 64% reduction in the US land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn and positions us well for the market's eventual recovery.","Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without reaching a settlement or the DoJ initiating litigation.","In December, the DoJ informed us that they do not believe that our previously announced proposed divestitures are sufficient to address the DoJ's concerns, but acknowledged that they would assess further proposals.","With respect to the European Commission, the review has entered phase 2, which was anticipated and we recently advised the commission that we plan to formally propose remedies which we believe should satisfy any competition concerns.","Earlier this month, Halliburton presented to the DoJ an enhanced set of proposed divestitures in order to seek their approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the enhanced divestiture package.","The sales process for the planned divestiture continues and we are in discussions with interested buyers. There is no agreement to date with the DoJ or EC as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures.","Our conversations with the DoJ and the EC and other enforcement authorities continue with the desire to resolve their competition-related concerns as soon as possible.","Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the extended time required to obtain regulatory approvals. Now while it is taking longer than originally expected, we believe the compelling strategic and financial benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination continues to remain intact.","We strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for our customers. The combination is expected to create an even stronger company and achieve substantial efficiencies, enabling us to compete aggressively to provide efficient, innovative and low-cost services.","Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers oil services needs and help them operate more cost effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state of the energy industry and oil and gas prices.","Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing the deal as early as possible.","In the event regulatory approvals have not been received by April 30, the merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement.","Now, let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and then Christian will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail.","Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that I've seen in my many, many years in business. We expect the market will continue to remain challenged in 2016 and that it will be the first time since the late '80s that global upstream spending will decline for two consecutive years.","Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing our customers to be cautious in providing visibility to us and their shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure plans. Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively influencing customer plans in the near term.","On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the most impacted in 2016. Third party surveys have also been a moving target, indicating a year-on-year decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50% and that's on top of the estimated 40% decline in industry spend in 2015.","But the reality is, due to the macro uncertainties, many of our customers are managing their businesses in real time, rig-by-rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this market week-by-week and in some cases crew-by-crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have confidence in a sustainable and economical oil price.","Now there are a number of moving parts in North America and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact timing of a recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be.","Until then, we will continue to execute our playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions, while also positioning our North America land business for future success and ultimately to outperform the industry as the market recovers.","The international markets held up much better than North America in 2015, but they are also not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third party surveys for international spend indicate a decline that may be up to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year.","We're working diligently with our customers to improve economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency, but do expect margins to be negatively impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout the year.","Now looking at our geographies, we expect activity in the Middle East, Asia region to again be the most resilient in 2016 as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Australia, India and other markets across Asia to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects.","Europe\/Africa\/CIS is also expected to experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016 with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea and Angola where the offshore markets continue to face extremely challenging economics.","Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and the adoption of new standards for production systems. But these are structural changes that will take time to fully implement.","And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region with the largest declines projected in Brazil and Mexico as a result of significant NOC budget constraints. Latin America is currently expected to have the largest percentage decline within our international markets.","So in summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slog through the mud, but I can tell you we'll do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will. We believe our customers will remain focused on cost per barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which bode very well for Halliburton.","Now it is very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has visibility of the trough the recovery will come into view and when it does, we expect the recovery will play out very similar to others where North America will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the international markets where the rebound will be more methodical.","Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?","Christian Garcia","Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million.","All regions experienced revenue declines during the quarter led by North America as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined by 5% and 10% respectively as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter.","Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year end equipment and software sales. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue declined by 5% with a similar decline in operating income of 6%.","Lower activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased activity in Kuwait and Oman.","Turning to Europe\/Africa\/CIS, we saw the fourth quarter revenue decline by 6% with a decrease in operating income of 18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset by higher activity in Angola and Algeria.","Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9% respectively driven by reduced activity throughout most of the region, partially offsetting this decline was improved activity levels in Mexico.","Moving to North America, revenue declined 13% with operating margins improving by approximately 160 basis points. Reduced activity throughout the US land was the primary driver of the revenue decline, especially in the pumping-related product lines.","The margin improvement was primarily due to a spike in year end completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter. Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost-reduction efforts and minimal weather disruptions during the quarter. Our margins continue to include an elevated cost structure in North America in anticipation of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition.","For 2015, our total company decrementals were about half of the previous cycle due to actions we've been taking to adjust our cost structure throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $192 million after tax consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As industry fundamentals continue to weaken, we will continue to make further structural adjustments and may incur additional charges in the first quarter.","Our corporate and other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter, excluding costs related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related costs and this will be the new run rate for 2016.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 19% includes a retroactive benefit from Congress's recent approval of the Federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. As we go forward in 2016, we are expecting the first quarter and full year effective tax rates to be approximately 24% to 25%.","Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2015 with a total CapEx spend of $2.2 billion. Our current guidance for 2016 capital expenditures is $1.6 billion.","This CapEx guidance includes the continued conversion of our fleet to Q10 pumps to support our service efficiency strategy, which is critical in this environment. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2016.","This is the first time in over a decade that our CapEx is lower than our expected DD&A expense, which demonstrates our commitment to live within our cash flows during this challenging period for the industry.","Turning to our operational outlook, the severity of the activity decline in the coming year continues to be unclear, but let me give you some comments for the first quarter. Our first quarter international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality that occurs in geographies such as the North Sea and Russia, exacerbated by the uncertainty around customer spending levels for the coming year.","Although difficult to predict at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a low double-digit percentage with margins similar to the first quarter of 2015 levels.","In Latin America, we anticipate revenues to decline sequentially by a mid-teens percentage with margins retreating to the upper single digits. In North America, we also have limited visibility, but estimate that first quarter revenues will decline with the US rig count, which is already down double digits against the fourth-quarter average. We currently anticipate margins to come in at around breakeven levels.","And finally, we enter 2016 on a solid financial position with strong liquidity, which will enable us to address the current market challenges and be well positioned for the industry's eventual recovery.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Christian and good morning, everyone. To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our front line people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market.","As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very challenging year due to poor commodity prices and shrinking customer budgets. We believe that as the coming cycle unfolds, we'll see a continuation of what began in 2015, customers seeking efficiency gains and discrete technology to help them bend the cost curve.","At lower commodity price levels, we believe the market will continue to evolve in this direction and customers will adopt products and services that help them produce wells with a lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent.","Now this plays directly into Halliburton's strengths, helping our customers become more efficient on location can maximize their production, all of which contribute to lowering their unit cost per barrel of oil.","So regardless of the commodity price, we're continuing to execute on our proven two pronged strategy in this downturn. The first part being to control what we can control in the short term and second is to look beyond the cycle to prepare for recovery.","And with respect to the short term, this means making the tactical changes necessary to right size the business to the market. We revisited our cost profile throughout 2015 and made significant changes to help mitigate the impact on our operating margins and we'll continue to do so.","It started with where we were. We systematically reviewed profitability at a granular, sub product line level. This resulted in the consolidation of facilities in more than 20 countries around the world and closing down operations in two countries.","And finally, current market conditions forced us to reduce global headcount by 25% in 2015, a necessary but very unfortunate reality.","The second part of our strategy is to look beyond the cycle and ensure the long-term health of the franchise. For example, aligning ourselves with the right customers, investing in technology and staying dead focused on superior execution.","In terms of customer portfolio, we work to align ourselves with customers that have stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage in the basins. In North America, our top 17 customers make up 50% of our revenue. When the downturn began, these customers were among the last to lay down rigs.","Today, we're collaborating with them on ways to lower their cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful, and when the recovery comes, we believe that these operators and therefore Halliburton will be best positioned for the upside.","In terms of technology, 2015 was a successful year, despite the downturn in activity, we saw an uptake of new technologies such as DecisionSpace and RockPerm helping customers maximize production and lower their cost per barrel of oil.","A recent addition to our custom chemistry portfolio is our MicroScout service. MicroScout is a hydraulic fracturing treatment designed to deliver proppant into far field micro fractures enhancing the productive life of new wells. Early trials have indicated more than a 20% uplift in production compared to offset wells.","Now technologies like MicroScout represent years of research through a disciplined, multistage, gate program and although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well.","Through joint reach projects with our customers and by elevating field developed solutions, Halliburton is among the more efficient innovators in any industry.","Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&D cost of less than $1 million per patent. In terms of R&D patent efficiency, which is central to the return on intellectual property, Halliburton is in the same range as other top global US patent leaders.","And finally, superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell you that in a market like this a timely efficient job can be the difference between an economic well and an uneconomic well.","So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by service quality or simply put, it's how we distinguish ourselves to win and retain the work.","Now looking at 2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year of improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit reductions from 2014.","Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we're improving our performance rates, essentially doing more with less and doing it better. We're refining our processes and systems, eliminating everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition.","You'll be hearing more about this throughout 2016 as this is not a one time event. It's the relentless focus on efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution company.","We believe that these elements, our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend and our superior service quality provide a strong foundation for our business. We are confident that by executing on our strategy and building on the successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and when the recovery comes.","Now let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?","Dave Lesar","Thanks, Jeff. Let me sum it up. As I said, 2016 is shaping up to be one tough slog through the mud and the industry is going to have to take it a quarter at a time. We have a seasoned management team and a proven playbook that has served us well during previous cycles and we're entering the year from a position of strength with a solid financial position.","We are focused on maintaining a strong customer portfolio, investing in more efficient technology and delivering reliable, best-in-class service quality for our customers and are preparing the business for growth when the industry recovers. And as we demonstrated this year whatever the market gives us we will take it and then take some more.","And finally, we remain fully committed to closing the pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. We are diligently focused on the regulatory reviews, the divestiture process and planning for integration activities after we close the deal.","So with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James West from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey, good morning, guys.","Dave Lesar","Morning, James.","James West","So Jeff, really impressed with the international operations in 2015, I mean, growing margins, outperforming on the revenue decline. Obviously, there's a lot of cost management going on there.","Could you maybe highlight a little bit further how you guys were able to outperform and what '16 looks like in terms of your ability to continue to outperform?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Well, thank you, James. It really is around aggressive cost control. And we've been outperforming for a number of quarters. This looks like winning the right contracts and managing the heck out of the costs most certainly and it's also a mature field strategy in action.","I mean, a big piece of this is mature fields and where we see the benefit of scope, scale and that clarity of strategy, it's a recipe for success. So really pleased with the performance and that team is right on top of their business.","James West","And you think that out performance could continue as we go through '16?","Jeff Miller","Yes. So if we look at '16, I mean, it will be a tougher slog in '16, no question. I mean, we're seeing fairly constant pressure around negotiation and tenders. But, in some cases, we are having what I would say positive collaborative discussions with clients around how to reduce uncertainty, increase system efficiency. So certainly pleased with our performance right now.","James West","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","Thanks. Good morning. Follow up question on some of the international commentary earlier, specifically Latin America. I think there was a sequential revenue decline somewhere in the mid-teens.","Christian or Dave, could you maybe give us a little bit of color, is that based on activity declines, is it pricing, both or do you have any other major projects that may be rolling off? Just maybe a little more commentary over what's driving Latin America at least in the first quarter?","Christian Garcia","So in Latin America, if you look at our sequential declines, it was 6%, down 6%. It was driven by almost all countries except for Mexico. Now on a product line by product line basis, we had actually good Landmark and Baroid. However, we also had some expenses associated with our vessels in Mexico.","Dave Lesar","Maybe one further comment. I mean, across the piece it's a tough slog in Latin America. Nearly every country is facing some sort of particular challenge, whether it's macroeconomic or just pure facing down commodity price, which is an example for a Colombia for example.","So we're seeing historical lows in terms of rig activity in a couple of countries and I don't see that changing.","Jud Bailey","Okay. I guess I was more referencing the first quarter, some of the commentary. I think - didn't you say, Christian, mid-teens sequential decline for revenue?","Christian Garcia","Yes, that is absolutely correct. And it's because of the macro headwinds that Latin America is facing. As Dave pointed out, Latin America will probably be the most challenged international region that we have and it's particularly acute in Mexico and Brazil.","Jud Bailey","Okay. All right. And my follow-up, Dave, maybe if you could maybe talk a little more about North America and I guess specifically the nature of discussions with customers and maybe how those are evolving with commodity prices to start the year. They are obviously going through a number of different budget initiatives.","Maybe you could talk a little bit about any visibility that you have or don't have and kind of what customers are communicating and how they are thinking about the first half of 2016 in North America?","Dave Lesar","Yes, I mean, I'm talking almost every day with the CEOs of our customers and I would say that it's a real challenge out there. And I guess the way I would sum it up is there is sort of a constant revision of budgets going on and those revisions are clearly with a downward bias.","So the way I would describe it is, right now, our customers don't know what they are going to spend, where they are going to spend it and when they are going to spend it in North America at this point in time, which is why I made the comment earlier we really are trying to run the business on literally a week-by-week, crew-by-crew, unit-by-unit basis until our customers see some stability in pricing where they can then put a stake in the ground.","But until they can put that stake in the ground, we're just going to have to remain very flexible and I like our chances in that kind of a market.","Jud Bailey","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, guys and certainly I echo James comments on a very impressive quarter and year given overall market conditions.","Dave Lesar","Thank you.","Christian Garcia","Thank you.","Angie Sedita","So a little bit of granularity on the US pressure pumping market. In the past, you've done some work on the potential level of attrition, specifically for pumps and engines versus fluid ends, so any color further on the attrition side?","And are you starting to see a change of behavior by the small pressure pumpers where they are starting to become more aggressive in either pulling out of the market or on the cost side or can they?","Jeff Miller","Angie, this is Jeff. Attrition is really the story here and consistent with remarks before, we see today about half the equipment is idled. That's equipment that's not being maintained and is being cannibalized for parts more broadly.","The service intensity, believe it or not, continues to creep up. So we saw a 9% sequential increase in profit pumped on a per well basis, which means equipment is working harder than it ever has.","We estimate 4 million to 6 million horsepower that will be out of the market by the second half of 2016. My gut says we're at the top end of that range right now. And this is really why we're committed to Frac of the Future. I mean, it's the cost of the pump and it's the total operating cost of the equipment that matters in my view the most and that's what will have Halliburton best positioned for the recovery.","Angie Sedita","Okay, very, very helpful. And then any change in behavior with the small guys given where their margins are and overall profitability or status quo with what you saw in the second half of '15?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean, we don't see ourselves as competing with that group, but they are certainly aggressive in the marketplace. We haven't seen them back off.","But, again, this is the reason why we have strategically invested in Frac of the Future and surface efficiency and then the custom chemistry that we deliver. I talked about some of that in my earlier comments, I mean, those are the things that differentiate Halliburton.","Angie Sedita","Okay. Perfect. And then as an unrelated follow-up, on the merger, obviously, you can't talk about the regulatory process, but, Dave and Mark, you've commented in the past that you've reiterated your confidence on the cost synergies with Baker cutting pretty aggressively as well on the cost side. Can you talk about the cost synergies, your confidence there into 2016, '17?","Dave Lesar","Angie, I don't want to elaborate anymore, but the cost synergy story stays intact.","Angie Sedita","Okay, perfect. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Dave Anderson","Great. Thank you. So you mentioned several mature field projects in the Middle East, I think, you said are poised to move ahead. How do you think the Baker Hughes transaction is having an impact on bidding of this type of work?","I guess I'm just kind of wondering, with the uncertainty around the divestitures it must make it a bit challenging for both you and your customers in terms of putting together and evaluating bids. Can you just talk a little bit about how this is being handled?","Dave Lesar","Yes. Dave, as you can appreciate, I don't think we want to go there.","Dave Anderson","Okay.","Dave Lesar","They still compete with us. We're still running our companies separately and they are in the market making their own pricing decisions and where they tender and how they tender and we don't have any visibility into that.","Dave Anderson","Okay. On a separate subject on North America, on your North American margins, I noticed the D&E margins in North America improved quite a bit this quarter. C&P was more or less as expected. I think you said in the release it was something to do with offshore. Can you expand a bit, obviously, it wasn't the completion sales.","Can you talk a little bit about what's going on? Is that a trend we should be expecting and maybe kind of your outlook on how you are seeing the Gulf of Mexico this year?","Christian Garcia","So on your question around D&E, D&E was also benefited from obviously aggressive cost reductions, as well as Baroid and Landmark had good quarters. In terms of just the overall completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we don't expect that to repeat in the first quarter.","Dave Anderson","Okay.","Jeff Miller","I think it's important, let me just follow that up because our D&E business is executing really well. I mean, those guys are dead focused on winning the right contracts. We're seeing the benefit of a lot of work in key markets for all of our D&E service lines.","Dave Anderson","Do you think you can keep those margins where they are over the next couple quarters in D&E?","Christian Garcia","Well, we're taking it one quarter at a time and we'll just have to see.","Dave Anderson","Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Thanks. Good morning. Dave, with regard to your cost structure, I mean, you extolled an exceedingly realistic outlook for 2016, international down as much as 20% and North America down anywhere from 30% to 50%.","And given the adjustments that you've made over the preceding two quarters, are you right sized for this expected level of activity in 2016 now?","Jeff Miller","Yes, Bill, this Jeff. I mean, we are always reducing costs and so as Dave described, it is a moving target. But there are still a number of areas where we continue to work on reducing costs, both at the variable cost, as well as around some of those sustainable fixed cost items like refining our maintenance processes takes out cost, value engineering exercises that are taking place. We, in one case took more than 20% of the cost out of 20 products.","So we're constantly, as I say, reviewing the structure. But I do believe these are things that best position Halliburton for the recovery.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And two housekeeping items for me to sort of end it, magnitude [ph] to Gulf of Mexico year end completion tool sales and then also depreciation, why is it going up when your capital spending is going down by as much as it is in 2016?","Christian Garcia","Well, it was because of additional CapEx, right. So obviously, there is a layering effect on the CapEx. On your first question, what was the first question again, Bill, on the completion?","Bill Herbert","Gulf of Mexico year-end sales, what was magnitude [ph]","Christian Garcia","We're not going to provide that sort of detail. As I pointed out in the prepared remarks, the margin increase in North America has been due to both the completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and also the impact of cost reductions that we did at the end of the third quarter.","To give you just a little bit of additional color, the sequential decrementals for the US land in the fourth quarter was in the very low single digits. So as you can see, there has been a significant contribution from the cost cuts that we did in the third quarter.","Bill Herbert","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Good morning.","Dave Lesar","Morning.","Christian Garcia","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","I want to circle back to the international margin risk as this is very top of mind for investors currently. Obviously, your margins have proven very resilient, so kudos to you and your team.","But this does lead some investors to believe that your clients abroad will simply continue to ask for larger and larger concessions until you're down to very thin margins. Can you just comment conceptually on why this risk is low to help allay these fears in the marketplace?","Jeff Miller","I think the investment internationally, at least by Halliburton, we were always sizing largely to the market that we saw. It's a little bit different than maybe what we saw in North America.","And so I think that our ability to pull levers internationally in key markets is probably more focused. The - and again, I think the ability to size as we move along will bode well for us.","Dave Lesar","Yes, I think, let me just add a little color to that. Of course the way you do business between international markets and the US market is also quite different. With the drilling and completion efficiencies that we've gotten in the US, the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced, which means the time between when you can price what does a frac cost or what does drilling cost or what does a mud job cost is very dynamic, very real time and it's very transactional.","The international market still continues to be a long-term contract market. So the discussions that you have with customers around price concessions and scope changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term contract, which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what you're delivering is adding value or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and therefore reduce their cost per BOE.","And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those things typically take a while to come to fruition. So I think really the velocity by which business is done in North America is quite faster than it does in the international market. And therefore, I think the margins will stay up at a higher level and not be compressed down to US levels.","Scott Gruber","That's good color. How should we think about the contract real risk then over the medium term, especially in light of these pricing concessions? So if I recall, the contract role risk was material last recovery period.","The starting point for pricing was obviously very high going into 2009. But just given the renegotiations that are ongoing today, does this minimize the contract role risk as we think about potential recovery in '17, '18?","Jeff Miller","I think the - this is an international question?","Scott Gruber","Yes, focused on international, yes.","Jeff Miller","Yes, and so one of the things that we typically see internationally obviously that cycle lags the US cycle. And again these are also economies, in many cases, that are built around production of oil and gas. And so from an activity perspective, they tend to be, on a relative basis, more resilient.","The second thing it does is it does provide the opportunity to better manage the work with some visibility, which helps us support margins and the second work with clients who are committed to a level of activity to then optimize that level of activity and that serves, I think, both our customers and us.","Scott Gruber","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Dan Boyd","Hi, thanks. Dave, can you update us on your mature field strategy, the opportunities you are seeing in this market? And then, sort of specifically, maybe tie that to Latin American margin projections going forward.","I was under the assumption that mature fields was becoming a bigger piece of the pie in Latin America. So I'm wondering if once you adjust cost to the lower level of activity, can we actually see margins trend higher after the first quarter?","Dave Lesar","Thanks. These are a good opportunity and we're seeing more of them. But I would say they are still on a relative basis a small part of our business. Market conditions are creating demand for these sorts of investments, but clearly they bring a different risk profile.","And so with that, they've got to have some key criteria like good rocks, good terms and service pull-through. And so when we look in a commodity price like the one today, these projects will be more challenged. And what happens in those is we'll slow down activity around those the same as any operator would.","Dan Boyd","Okay. And then unrelated follow up, but can you give us an update on the additional costs you're carrying in North America in preparation for the Baker acquisition?","Christian Garcia","The costs associated with the service delivery platform that we're keeping intact remains essentially the same in the last two quarters. It ran somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points and it remains at that level in the fourth quarter.","Dan Boyd","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey. Good morning.","Dave Lesar","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","I was curious on the CapEx front at $1.6 billion, how would we characterize say maintenance as a percentage of that?","Christian Garcia","We really don't look at it that way. Most of the maintenance expenditure is actually expensed and as such our CapEx is pretty much based on the line of sight contracts and also the implementation of our strategic initiatives like the Q10.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. And then you expect that $1.6 billion - I know there is a lot of change in the marketplace, clearly, but that $1.6 billion, you feel confident is based on existing contracts and not much movement on that going forward?","Christian Garcia","Yes, yes. Let me give you kind of an indication of how we run our capital program. Our capital program, as I said is based on line of sight contracts, as well as the implementation of strategic initiatives.","But as you know, we manufacture our own equipment. That gives us really a good ability to ramp down and ramp up depending on the market conditions that we're seeing.","So if you recall, in 2015, we began the year with guiding to flat CapEx to 2014 and ended up being down about 30% versus 2014. So that manufacturing capability has become a significant advantage here in this environment.","So the fact that we can ramp up and ramp down, we're going to adjust our CapEx program depending on the market conditions that we're seeing in 2016, and if we do so, we will communicate that to the street.","Kurt Hallead","All right, thanks. And then a follow-up would be you mentioned, Christian, North American decremental margins in low single digits during the fourth quarter. Do you feel you guys are at a point where the combination of your cost-reduction efforts.","And maybe good handle on where this market may be heading is that the decrementals you would continue to expect in North America as you move forward?","Christian Garcia","Well, we take it one quarter at a time, Kurt, if you think about Q1, if you look at our decrementals for the whole year in 2015, it was - for North America it was about 40%. And if you do the math implied by our guidance for Q1, the sequential decrementals would be less than that, which incorporates the lower activities from a continuing decline in the US rig count, as well as not having the completion tools repeat in the first quarter. So we're taking it one quarter at a time.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. That's great color. I do appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Hi, good morning.","Dave Lesar","Good morning.","Christian Garcia","Morning.","Sean Meakim","On your international margin performance, I was just trying to look at it a little bit differently. I'm curious how much of the mix shift between offshore and onshore and spend the last couple of years has helped your margins and how that could be a benefit going forward?","Jeff Miller","I think it's more of a shift between exploration and development may have a bigger impact than maybe onshore or offshore. Onshore is certainly an important and growing piece of our business in certain markets.","But when we get to not only drilling, but also completions of the development space is right in our wheelhouse and we've seen, as the markets have contracted, quite a move that direction.","Dave Lesar","If I can add to that, if you look at where Europe, Africa would have the most concentration of offshore is really the weakest. However, we also saw out performance in that region and the Middle East, Asia has the highest concentration of mature fields and we also outperformed in that region.","So both regions have been outperforming both on the onshore and offshore segments of our business.","Sean Meakim","Right. Those are fair points. Thank you. And then just back to North America. On Frac of the Future, do you guys have an update of where your Q10 mix stands today and what you think it would look like at the end of the year based on the new CapEx guide?","Christian Garcia","Right. At the end of the year, we had about 60% of our fleet is Q10, so actually that's higher than what we've guided during our Analyst Day. We said 50% by the end of 2016. We are at 60% right now and based on our capital plan, it should reach close to 75% by the end of 2016.","Sean Meakim","Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Dave, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the comment in the press release about the CGG collaboration? What is entailed in that agreement and where you think it goes?","Jeff Miller","Yes, this is Jeff. Look, we're excited about that arrangement and we think it's a great combination. A couple of points though, I think it demonstrates the value of DecisionSpace and its ability to adapt to and help in seismic interpretation.","It also, I think, the relationship advances our position there and our access to data to further develop fab software and serve a broader group of customers.","The other thing that it does from our perspective is it puts us in the seismic interpretation part of that business where we believe it is - where there is a lot of value, but then keeps us out of the seismic acquisition business.","Michael LaMotte","Is there any potential pull-through on other services you think once you are in the door at the interpretation level?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think that we'll work together. But I think the ability to advance the software and have bigger data sets to work with will always pull through, probably more in the software space than more traditional services. But clearly we believe this is a positive move by Landmark.","Michael LaMotte","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund","Good afternoon, guys. ","Dave Lesar","Good afternoon, Jim.","Jim Wicklund","How long will it take the industry to respond if oil prices one day were to go up and activity one day started to move up? How long would it take the industry to recover 15% of activity in terms of people, but industry overall?","Jeff Miller","Jim, this is Jeff. I'd love to have that conversation with you. I think that it would be a real mix of response and by that I mean the service industry broadly has been beaten up pretty good at what we believe are unsustainable prices.","But I think from our perspective, at least at Halliburton, I'm confident that we would respond quite quickly. If you recall, it was just 2014 when we hired more than 20,000 people onto the payroll at Halliburton.","And then the way we're taking care of our equipment now, I talked about the maintenance processes and the Q10 pumps, our ability to respond would be fairly quick.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. I appreciate that. And you talk about slower velocity in the international sector. We've seen guys like Chevron and obviously Pemex in Brazil cut CapEx. Usually they are done, like I said, more on a lower velocity level, more annual, longer-term contracts.","How soon US onshore can react immediately. How long will it take the NOCs and IOCs to start to pick up activity, will it take an annual turn?","Jeff Miller","Yes, again, you're right that that velocity is slower, but at the same time it doesn't slow down as quickly. So typically, we have seen that about a six-month lag behind the US internationally in terms of activity build, though it just tends to be more stable.","A lot of government approval is required and partner requirements to get that ramped up. But inside of existing projects, I would say within six months to a year that activity could pick back up.","Jim Wicklund","Six months to a year, okay. My unrelated follow up, how many lower tertiary completions do you expect to do this year versus how many did you do last year?","Jeff Miller","Look, again, a bit of a moving target, so I won't comment. If you think about it though as the lower tertiary is certainly a positive piece of our business. We love our position there with our ESTMZ and some of our other capability in the lower tertiary.","Jim Wicklund","Okay, gentlemen. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Mackenzie from Iberia Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Rob Mackenzie","Great. Thanks for fitting me in guys. My question, I guess it's for Christian on receivables. Can you give us a feel for how much of your receivables might be with E&P companies that are distressed or at risk of being distressed to get a feel for the risk we might see for capital accounts?","Christian Garcia","As Jeff pointed out in his prepared remarks, one of the key tenets of our strategy is customer alignment and based on that, the concentration of our customer in North America, 17 customers represent 50% of our revenues and those are the largest companies with better balance sheets that can withstand this downturn.","Now, as such, we don't have much exposure to the smaller guys, not to say that we're totally immune. But there is much, much lower than other service providers in the market today.","Rob Mackenzie","Okay. And my related follow-up I guess would be a similar question internationally, vis-\u00e0-vis, NOCs such as PDVSA, Pemex, et cetera?","Christian Garcia","Absolutely. There is no question they have been slow paying. In fact, if you look at their base working capital, that's gone up. Good to say that we lead in that metric and I think we've widened the gap against our peers.","But in terms of international, those are the largest companies in the world and we don't expect to have issues there as well.","Rob Mackenzie","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Okay, thank you, Danielle. So I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of key points. First, we continue to manage the near term, controlling costs, while managing to our clients' fluid capital spend outlooks.","Second, we remain committed to positioning Halliburton for the recovery, which means delivering efficient technology that lowers the cost per BOE for our clients, while aligning with those clients with stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage positions. I thank you. I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Danielle, you can close out the call.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Lance Loeffler, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Lance Loeffler","Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2016 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings.

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David Lesar ","Thank you, Lance and good morning to everyone. Our second quarter results showed great resilience in the face of a very challenging environment, which included declining rig activity and even more pricing headwinds. Our total company revenue declined only 9% sequentially compared to the 19% decline in the global rig count. Our North America revenue was down 15% from the prior quarter, significantly outperforming a 23% decline in the average US rig count. However, despite these continuing headwinds, based on the recent improvements to North American activity, I believe that this second quarter will mark the trough for our earnings. ","Now we're at a dynamic point in the cycle and I'm not going to waste the limited time we have with you on the call this morning discussing things like the macroeconomics, the worldwide demand, the general economy or commodity prices. There are many public sources out there where you can get this data, including our customers because that is the world that they live in every day. What I want to talk about today is the world that we know best. Now, conventional wisdom coming out of the first quarter was that the rig count would continue to drop. We said we saw North America differently and were the first to call a bottom for the rig count. This is precisely what happened. ","So let's talk about the reality of today's North America market. I can summarize this market in one sentence. Today our customers are thinking about growing their business again rather than being focused on survival. There are 2 distinct factors at work in North America; psychological and economic and I think it's critical to understand them both. Now, you haven't heard me talk about the psychology of North American producers before, but given what has happened to many of our customers in the last 18 months, I think it's an important point to understand.","I spent a large amount of time with customers late in the quarter taking their pulse and I can tell you there was a growing survivor mentality out there, and you can't underestimate the positive change in attitude that we're seeing in our North American customers. There is a spring in their step that I didn't see earlier in the year and in almost every case, they are talking about adding rigs, buying assets or doing something value accretive. In short they are getting back to business. ","The psychological factors are getting better. Oil reaching $50 per barrel, even for a brief time, was a critical emotional milestone for our customers as was being able to buy a strip above $50 per barrel. So maybe it can be summed up best by one customer who told me, Dave, it's actually a light at the end of the tunnel and not an incoming train. To borrow a Keynesian economic term, the animal spirits are back in North America, but also understanding the economic reality in North America is equally important. ","Pricing has helped cash flow but not enough. Hedges rolling off have created cash flow uncertainty. Balance sheet repair is still critical and many customers are looking at severe declines in production as many of them have drilled few wells in the last 18 months. And while there are many customers that have adequate liquidity, there is also a large segment evaluating how to access capital. This evaluation is around whether to do dilutive equity deals, accessing the high yield markets, looking at Reserve Base lending or partnering with private equity. But the important point is, they are back in business. Now our North America customer management teams are great to work with. They are creative, adaptive and increasingly confident and I believe they will find the solutions best tailored for their companies. This is also a smart group and they see today's looming supply shortfall and know that US unconventionals will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages. And you can be sure they want to reap some of that benefit. ","So let's talk about how the cycle is starting to stack up and how this coming up cycle will play out. Now obviously, the last 2 years has been a period of significant under investment, where global CapEx has been reduced by nearly $400 billion. As a result, the industry will have to find a lot of new barrels in the next 5 years. Now, you can choose your own energy supply expert and there are many of them out there, but most agree we will need between 18 and 22 million barrels per day of new production by 2021. Meaning we have to find nearly 2 Saudi Arabias worth of production in the next 5 years. To achieve this production goal, we believe there will need to be structural changes that have to happen. It clearly starts with a supportive commodity price and we're not there yet today. The prices will have to get there soon or the supply challenges will be even greater. ","Industry balance sheets will need to be repaired. The industry will need to replenish experience lost to retirement and cutbacks. We\u2019ll have to find sustainable ways to deepen the relationships between operators and service companies, collaborating to integrate better, eliminate duplication and drive down delivery cost. And finally, producers will have to accept the reality of service company economics. Some of the efficiency gains we have made with our customers are in fact sustainable and will continue, but others, including deep uneconomic pricing cuts, are unsustainable and will have to be reversed. ","In this environment, we are confident that North America will recover the fastest. The North America market has turned and we expect to see a continued modest uptick in the US rig count during the second half of the year and becoming more meaningful as we go into 2017. And now that we have seen the flow in activity levels, we expect revenue to increase based on higher utilization rates. And as we have said consistently, rig count stabilization is the first step on the road to margin repair, and Jeff will discuss that in a few minutes. ","Current service pricing in North America is unsustainable. We are in an environment where service providers are unable to meet their cost of capital and many are struggling to recover even their cash costs. Historically, as we reached the bottom, the downward momentum on pricing creates a headwind and margin repair tends to lag activity recovery by a quarter or so. To break this typical cycle, we have made structural changes to our delivery platform, eliminating management layers and consolidating roles and locations. As a result of these savings, we are confident that North America margins can begin to recover in the third quarter. ","When this downturn started, we said that we were entering it from a position of strength in all of our markets. Since that time, we have executed our downturn playbook and have continuously outperformed the market, both in North America as well as the Eastern Hemisphere, gaining market share in both. So to summarize, the market has played out as we predicted and our strategy is working. North America has turned and with our market share increase during the downturn, we believe we are the best positioned company. During the coming recovery, we plan to scale up our delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time, through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to a 19% percent decline in the worldwide rig count. Total company operating income declined 72%, primarily due to the continued decline in global activity in pricing, as well as the reintroduction of depreciation expense for our previously held for sale assets. ","Moving to our region results, North America revenue declined 15%, with margins moving down to an operating loss of 8%. The primary drivers were the impact of reduced pricing and activity in our stimulation, wireline and drilling product lines. ","In Latin America, revenue declined 12% and operating income declined 54%, as a result of reduced activity levels in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia and by our decision to curtail our activity in Venezuela. Rig activity in both Brazil and Mexico is at a 20 year low, while Venezuela continues to experience significant political and economic turmoil. ","Turning to Middle East Asia, revenue declined 3%, while operating income declined 22%. We saw increased activity in Kuwait and fairly consistent activity in Saudi Arabia. However, we also began to experience pricing pressure across the region and activity levels declined in Iraq, Australia and Indonesia. In Europe Africa CIS, second quarter revenue increased 2% and operating income increased 12%, as a result of the seasonal recovery of activity in the North Sea and Russia. ","Our corporate and other expense for the second quarter totaled $60 million and we expect third quarter expense to come in at similar levels. ","We recorded a tax benefit for the second quarter of approximately $6 million. Based upon our current outlook for the third quarter, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 50%. These unusual rate results from having tax losses in the US that are then offset by taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. ","During the second quarter, we had several special charges that we need to highlight. First, as we've previously disclosed, we recognize the $3.5 billion termination fee associated with the Baker Hughes transaction. We also recognize pretax restructuring and other charges of $423 million. These charges consist primarily of severance cost and asset impairments, as we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment. The largest single item in that charge was a fair market value adjustment, required by accounting rules for exchanging $200 million of our Venezuela receivable, for an interest bearing promissory note. This instrument provides a more defined schedule around the timing of payments, while generating a return while we await payment. ","There is an immediate expense because accounting rules require that these notes be revalued to their current trading value, even if you intend to hold them to maturity. Our current intent is to hold them to maturity and we expect to collect 100% of the principle. As such, the notes will accrete back to their par value as they mature over the next few years. All of these adjustments are tax deductible, but the tax benefit we recorded also includes the impact of removing our accounting assertion on permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings and some adjustments related to the carry-back of our now sizable US NOL. The NOL carry-back will provide us with a significant cash flow benefit later this year. ","Speaking of cash flow, this quarter was particularly noisy because of the termination of the Baker Hughes deal and continued restructuring work we are doing. When the smoke clears from the unusual items however, cash flow from operations was slightly positive and we closed the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents. Over our history, it's not unusual for our annual cash flow to be back end loaded in the year and 2016 is no exception. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows during this challenging environment and improving earnings and a number of working capital initiatives that we are implementing should get us alternately to breakeven for the year. ","Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million. ","Turning to our short term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the third quarter. In North America, the US land rig count is already up 5% sequentially on average and is expected to improve modestly over the remainder of the third quarter. We anticipate revenue will outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and that margins will improve by 100 to 200 basis points as a result of our cost control initiatives and better utilization. ","In Latin America, we are anticipating a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue with margins moving down to the low single digits. Although we may see some end of year sales, Latin America is expected to remain our most challenged region throughout the international down cycle and we do not expect to see a fundamental improvement this year. ","And finally, third quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue is expected to be down modestly low single digits due to declining activity and continued pricing headwinds. Looking ahead, we anticipate Eastern Hemisphere activity to decline over the balance of the year. However, we expect margins to remain flat in the third quarter as they also benefit from our cost control initiatives. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?","Jeffrey Miller","Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Let me start today with a headline. 900 is the new 2,000 for US rig activity. Now what I mean by that? I believe it\u2019ll the only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why? We know the North American market best and we're in every single part of that market. What's clear to us is that the increases in rig efficiency, lateral length and sand per well create a compounding effect that consumes increasingly more horsepower per rig. ","In addition, we watch the effect of the downturn on North America service capacity every day in every basin. We've seen the attrition of equipment, people and companies. Let me take these in order. First, horsepower attrition continues due to scrapping and cannibalization. We believe up to four million horsepower and maybe even more has been permanently removed from the market, representing about 20% of the horsepower capacity reported at the peak and more is permanently impaired each day. Industry headcount reductions continue and many of these people are leaving the industry. Finally, company bankruptcies and consolidations also work to accelerate equipment attrition. ","Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery. The steps are, must be present to win and we are. We are present in every market. Second is reduced directional cost. We're doing it. Third, increased utilization, we\u2019re positioned for it. And finally get pricing help. This happens when utilization increases. To be ready for the recovery, we played offense. First, we actively protected our market position with key customers, kept the majority of our fleet deployed and delivered fantastic service quality. ","Despite absorbing the pain of pricing reaching unsustainable levels, we made a strategic decision to stay in every market and keep crews running. In spite of the nearly 80% decline in rig count, our stage count only declined 33%. So here's what we're doing now. We preserved idle equipment outside of our field locations so it doesn't get cannibalized. It's clear to me that it will be cheaper to reactivate our cold stacked equipment than to put capital into cannibalized horsepower. This means we are best positioned to more quickly get back to work in the market recovery and are prepared to activate equipment when we see economic opportunities to do so. ","In terms of structural cost control, we're making significant progress towards reducing our annual cost structure by $1 billion. We've reduced headcount and consolidated facilities in every region. At the end of the second quarter, we're about halfway there, both internationally and in North America. We anticipate the remaining savings will come in the second half of the year and will reach the $1 billion run rate cost savings as we go into 2017. ","The next step is increased utilization. We know our platform is most effective when it's fully utilized. So job one is to fill the white space in the calendar. This is why we work with customers that best utilize our platform, in turn helping our customers produce at the lowest cost per BOE. Throughout the downturn, our superior delivery platform, which is our value proposition, our people, processes and equipment, results in a margin gap to nearly every competitor and we expect to maintain that advantage in the recovery. ","The last step will be the return of pricing. Price negotiations have been a bar room row. In certain situations, as we've seen signs of recovery, we've elected to walk away from money losing jobs in recent months. We've been reviewing every contracting and program down to individual wells on a pad by pad basis, including opportunities for pass-through and cost related pricing and surcharging. ","It's a tough market but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases. When we have these 4 things, we're confident our North America margins will return to double digits, but beyond North America land, our key focus areas are unconventional, mature fields and deep water and I'm pleased with how we're executing around the world. Though they may be limited, we're working closely with our customers to unlock unconventionals in every region around the world, including recent projects in Abu Dhabi and Argentina. ","In the Middle East we've made significant inroads in our IPM business, taking a market leading position during the downturn. This reflects the dedication our employees have for understanding their customer needs, identifying solutions, and helping to reduce risks, all while improving efficiency in this uncertain market. This creates a great environment for our collaborative and integrated business model, helping our customers to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil. ","Though we know deep water is the most challenged, we are collaborating closely with our customers who are working hard to drive down structural cost and make economic wells. BaraECD is an engineered drilling fluid system that allows us to manage narrow frac gradients while drilling. In addition to reducing overall growing times, BaraECD has helped break records on rate of penetration and is one of multiple systems that have allowed us to take a number one position in the Gulf of Mexico fluids market. ","In Southeast Asia we have a great example of a collaborative effort with a client that optimized the drilling solution, including drill bits and fluids for exploration well, reducing the drilling time by 14 days. This cost savings helped to deliver the lowest cost per BOE and is proof that when we work together with our customers and internally, we can provide efficient solutions in any market. The ability to input customer requirements into our drill bit development in short order, is what enables us to deliver this collaborative solution. ","Collaboration is central to everything we do. Not only do we say it, we do it. A great example is our new resource for customers and partners called iEnergy, available through Landmark. It's an open architecture approach to problem solving. iEnergy was conceived as a community of stakeholders sharing data and building applications. Think of it as our open architecture approach in contrast to proprietary and closed models in the market today. This is highly indicative of how we collaborate at Halliburton, not only collaborating internally, but collaborating more closely with our customers.","I could go on all day about specific products and services. Let me wrap up with what we do. Our competitive advantage is this. We collaborate, engineer solutions and execute to maximize our client's asset value, which means a lower cost and making more barrels. This is why we maintain our global service footprint. We will own the last mile, be present across the globe and maintain dead focus on service quality. ","To sum it up, we like our position. As we expected, the North American unconventional market has responded the fastest, demonstrated by the recent activity pick up. International markets will take more time to rebound, but we're certainly well positioned for when they do. I want to close by thanking our employees for maintaining their focus on service quality and executing at every level in this challenging market. Simply put, service quality is central to how we win and retain work. We've seen a record low incidence rates so far this year and it's important we keep this focus on safety and service quality as the market begins to pick up. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?","David Lesar ","Thank you, Jeff and let me sum things up. We are prepared for the North American upcycle. Our approach to the market remains unchanged. The North American market is turning. It will recovery the fastest and Halliburton will be the biggest beneficiary. In the next North America rig cycle, 900 is the new 2,000. The international markets will follow and we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to gain share. We are working hard at reducing structural costs. We expect to achieve a billion dollars lower run rate going in to 2017. We remain laser focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance, and providing industry leading shareholder returns. And finally, we expect that the second quarter will be the trough of our earnings and we are confident that Halliburton will be best position to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle. ","Now before we open it up for questions, I would like to thank Christian Garcia for his outstanding work over his 20 years at Halliburton, and particularly his work as interim CFO during the past 18 months. I very much wish him well in the future. ","Now, let's open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. ","Scott Gruber","Good morning. Jeff, as someone who spends an inordinate amount of time on headlines and titles, I really like your rig count headlines. It\u2019s a good one.","Jeffrey Miller","Than you. ","Scott Gruber","You stated that about four million horsepower has been removed from the North American frac fleet. Can you just provide some color on this figure? How much do you think has been disassembled, cut up and won't come back? How much is in more of a mothballed state? And overall where do you think these figures could stand by year end?","Jeffrey Miller","Let me go, maybe start with how we get to the 900 as the new 2,000 and then address your question along the way. So going into the downturn, equilibrium was about 2,000 rigs and 600 frac crews in the US. So a little more than 3 rigs kept every frac crew busy. Really 3 factors at play here. So first drilling efficiency and then completions, intensity and attrition. So from a drilling efficiency standpoint, rigs have gotten almost 30% faster meaning more wells per rig per year. So that new ratio is closer to 2 to 2.5 rigs for every crew. ","Second is around completions intensity and the jobs have gotten twice as big, meaning more horsepower per crew almost 20% more, meaning that the same horsepower that made up 600 crews now only make up 500. And so then we get to the attrition part of that and there are estimates that range from 3 to 7 million horsepower that have left the market. We think it's about 4. We see that because we're out in the market every day looking at horsepower. But the fact is there's more horsepower that it trips every day just given the type of intensity. So I think the important point is that you know the market can tighten maybe faster than you think. ","Scott Gruber","We certainly agree with that point. A quick follow up. We hear that some of the most dilapidated fleets that require 20 million, 25 million per fleet to reactivate are giving that really a full refurb on all the key components that\u2019s needed. Is there an argument to be made that pump technology has progressed to the point where it's just simply a better use of capital to build a new fleet than invest 20 million, 25 million to bring a legacy fleet back out?","Jeffrey Miller","Scott, certainly our view and that is the way why we kept our equipment the way we have, we segregated it with the end -- I described it is we stacked equipment with the end in mind so it doesn't take capital to do that. But I do believe that equipment that has not been maintained and has been cannibalized can be very difficult to get that economically back into the marketplace. ","Scott Gruber","Great. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI Group. You may begin.","James West","Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on a well-executed quarter. So Jeff, probably for you in terms of the North American land market and really just because of the devastation of the industry, particularly your competition, we see a lot of bottlenecks that are going to appear, labor, working capital, attrition like you discussed, the logistics. Could you maybe comment on what you see from the competitive landscape on where these bottlenecks, these pinch points might occur first or earliest and then how Halliburton can mitigate these issues relative to the competition that really can't do a lot?","Jeffrey Miller","Thank you James. Yeah, you nailed it. The pinch points will be equipment, sand and people. We spent time on equipment, but clearly the approach we've taken around equipment is to be best positioned to get that equipment back into the marketplace. So we\u2019ve talked about that. From a sand standpoint, it's not the sand as much as it is the logistics and in our view we're very well positioned around that, having built out our infrastructure over the last several years. We've got sand delivery in every basin and we've got sufficient rail infrastructure to address the logistics part of that. ","And then finally around people, we've been careful as we've gone through these restructurings to do our very best anyway to retain experienced people and we have those today. Then don't forget it was just in 2014, we put 21,000 people on to the payroll and so we know how to do that and we know how to make those people effective. So we feel like Halliburton is well positioned.","James West","Right. I totally agree. Do you think that some of the market share gains in North America have occurred because of your ability to ramp back up relative to the competition and your customer base, you understand these bottlenecks, these issues?","Jeffrey Miller","Yes I do. It\u2019s part of the flight to quality. As I described our value proposition, it's our process people and equipment and a big part of that is the reliability of Halliburton to stay and we have stayed in all of the key markets.","James West","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. ","Judson Bailey","Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I was hoping to get a little more color what your thoughts on thinking about North America over the back half of the year. Oil touched 50 as you noted. It\u2019s pulled back a little bit, closer to 45 or a little below now. How does that impact expectations in terms of activity increase the back half of the year? Is 45 enough and also is it sufficient to stabilize the pricing environment? It sounds like the pricing is still under pressure. So just like to get your thoughts on maybe the moving parts in the back half of the year as we think about oil in the mid-40s. ","A \u2013 Jeffrey Miller","Let me start that and then maybe follow up. We call it a landing point, which means rigs stop falling, but I think it's important that the \u2013 it\u2019s a sentiment that trumps the oil price right now. Based on conversations, they are clearly more positive and constructive than they have been in the past, but realize we were starting at the worst part of the market. A lot of the worst had been factored in the plan so moving up from what were clearly the worst plans. And I would call it a measured step up as opposed to a boom. And so certainly seeing positive things we think we will be well positioned for that whatever shape that recovery takes. ","Judson Bailey","Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks. My follow up is maybe from Mark. Mark, the margin guidance for North America up. I think you said 100, 200 basis point. That implies probably lower incremental margins than I would have thought given the cost cutting you guys are doing. Can you maybe talk a little more about the moving parts and thinking about how margins can move up in 3Q and then again in 4Q given the cost-cutting initiatives?","A \u2013 Mark McCollum","Clearly the cost -cutting initiatives are helping us, being able to get out there and address, but I think that the thing you've got key off of what Jeff was saying, that while the sentiment has changed, we\u2019re still in a very low activity environment. Our first course of action is to get utilization on the equipment that's out there in the field and depress that quite a bit. There are because you can see it in our numbers, there\u2019s equipment out there that's ultimately not covering fixed cost. And so we're working on trying to make sure that that equipment as we get it utilized is being as efficient as possible to move our margins up. ","I think that as we work through the restructuring, that's going to continue to add margin points here on everything. I guess what we're saying is, we're not counting on price at this point. The market itself, this utilization and what we're going after, we'll fight for price every single day, but it\u2019s still this hand to hand combat is just set out there and so we're not necessarily baking that into the forward look today. ","Judson Bailey","Okay, all right. Thanks guys. I'll turn it back. ","Operator","Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. ","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning guys. So Jeff, I also thought it was very interesting your comments there on the 900 rigs is the new 2,000. And so if you take that one step further, I guess you can conclude that that would imply in your mind that frac utilization will probably be near the last cycle peaks of 90% and then if you can take that another step forward, what would that imply on normalized margins this cycle and how you think the pricing will play out this cycle? Is it once we start to reach that 90% utilization or could we see pricing before then?","Jeffrey Miller","I think we see the state -- take the pricing first. That will follow utilization. So as we've described it in the past, we\u2019d expect to see utilization begin to tighten and at which point you start to see pass-throughs of things and opportunities to improve margins that aren\u2019t necessarily price. The real pricing leverage we actually didn't see in the last cycle. We were getting to that in late \u201914, just about the time things slowed down. So a lot of the value creation we're able to accomplish with our platform that\u2019s efficient and putting the utilization to it. I think the rest of that was the look forward around margin progression. ","Look, I would expect very able to accomplish what we did last time, except probably do better given the fact that we've done some of the heavy lifting around structural cost. So very encouraged about how things would look in the future. ","Angie Sedita","Okay, that's helpful. So you think margins could go back to where they were last cycle given the cost cutting at a 900 rig count?","Jeffrey Miller","Yes, certainly.","Angie Sedita","Very helpful. And then on the international side, can you, whatever color you do have, thoughts on when you think we could see the bottom in some of these regions. And also it was very impressive you saw some market share gains in your international markets. Maybe you could talk about that a little bit. ","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. So typically international business will trail US behavior by 6 to 9 months and it\u2019s historically done that. I don't expect that it's any different. So that means that it is still an absolute brawl in the Eastern Hemisphere. The things that mute that a little bit are the length of the contract terms, which causes it to respond more slowly. And then so from a, in my view margin resilience is really reflecting better visibility that we have because of the longer timeframe and our team, the Alberta team just absolutely executing on all points. ","Angie Sedita","And then on the market share again?","Mark McCollum","Angie, let me take that one because I think it's important to understand, the Eastern Hemisphere is sort of a tale of two customer groups. You've got the NOCs generally with mature fields and they're just trying to squeeze more out of their mature fields through their existing infrastructure and that part of the business actually has held up pretty well. There\u2019s certainly some pricing pressure there. There's certainly some issues with customers trying to lower their cost per BOE. I think it's the deep water complex that is the most challenged in this commodity price environment, and we clearly are working with our customers as are all the other contractors, to try to push that cost, that breakeven cost down in the deep water complex. ","But where pricing is today, it just doesn't work generally in the deep water, especially the new deep water. So we\u2019ve been focused on making sure that we get market share gains, even as the market has shrunk because in the long term, contracting nature of that market, when it does turn back up, you've got those contracts in hand and now market share becomes very sticky at that point in time.","Angie Sedita","Perfect. Appreciate the color and of course my best to Christian as he moves on. Thank you guys. ","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin.","Bill Herbert","Thanks. Good morning. Mark, back to the North American margin question. Just trying to understand it better. If you just focus on the quarterly rate of change and let\u2019s just presume, you made a prophecy I think with reason that your revenues would markedly outperform the recount in the third quarter. Just presuming a 10% increase in topline and only a 200 basis point improvement in margins, that implies a 15% incremental. At this stage, that just seems to be woefully anemic, recognizing the fact that you're unemployed from an asset employment standpoint. Is there a negative pricing role that's also being taken into account in the third quarter or would you characterize the guidance as conservative?","Mark McCollum","Bill, I actually am glad you asked that question because I was sitting here thinking there was another point that I didn't get a chance to make on the earlier comment. One of the things that we're already beginning to see in the marketplace is a little bit of cost inflation. Diesel, we're seeing it in some commodities and things. And so we're already, believe it or not, at this point beginning to fight inflation. During this period of time, it\u2019s off the bottom here with the slope of -- The shallow slope that we're on, it makes it challenging, right? We've got to get capacity utilization before you can really go get price and we're going to push, but some of the commodities are starting to poke their head up and it's catching us a little bit and that's part of what's being reflected in there. ","Bill Herbert","Okay and then Jeff, with regard to the evolution of your Q2 stage count, how would you characterize -- how did that evolve? I guess the specific question is whether the June exit rate stage count was markedly higher than the Q2 average. ","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. We saw it was higher in June, so the exit rates were higher than so the quarter average, which is reflective of a couple of things, which is modest amount of rig activity, but also we see ducts being worked off. And I wouldn't describe ducks as the bow wave, but they are in the mix and because we're in the market the way we are, we're a beneficiary of that. ","Bill Herbert","And how would you describe the frac calendar for the second half of the year? Is it disproportionately weighted towards Q3 and pretty solid and hopeful for Q4 or pretty evenly distributed? How would you characterize your frac calendar right now? ","Jeffrey Miller","We've always got better visibility sooner than we do further out, but I would describe it as more evenly weighted at this point in time then heavier to Q3.","Bill Herbert","Okay, thanks very much guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Sean Meakim","Hey, good morning. So just sticking on the frac business, Jeff talked about walking away from work in some cases and some of your peers have talked about requiring 20% to 30% higher pricing in order to justify reactivating frac crews. Just curious if you see it the same way. Thinking about your thoughts on what will it take for pricing to move higher and how much you need in order to bring equipment to the market? ","Jeffrey Miller","Sean, this is Jeff. Look, we're just not going to talk about pricing at this point in time. So we continue to look at every crew in terms of what's economic. And as we described before, we care a lot about customer alignment, basin alignment and customers that are able to consume our platform in a way that helps us and helps them. So we continue to view it that way. ","Sean Meakim","Okay, fair enough. And then Mark, you talked about, in previous discussions you talked about being opportunistic on some of the upcoming debt maturities. Maybe you pay down so much cash on hand, maybe in some cases you extend, so depending on what the market is giving you. Capital markets is fairly amenable today for those with even more challenged balance sheets. Just curious how you're thinking about debt reduction measures or the other potential changes to the capital structure over time.","Mark McCollum","I think our best opportunity right now is continue to look at maturities as they come due. We\u2019ve got a $600 million maturity coming up in the back half of the year. Our current intent right now is to make that payment out of our cash flow. We should have the ability to do that. That\u2019s a part of our cash flow forecast for the year. So that's the current intent. We're just going to continue to watch it. We\u2019ll just continue to watch it very carefully, but we\u2019ve got $3.1 billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet. It\u2019s a little more than we need. With some of these maturities coming, you'll notice that we've taken the tax hits to be able to move our money around as we need it no matter where it is in the world. So right now, our current plan is just continue to naturally delever. ","Sean Meakim","Understood. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Timna Tanners","Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color about some of your international comments, in particular wanted to take advantage of you being the first call since Brexit to see if you have any comments on your broader thinking about what that might imply for North Sea operations. ","Jeffrey Miller","Look, we don't see Brexit alone having a dramatic effect, though clearly like in so many economies around the world, oil and gas is a clear path to help an economy. So in some ways, I think that that would be structurally a positive in the UK sector or the North Sea but immediately, no impact. ","Timna Tanners","Okay, great. And then similarly, you talked about the 6 to 9 month lag in international operations, but more challenges in Latin America. What do you think we should watch for to think about what would trigger the recovery in that region? ","Jeffrey Miller","Latin America has terrific reserves. The bottom line is the reserves are there and we've been in some countries in Latin America for 80 years. So I think that the positive signs are going to be production. It\u2019s pleasing to see in Brazil for example, Petrobras is clearly back on the business pages today, talking about wells that are producing. But I think stability in commodity price is going to have to be one of the first things that helps in Latin America just given kind of financially where some of our customers are. But look, it is the kind of market that over time will clearly rebound.","Timna Tanners","But it\u2019s just going to be later because of the more reliance on oil prices or what makes it so much later, or what do you think is going to be that trigger like you said?","Jeffrey Miller","I think it's later partly because you've got to almost go country by country in terms of some of the disruption that's going on. And so Mexico is working through sort of a market reorganization along with some other things that have to settle out. I believe Brazil in terms of sort of the cost of Deepwater is always an overhang and how they work through that. And then the other big one being Venezuela. Clearly a lot of turmoil there too and it\u2019s very unfortunate, but hope to see resolution over time. ","Mark McCollum","Part of it is just the natural budgeting cycle for many of our NOC clients. Their annual budgets, they\u2019ll have to take their budgets and get it approved by legislative bodies. They're working off a year without significant -- they're not spending and they don't have a lot of cash flow and so that means that really until those budgets are approved, they're not going to be spending and oftentimes, that ends up happening sort of later, in the late first quarter or even into the second quarter before everything's approved. And so that starts to push out the ramp in spending. Even if they see higher prices, that pushes out the ramp in spending beyond what others might see. Whereas in North America, they\u2019re not relying on legislative bodies. They get out and they spend quickly as soon as they have the cash flow.","Timna Tanners","Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin. ","David Anderson","Thanks. Dave, you talked about the psychology of the E&P getting better. I was just curious, one big part of that has to be the lower breakeven cost that they're seeing. I\u2019ve been seeing a number of presentations from E&Ps who seem to think that the costs they have now are basically locked in place. Just curious how those discussions go. Are they expecting to see oil service inflation? Is this kind of how they're kind of locking in the next couple of years? I'm just kind of wondering what that part of the psychology of the cost side. ","David Lesar","Good question, Dave. I think the conversations go like this. Hey, we've finally driven service prices down to where we can breakeven, sort of a plus 40. My response to that is yeah, for right now, but you're not going to have any service industry to take care of you if you think that's where pricing is going to stay. And then you get into sort of a to and fro about what is sustainable. And you know Jeff hit on some of them. Rig efficiency is sustainable. That speed that we can drill out laterals is sustainable. The bigger jobs and higher production is sustainable. But that doesn't come without a cost. ","And so as I said, these are a great set of customers. They know in their heart of hearts that service prices have to go up. They're going to fight that impact of prices coming up as fast and as long as they can, but the reality is they know they need a viable service industry to be successful in the long run. So it'll be give and take and my guess is as we listen to the calls over the next few quarters is, the operators will say they've got them locked in and the service companies are going to say we've got to have price increases and we'll end up in the middle somewhere like we always do. ","David Anderson","Okay. So it\u2019s a bit of a disconnect now that kind of gets played out over the next year or 2, but there is an acknowledgement that the service cost do have to go up at some point though within -- do you think in the heart of hearts that they do acknowledge that there has to be some in there?","David Lesar","In their heart of hearts, they have to know that and I believe they do know that.","David Anderson","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC. You may begin. ","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good Morning. I just wanted to calibrate, see if you guys could calibrate some information for me. So you guys talk about a 4 million horsepower reduction in the US frac market. So that puts maybe the market at about 14 million horsepower give or take. We\u2019ve heard depending on who you want to talk to, maybe about 6 million of that horsepower is currently active in the market. That 6 million horsepower you guys talked about, a lot of whitespace, that 6 million horsepower maybe working 50% of the time. Does that kind of jibe with how you see the market right now or could you help me understand it a little bit better if you think some of those numbers are off? ","Jeffrey Miller","No man, I don\u2019t think those numbers are inconsistent with how we view the market and that's why we described the path back is it starts with utilization of what's there. I think there are barriers to a lot of that equipment ever makes it back into the market and I do think that unintended equipment almost retreats on its own, particularly with cannibalization that we hear others talking about it. So I don't think you're wrong. ","Kurt Hallead","So then in the context as we try to think about the opportunity for margin improvement vis-\u00e0-vis pricing, do we need to get back up to 8 million horsepower now being active in the market give or take or is it sufficient to get that 6 million horsepower we all agree generally on those numbers? Can we get that 6 million horsepower up to 80% utilization and is that sufficient, just to drive some pricing? Any viewpoints on that?","David Lesar","Yeah, I think -- Let me take that one because I think -- again, we're not going to go down any pricing path today. We have a pricing strategy that we're going to follow. We're not going to share it with anybody. It\u2019ll be sort of a discussion customer by customer, but I would say one thing is necessary. Don't fall into the trap is not all pumping equipment is the same. There are pumping companies out there that have zero utilization today because they can't find a customer or they\u2019re in the wrong basin or their equipment is not qualified to basically set a pump to formation where they are. ","So I think that there is a bifurcation, trifurcation, whatever you want to call it, amongst the pressure pumping companies. And I think a lot of people like to lump everybody together and sort of talk about averages. But I really think it's important to sort of segregate the market into the various basins, the various customers that are drilling, the types of formations that are being drilled, the kinds of completions that are getting done, before you start to get a more granular view of sort of what is really going on out there. And I think that's a view we have and I think there's a strategic advantage that we have. But I think it's important to sort of stay away from averages because I think you can actually draw the wrong conclusions about sort of the health of the industry. ","Kurt Hallead","All right, that's great color. And my follow up is on the international front. What region do you think will lead the way out and what product lines you think if frac is where you're very well positioned in the US among others to lead. Where do you think internationally Halliburton is best positioned to lead on the way out internationally? ","David Lesar","Look, I think the Middle East has demonstrated the most resilience and I think that when we think about our business, we tend to think more mature fields, unconventionals, and Deepwater. And so from a mature field standpoint, setting aside the Middle East, I think Asia probably has sort of the next chunk of runway and we're very well positioned there I'd say in all of our service lines. ","Kurt Hallead","Okay, thanks. Appreciate all that color. ","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","James Wicklund","I think that's great that you guys saved the best for last. I appreciate it. Mark, welcome back to the conference call.","Mark McCollum","Glad to be back.","James Wicklund","We look at the results and you give guidance in Q3 that margins will improve. The whole industry has had trouble keeping up with the decline in activity and now that we're starting to stabilize that gives you guys an opportunity to catch up. At what quarter, Q4, Q1 next year, at what point should we expect you to get to breakeven in North America?","Mark McCollum","I think right now just as we triangulate, Q1 of next year. I think that's where it will be.","James Wicklund","Okay. That\u2019s great, but the way incrementals work, we never can -- We're stuck with guessing. The second thing, playing golf the other day with a couple of guys in the forgings business, which is kind of leading edge, I got a report that the largest frac pump forging order in 12 months has been issued and I'm not assuming it\u2019s you guys, because you guys do a lot of your, most all your own work. But are we to the point in terms of sentiment and you mentioned optimism by your customers and clearly you're optimistic. Have we gotten to the point that service companies are now willing to look at increasing CapEx in anticipation of \u201917? And then that really applies more to your state of mind for the future. You guys state that the recover this year will be anemic, but it will get better next year. Are we starting to free up that sentiment in terms of capital from the service side?","Jeffrey Miller","Jim, it\u2019s interesting. Forging actually indicate more to me that they are trying to replace cannibalized parts in a lot of ways. Forging tend to be consumables as they repair equipment. One could interpret that as we've run out of cannibalized equipment and now are having to replace things. I don't see that as maybe the change in sentiment that maybe you do. But anyway \u2026","James Wicklund","I\u2019ll take restocking consumables. I\u2019ll take that as the first step. ","Jeffrey Miller","Okay. Step one. ","James Wicklund","Okay guys, I appreciate it. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. ","Jeffrey Miller","Okay, thank you, Shannon. I\u2019d like wrap up this call with just a few key takeaways. First, we like our position. We've maintained our global integrated service footprint, outperformed during the downturn and taken share. Second, for North America the landing point is now behind us and our customers are talking about growth, not survival. And finally, we\u2019re the best position for the recovery. We will on the last mile continue to address our cost structure and collaborate with our customers to maximize their asset value. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Shannon, you can close out the call. ","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

Overall, we had a fantastic quarter and I\u2019m very pleased with our results. We are hitting on all cylinders just like we said we would and this quarter\u2019s performance is another example of why Halliburton is the execution company. Here are few highlights from the third quarter.","Total company revenue was $5.4 billion, representing a 10% increase compared to our second quarter results, and we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow. Once again, we outgrew our peers on a global basis showing that we are taking global market share. Our North American revenue increased by 14%, significantly outpacing the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 6%. Total operating income increased 55% to over $630 million, primarily driven by continued strengthening of market conditions in North America and improved profitability in our drilling and evaluation product lines. Our completion and production division revenue increased 13% with 215 basis points of margin expansion, despite the approximately 50 basis-point negative impact of Hurricane Harvey. The drilling and evaluation division revenue increased 4% while operating margins expanded by 260 basis points to approximately 9%, demonstrating solid execution in our international franchise.","Finally, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Summit ESP, which is an important strategic step in building out our production oriented business lines and makes us the number two ESP provider in North America.","In August, the Texas Gulf Coast was severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey and our fantastic employees worked closely together to support those in our organization and the entire community affected by the storm. As a result of the weather, we had a few customers temporarily suspend activity in both the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford. We also experienced increased costs because diesel fuel was temporarily unavailable and reduced deficiency due to sand supply chain disruptions, both of which negatively affected our margins for the quarter. In spite of these disruptions, the sophistication and hard work of our supply chain organization allowed us to quickly adapt to these challenges and continue to execute and deliver superior service quality.","Let me take a moment and talk about a few things we said about North America in the second quarter call. We told you the rig count growth would plateau, and that\u2019s exactly what it did. We said our North America sequential revenue would significantly outperform average U.S. land rig count growth, and it did. We told you that our completion and production margins would continue to expand, and they did. We said operators were beginning to optimize as opposed to maximize the use of sand and turn to technology to increase production; this trend held true as we saw average sand per well remain flat sequentially. And finally, we said we would have the highest returns in the industry, and we do as we continue to outgrow our peers and take market share.","Now, let me spend some more time on each of these topics. During the quarter, the U.S. land rig count effectively flattened as customers reacted to shareholder input and their own view of market conditions for the balance of the year. However, our revenue increased and we saw improved activity in our completions related product lines due to the natural lag between drilling and completing wells. Today, the industry is drilling approximately the same footage as in 2014 with half the rigs while completions intensity has significantly increased. As the rig count stabilizes, our customers are focused on efficiencies, optimization and making more barrels. These are all things Halliburton does really well, differentiating us from our peers.","And I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made this quarter towards normalized margins in North America. Our strategy is working. And as I said in the past, the path to normalized margins begins with customer urgency, and I still see that urgency today.","We have three levers to achieve our margin goals. And they\u2019re, one, increasing pricing; two, improving equipment utilization; and three, structurally reducing our costs. Increasing pricing is important, but it\u2019s just one component we can leverage to reach our goal. Ultimately, we will utilize a combination of all three levers to return to normalized margins. All three levers are important, and the great thing about Halliburton\u2019s scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull on them all in a meaningful way. And you know Halliburton is the execution company. We\u2019re going to pull these levers as necessary to get to our normalized margins.","The North America completions market remains tight and we continue to push pricing across our portfolio every day. Demand for our completions equipment and service quality remains strong. The improving oil price outlook provides runway for us to increase our portfolio pricing as we go forward. So, let me be clear; we still have the ability to push price.","Equipment utilization comes in a couple of forms. First, it has to be working; and second, it has to be working for the right customers. Our fleet is sold out for the remainder of the year and into 2018. We continue to place our equipment with those customers who know how to effectively and efficiently use us to increase their productivity, which improves our utilization.","As for reducing costs, we continue to remove unnecessary costs from our company. It\u2019s also critical that we save costs and increase utilization through the use of technology. Our wellhead ExpressKinect unit is a perfect example. This equipment allows us to increase our utilization by switching wellheads faster and more safely when doing zipper-frac operations. As a result, we\u2019re able to reduce the number of people on location and improve our equipment efficiency.","Let\u2019s now take a minute and talk about a few topics that I hear frequently debated in the market. The first is sand. During the third quarter, total sand volume for Halliburton continued to increase, but our average sand per well remained sequentially flat. Data points from the last two quarters and my discussions with customers indicate customers are focused on cost-effective production. They hear a lot of conflicting anecdotes about sand used today, because they are based on individual operators and individual basis. But the facts are, for Halliburton, sand per well was down in the Bakken, Rockies and Northeast, and it was up in the Permian Basin. This happened because customers that know the production characteristics of the reservoirs have streamlined their operations to focus on cost per barrel of oil equivalent and are optimizing sand utilization. Conversely, those customers that are still drilling the whole acreage or exploring production boundaries at their reservoirs are continuing the pump jobs with higher sand loads. At the end of the day, Halliburton benefits from both scenarios.","The second topic is supply and demand for pressure pumping equipment. Now, first, let me be clear. I believe the market is undersupplied today. At the same time, equipment is being used harder and maintenance costs are higher. As a result, there will be a greater call for new equipment, just to replace the active equipment that\u2019s being worn out more quickly, meaning the day when supply and demand come into balance is further out than people think.","Now, I believe companies that are not making money will struggle to build new equipment beyond their current fleet, take or pay commitments, as they work with constraint budgets and struggle to find capital to fund further purchases. You see many announcements of new fleet deployments, but no announcement of fleet retirements. But, I can tell you, they are happening.","Next, completions intensity is not slowing down. We are pumping more sand with less equipment, and as a result, the maintenance costs associated with today\u2019s completion designs are increasing. The design of our equipment gives us an advantage over the market that even we have seen an increase in maintenance costs. I believe deferred maintenance is happening throughout the industry. A proxy for deferred maintenance and the simplest place to see it is in the industry and horsepower creeping crew size. Now, while Halliburton continues to operate with an average fleet size 36,000 horsepower per crew and have for the last several years, the rest of the industry is now averaging closer to 45,000 horsepower per crew. Deferred maintenance is creating this equipment redundancy on location.","The bottom line is that Halliburton has the advantage to respond to customer demand by bringing less equipment to the well side and designing our equipment to require less maintenance cost. Building our equipment internally gives us the ability to respond quickly to market changes and to design our equipment to reduce the total cost of ownership.","As a follow-up to that point, I said last quarter, I\u2019d be crazy to talk about new build equipment in detail terms, and this remains the case. But, what I said has not changed. We are first and foremost a returns focused organization. And we will only bring out new build equipment under certain conditions. And those conditions are, one, backed by customer commitment; two, captures leading-edge pricing, which is accretive to our margins; and finally, three, it generates acceptable return on investment.","Turning to the international markets. Outside North America, our more conservative outlook for the last several quarters is proving accurate. Our customers around the world have different breakeven thresholds and production requirements that all face the headwinds of the current commodity price environment. Due to lower cash flow and project economics, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs. The result of this combination is less activity and more pricing pressure.","In contrast to North America, where we believe that a $50 oil price drives significant activity, customers tell me, the longer duration international markets will react less to absolute oil price but more to a positive view of where price will be for several years. This isn\u2019t surprising, given the longer investment cycle that many of our customers face. I believe that we found a floor in the international rig count earlier this year.","However, due to the longer term contractual nature of international markets and the level of continuing price pressure, I expect discounts will offset activity gains over the near-term. In this environment, we have to execute and maintain margin by controlling costs. Our international organization is committed to making the toughest of markets sustainable and has continued to rightsize the business during the quarter, demonstrating impressive control over their costs.","In addition, customers embrace the way we go to market. We collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and it is paying off. In the eastern hemisphere, we achieved a modest improvement in activity in the third quarter but the landscape remains challenged. Pricing pressure and cost cutting remained major themes, and the use of technology to lower the cost per BOE is ever more important.","Our products service lines continue to deliver technology that drives our value proposition, maximizing asset value. The Middle East remains our most active international market with the largest part of the work focused on mature fields. Among many important technologies deployed in the region, I\u2019d like to highlight our CoreVault system. This system effectively stores sidewall cores with up to 2.5 times more oil and gas than previously. This additional reservoir characterization and effective means for doing so allow our customers to make more barrels and reduce cost.","In the Middle East, we continue to build on our leading position in project management because of our ability to work closely with our customers and deliver superior service quality. Our most recent contract win is a project to deliver over 300 wells in Oman, and we\u2019ve seen increased project management activity in this region, allowing us to showcase our services and technologies that reduce time and cost on a project. We have seen significant market share growth as we have a proven execution track record and deliver better wells for our customers.","In the North Sea, this year has been about reducing production costs through standardization and technology optimization. We have the technology portfolio to solve our customers\u2019 problems from single density, variable slurry cement that can be used for all sections of well to our data sphere array monitoring system that due to its modular design provides customized reservoir monitoring. We help structurally reduce cost by decreasing the time to drill and complete a well or by producing more barrels. What\u2019s most important to point out is how we collaborate with customers and together we create terrific results. Another example is in the North Sea where our ruthless focus on service quality, collaboration with the operator and rig contractor, driving efficiency on critical path items and responding to customer insight has laid to record-breaking performance on a multi-well integrated services contract. This project is truly a collaborative effort and through the collective thought and execution of the team, they\u2019ve been able to reduce the time to finish a full year scope of work by over 165 days, saving over $170 million. The improved efficiency came from two areas, technique solutions for record growing performance and collaboration where our commercially aligned team coordinated collaborative planning and execution.","Latin America saw a slight rig count growth in the third quarter, driven by increased activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. While activity is improving, the pricing pressures across the region make it increasingly important to be efficient as we execute. This quarter in Mexico, we designed and ran especially drill bit to help tackle a particularly difficult reservoir. This design reduced the necessary runs in hole, resulting in a three-day reduction in rig time. This example shows that even in a tough pricing environment, there is an appetite for new technology, especially if there were reduced costs.","Finally, in recent days, commodity prices have experienced the modest rebound, as we have seen some signs of tightening in the macro supply demand picture. However, I still believe that the oil and gas industry will largely remain in a range-bound commodity price environment in the near to medium term. I am confident that Halliburton has the right strategy. In this environment, we\u2019re focused on returns and capital discipline. In this type of sustaining market, I expect that our capital spending should be approximately aligned with our depreciation expense. Our working capital should continue to improve over time as our day sales outstanding declines to traditional levels and our free cash flow conversion should be in line with or exceed our peers, and to deliver these metrics, we\u2019re focused on maximizing asset utilization, improving working capital velocity, and capital discipline. When I take all of those together, I am confident that we will generate solid free cash flow in today\u2019s market environment.","Pure and simple, Halliburton is proud to be a service company, and we believe our investors and customers appreciate that. I am confident that we\u2019re working on the right things that create the most value and generate the highest returns. Our strong competitive position is not only a function of geographic footprint, it\u2019s also the depths of the products and services that we provide to our customers and use it to generate industry-leading returns for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update.","Chris Weber","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with the summary of our third quarter results compared sequentially to our second quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 10% while operating income was $634 million, an increase of 55%. These results were primarily driven by increased activity and pricing in North America.","Turning to our division results. In our completion and production division, third quarter revenue increased by 13% while operating income increased 32%, primarily resulting from improved activity in pricing throughout North America land in our pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines. On the international side, increased completions activity in the Middle East and the start of new contracts in Brazil improved results.","In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by 4% and 44%, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased drilling activity in the Middle East, North America and Latin America. Globally, we saw sequential improvement in all of our drilling and evaluation product lines.","Let\u2019s take a minute to review our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 14% sequentially, driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector in the majority of our products service lines, primarily pressure pumping as well as higher well completion and pressure pumping activity in Canada. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 4%, primarily driven by increased activity in Argentina, production group activity in Brazil, and increased drilling activity in Mexico. These results were partially offset by reduced well completion activity in Venezuela.","Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, revenue increased 6%, primarily due to improved utilization in the majority of our product service lines in the North Sea and improved drilling and well completion services in Russia and Nigeria. The results were partially offset by reduced activity in Angola. For Middle East\/Asia, revenue increased 3%, primarily as a result of increased activity in the Middle East and project management activity in Indonesia, partially offset by reduced activity in pricing across Southeast Asia and lower project management activity in Iraq.","Our corporate and other expense totaled $71 million in the third quarter and we expect our fourth quarter will be comparable to this quarter. As a function of our reduced debt balance, we reported $115 million in net interest expense for the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense for the fourth quarter to remain at a similar level. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 27%, slightly lower than expected due to variability in our earnings mix. For the fourth quarter, we expect the effective tax rate to range between 27% and 29%. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was approximately $1.1 billion.","Providing some color on our near-term operational outlook. As is typical for the fourth quarter, a combination of weather, holidays, budget constraints and year-end sales make forecasting a challenge, but this is how we see it playing out right now. Similar to prior years, we expect our U.S. land results to moderate in the fourth quarter due to the holidays and lower efficiency levels experienced in the winter months, particularly across the Rockies and Northern U.S.","In our international business, we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year-end product and software sales will be lower this year versus traditional levels as customer budgets are largely exhausted. Given these factors, in our drilling and evaluation division, we expect North America revenue will change in line with the average U.S. land rig count while international revenue will increase by low-single digits. For our completion and production division, we expect that our North America revenue will outperform the average change in U.S. land rig count by several hundred basis points while international revenue will increase by low single digits. We expect the operating profitability for both of our divisions to increase marginally in the fourth quarter.","Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Chris. In closing, there are few things I want to highlight. First, I am very pleased with our third quarter results. I want to thank each of our employees for their hardworking commitment to execute at every turn and deliver Halliburton\u2019s value preposition. These results clearly demonstrate the strength of our franchise and our ability to adapt to any environment.","Second, Halliburton\u2019s relative performance in the 2018 will remain strong, as a result of our ability to grow our North America revenue and margins, and improve our position in our international businesses.","Finally, our strategy is working and we intend to stay the course. We are focused on delivering superior execution for our customers and achieving industry-leading returns and cash flow conversion for our shareholders.","Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin.","James West","Hey, good morning, guys.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, James. ","James West","Jeff, for the first time, I think I can remember that your earnings met or if you exclude some of the Harvey impact, they Schlumberger\u2019s, which is pretty impressive I think. What part of your strategy would you attribute that to?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, James. Look, our strategy is pretty simple and very executable, and it\u2019s to be the best service company. And that means we focused on leading returns, margins and revenue growth, and along with that technology, directly focused on returns, collaborating with our customers, the strong BD group, and then delivering service quality. I think that returns focused, I mean that is our strategy and is working.","James West","Got it. And then a follow-up from me to a comment that you made towards the end of your prepared statements. It sounds like spending within or spending the levels, CapEx hitting level that depreciation would be really just sustaining CapEx, so little kind of growth in PP -- or no growth in PP&E. Can you perhaps discuss the discipline here on your side with respect to adding equipment to the market?","Jeff Miller","Look, I -- when we look at the market as it\u2019s playing out, I think we have what we need to execute. And as I described, what we see in front of us in terms of activity as I described international, described North America, I think at that sort of pace, then we ought to have a business that returns solid cash flow from that kind of market. And so, when I\u2019ve described those types of parameters it\u2019s to describe what we see. And you know again, focused on returns means that we are very efficient and we drive a lot of velocity with the equipment that we have, utilization, things of that nature, spend a lot of time talking about that. But that is in fact how we see generating a lot of cash flow.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.","David Anderson","Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Staying on the pressure pumping side just for a second here, your strategy in downturn is to gain share and stimulation. You talked about all your equipment deployed. So, I guess, I\u2019m wondering right now, does pricing out there currently support new build economics? It seems like we\u2019re in another one of those crossroads between maximizing returns or continuing to protect share. Can you discuss your thinking, please?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think we\u2019re always going to be about returns. Clearly, we need share to drive the volume and the scale, and that\u2019s where the efficiency and some of the things that I talk about are more meaningful at scale. But, specific to the building question, I\u2019m just going to go back to what I said on this, answered this a couple of quarters now, but the three conditions being to meet client, leading edge pricing and generating adequate returns. But I don\u2019t think that -- there is a lot of juice in utilization, there is a lot of juice and in effect market share comes from better utilization. So, I think you kind of under estimate the number of levers that we have in the market when it comes down to something that binary.","David Anderson","Thanks, Jeff. Kind of a different question, more strategic question, back in September, you talked about how HAL is not interested in financing E&P projects. It\u2019s been a subject, something up quite a bit lately. Can you update us on your thoughts around performance based contracts and is there any desire on Halliburton\u2019s part to invest in these types of projects along side your customers?","Jeff Miller","Yes, thanks. This is -- for us, we call that integrated asset management, and it is really a capital allocation question; it\u2019s where do we put our capital and what will make the best returns. And so, -- and along with those better returns, my view, a key part of that is asset velocity and to produce returns for shareholders. So, we\u2019re not going to tie up our cash and things that we think had longer duration and likely lower returns. We have done some smaller deals, we\u2019ve done a few things, we understand this space. And when we do it, we\u2019ll do it with other people\u2019s money to maintain those kinds of returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. You may begin.","Bill Herbert","Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Jeff and Chris. I guess, a comment with regard to -- I mean, you\u2019ve made some I think some realistic and some encouraging comments with regard to your visibility and the continued pricing strength and tightness in the frac value chain accordingly. What should we expect for incrementals going forward? If you look at Q3 C&P, they were in the low 30s, which is typically reflective of volumetric incremental ramps in pricing, and I recognize that there was some Harvey nose. But, kind of in the market that we expect, not necessarily red hot from an activity standpoint but still tight and pricing still accommodating your utilization, you said that there is runway for improvement. Shouldn\u2019t we expect incrementals to be higher than what we have at the end of the third quarter?","Chris Weber","Yes, this is Chris. We\u2019re not giving guidance on incrementals. We\u2019re focused on margin expansion. We talked about margin improvement and our profitability. When we look at the pace that we\u2019re at, I mean, we got almost a 1,000 basis points of margin expansion in few quarters of C&P. And Jeff spent a lot of time talking about the path towards those normalized margins, the levers that we have to pull. So, we\u2019re confident of that path. Now, remember C&P is more than just frac and P&E in North America. We\u2019ve also got our production business lines; we\u2019re investing in those business lines, looking to grow in line with that Summit acquisition. So, there are other elements of that, but we feel strongly about that path with the levers that we have to pull that Jeff laid out.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And if we could drill down on pricing just a little bit more. I guess the narrative, industry-wide coming into this quarter was that leading edge pricing was still supportive of new build economics. But slope of the event that we witnessed year-to-date was flattening, not flattened, but flattening, and there was still continued convergence between leading edge and legacy pricing. Is that a fair summation as to where pricing stands today?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Bill, I think that\u2019s reasonable. Our guys push price all of the time. And so, maybe not accelerating the way it did in the spring, but still opportunity and momentum in North America. I think if we look at Q3, bit of a cause just as commodity prices bounced into the 40s, but we talked about, first and foremost finding the right customer to drive efficiency, and it doesn\u2019t change the demand for our services today, and along with that comes ability to move on price.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin.","Angie Sedita","So, I appreciate the color on returning to normalize margins for North America. And maybe you could a little bit more about two of the levers, right, utilization and cost cutting, a little bit more color there on how much more you think you have to be done on utilization side as well as on the cost cutting, and maybe even a little bit the timeline on how much we could see that clearing into 2018?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think if the question\u2019s around the path to normalized margins, I\u2019ve always said, it starts with customer urgency. We see that, calendar power being also important in terms of driving utilization and working with the efficient client. In terms of how far there is to move, each of those levers has fair amount of ways to move. I won\u2019t give you the specifics, but it\u2019s one of those things that we work every day. But it\u2019s the precision around, for example what happens on location being able to measure all of those steps. And again, the measurement scale is a bit of a different matter. But, what\u2019s special about that is that now when we make changes and drive efficiency, again driving better utilization, we can drive across just a fleet at a time. And so that gives me a lot of confidence around the ability to improve the number of turns on equipment in a day.","From a cost perspective, we\u2019re constantly working that. I\u2019ve talked about our continuous improvement being one of the pillars of our strategy but really, Angie that\u2019s what we do to systematically drive cost out of all of the components of our business. And often times that includes technology, I referred to some of that in my script. But, it\u2019ll also be technology that takes all kinds of forms, some is customer-facing, a lot of it internally facing, so that all of that value accrues to us in terms of reducing costs. I hope that helps.","Angie Sedita","Yes. That does help. I appreciate that. And then, as an unrelated follow-up. Maybe you could talk a little bit about your fleet today and just as a reminder, how much of your frac fleet that\u2019s in the field today is Q10 versus legacy assets and just thoughts on the life of those assets and replacement or upgrades over time?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, Angie. That\u2019s probably about 60% of the fleet Q10 today. But again, big push several years ago with our retrofit, the fleet with Q10, don\u2019t have that same requirement today, and that\u2019s when we talk about capital, that\u2019s why I\u2019m comfortable with the kind of capital progression we laid out in this kind of market, because there is a very natural sort of replacement that happens over time. I will do that with Q10s, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be -- it won\u2019t be anything like maybe what you\u2019ve seen in the past. And the Q10s really have delivered and we continue to go to market with solidly less horsepower than competitors. And I think that also gets to -- if we think about the industry\u2019s pace of replacement, I think we\u2019re going to well outperform that and that\u2019s going to show up in the form of returns.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Q - Jud Bailey","Thanks. Good morning. Just of follow up on Angie\u2019s question. You highlighted kind of the three levers you still have to pull you think you can pull to get to normalized margins. I\u2019d be curious is -- of the three, is one a bigger driver than the other at this point, or are they all kind of equal or is one going to be a bigger driver? And, is there a way to think about the timing in which to kind of get to that level, is that a still a realistic possibility in 2018?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Short answer, yes, Jud, on to get there in 2018. The pulling on the different levers, you know us; we\u2019re going to pull every lever we got. But those are the big levers that when we pull them, have the more meaningful impact. So, I\u2019m not going to break one above the other necessarily, actually all three of them are very powerful. And we\u2019re working this.","Jud Bailey","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And my follow-up question is you alluded to it in your prepared comments that your strategy on artificial lift and kind of the production side of the business. Could you -- you have Summit, is the strategy to kind of grow that platform across the Halliburton global platform or do you still see other opportunities out there that could supplement Summit on both production chemicals and artificial lift side?","Jeff Miller","Yes, thanks. Well that\u2019s the all of production is an opportunity for us to grow, in our wheelhouse, it\u2019s -- as I talk about our strategy to collaborate an engineered solution, that fits well with what we do. Summit was such a nice add, I give a shout out to the new employees we have from Summit, fantastic business and yes, very scalable. And clearly, the plan is to scale that beyond the U.S. and to our international operations. And those activities are underway. The other components of that, I\u2019ve talked about chemicals. I think that will likely be a more organic move than it is M&A, maybe a little bit a bolt-on around that. But, the guys are working hard at that every day, and I really think that that is something that we will just systematically build out and we\u2019ll talk about it from time-to-time along that path, probably not every quarter but as it continues to grow, we\u2019ll give you a better insight into that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Jim Wicklund","The biggest issue, of course now we\u2019re talking about what 2019 earnings are going to be, but for the last several weeks, you had an all price high enough that E&Ps have been hedging, the head of Total mentioned at a London concert -- conference that U.S. E&Ps have been hedging like crazy, you guys have a little bit of visibility into 2018. I realize your customers really haven\u2019t set their budgets yet. But, the discussions that you are having, are they more constructive now than they were before? Can you give us what little outlook you may be able to have for 2018, as we sit here today?","Jeff Miller","Yes. I mean, Jim, our board is full through the first part of 2018 and the reality is the only people that probably talk to more customers than me is my BD group and I talk to the BD group every day. And so, we\u2019re having constructive conversations about 2018 and encouraging discussions. I think the $50 oil through the planning cycle is a great thing, yes, and I mean this is the right time. And so, they are absolutely planning to work next year, hedges are getting in place. And I think it\u2019s -- interesting thing, when we talk to our customers, we don\u2019t lecture our customers, I mean, we listen to them. Because we listen to them, we hear the message that they are getting from their stakeholders, and I think this is important point. Because all of our -- with all of our conversations, my personal conversations, some are very focused on returns and there are others that are going to shoot them in because they like the acreage that they have. But that\u2019s because that\u2019s what their shareholders want. And at the end of the day, we work for both sets of customers. And so, I am very encouraged going into 2018, Jim.","Jim Wicklund","That\u2019s positive; I\u2019ll take that, good. Second question if I could. Jud mentioned artificial lift; we all know Dover is in the market. Your balance sheet is a little over levered. Can you talk about what the plan is Chris, maybe through 2017 and through 2018 in terms of balance sheet ratios and freedom to do deals?","Chris Weber","Yes. So, I mean, just in terms of the balance sheet and we\u2019ve talked about desire to further delever. I mean, we retired the $1.4 billion earlier this year. We\u2019ve got a maturity in August of next year, $400 million that we plan to retire. We like to see our credit metrics normalize, debt to EBITDA under 2.5 times, debt to cap moving back into 30s and so focused on working towards those metrics.","Jeff Miller","And Jim, I\u2019ll just add the discussion around. Production and some of these things is part of what makes that C&P group a big group, and there is a lot of moving parts in there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Timna Tanners","I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about any future improvement, international in particular, your comments on taking market share, if you can elaborate a little bit on how and where you have been doing that and if you have further rightsizing internationally?","Jeff Miller","Yes. Thanks, Tim. I think that team absolutely executing in the marketplace. I think we are taking share by virtue of the performance that we saw this quarter and we\u2019ve seen for several quarters. But, I think probably what\u2019s more important when we think about international is I think we have a more realistic view what that market is. For example, we\u2019re seeing more activity or at least signs of activity in the form of FIDs and things. But those are not tenders; those don\u2019t convert the service revenue quickly. We did find the bottom, but I think that those are very competitive markets with a lot of visibility around the activity in those international markets. And so, I do believe that the pricing pressure will persist and likely offset a lot of the gains that you might expect from that kind of activity, particularly as we go into 2018.","Timna Tanners","Okay. So, rightsizing may continue there, it sounds like?","Jeff Miller","Yes. And I think that\u2019s just part of a process. It\u2019s a combination of our continuous improvement activities where we\u2019re consistently looking at technology to drive cost out. But, it\u2019s hard; it is taking those things and turning it into how do we operate at lower cost point. And I would say that that team has done that consistently. That\u2019s not a projection. They will just manage all the levers that they have to manage.","Timna Tanners","Okay. And I just want to follow up on Harvey, if there is lingering impact into the fourth quarter and if that -- or if that\u2019s been what\u2019s behind in the third quarter?","Jeff Miller","I think that\u2019s behind as at the end of Q3.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. You may begin.","Scott Gruber","Jeff, I wanted to start with your digital transformation strategy. I think Halliburton is doing more than many investors realize. Can you discuss your broader strategy around this effort, such as the OpenEarth initiative, the Microsoft alliance? And importantly, are E&Ps more willing to share data in the credit environment or how do you work around the reluctance to share data if not and still deliver value enhancing tools?","Jeff Miller","Yes. No, very excited about our strategy and I think we\u2019ve laid that out but it is -- at its heart, and this is an important distinction and open architecture strategy which makes it a lot easier for customers to use. I think there will always be competition around data between customers. And I think customers are taking a closer and closer look at their own data and who owns and controls that data, and I suspect they will control it more so. It is just very competitive for our customers. And so, when we think about that, we want to make certain that we have the right set of tools that can be used effectively by them. And they\u2019re open in the sense that our customers uptake of those tools and they can make them do what they need them to do. And I think tools is probably an oversimplification, I\u2019m describing more of a platform and the philosophy. But, as we work with Microsoft for example, that\u2019s again an ability to leverage I think a lot of investment and R&D and cloud that will help our customers. But again, I will tell you, we are very returns oriented. And so, when I think about what we do, we\u2019re very specific about where we create value and what it proves to us versus necessarily scatter shooting across the space.","Scott Gruber","Got it, appreciate the color. And unrelated follow-up on the domestic frac market and the sand per well trend. What are you hearing from your customers regarding their potential response to falling sand prices as the new local Permian mines come on? Do you anticipate them using more sand per well? Does that uptrend begin to anew? Do they simply go out and drill more wells, which you may hear about through in discussions around on fleet expansion? How do you think they respond to falling sand prices, particularly in the Permian?","Jeff Miller","I think all of our -- that will create -- lower costs, will create more headroom for our clients to work, no question. But I think the more important dynamic in the Permian than the price necessarily today is, is they better understand those reservoirs and how to make the best production at the lower cost per BOE. That\u2019s why I held out the Permian as one where we see sands per well increasing. And I think that\u2019s more evidentiary of our market that\u2019s being learned as opposed to one being optimized and that makes perfect sense and that\u2019s what our customers do. They make the best investment and they manage their business very carefully. And so, when they make decisions to do more of something, there will be a reason for that. I think that\u2019s more the reason in West Texas today as reservoirs are better understood in other parts of the country that\u2019s where you start to see more of that optimization. But, I would expect that it does free up more cash for doing more work, which is certainly positive. But, I would not assume that they don\u2019t optimize in West Texas at some point either.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Wolfe Research. You may begin.","Chase Mulvehill","Good morning, Jeff. So, quick question on the C&P margin side. It came a little bit light of market expectations. Can you talk about what you are seeing as potential bottlenecks on the U.S. completion side and if they had an impact in 3Q?","Jeff Miller","I think as I described earlier specific to margins in C&P, we are making investments in other things, like production group is in that group. And so, there is more going on in that than purely North America frac. But, as it is a different question in terms of what kind of bottlenecks do we see, obviously, the Hurricane drove some bottlenecks here and across the country. I think that as mines come on, a lot of the bottlenecks you hear about around sand get alleviated. Again, when you have a bit of a differentiated view to those things given where we are and the fact our ability to buy at scale particularly with respect to sand, but then equally around people, again, we talk about people lot and our ability to hire the national level for people I think gives us a differentiated position as we view those bottlenecks.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. And the guidance for 4Q on the margin side, you said profitability will be marginally better in 4Q. Was that percentage margins or an absolute margin dollar when you said marginally better?","Chris Weber","Percentage margins.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. So, the last one, on the three levers that you mentioned with pricing utilization and cost reduction, how close are we to optimizing each of these levers?","Jeff Miller","A plenty of room to move on all three.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay.","Jeff Miller","I mean that\u2019s what we do every day; we\u2019re always working on those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. You may begin.","Sean Meakim","So, Chris noted in the marginally better margins, but on the D&E specifically, trying to get a better sense of sustainability of that 3Q run rate, given pricing remains pretty challenging internationally, activities up but not dramatically. Could you give a little more context with that move in the margin to give a sense of the look forward?","Jeff Miller","I mean, if the question is, are the one-offs in there, the reality there aren\u2019t any one-offs in there; that group is absolutely executing very well, and I would say systematically driving cost out of the business, they winning the contracts they need to win and they are -0 we continue to drive technology into the D&E group that I think is paying off. And I\u2019ve talked about the investment we\u2019ve made in Sperry for some time. And I think that\u2019s beginning to pay off. I think there is a lot of runway actually left to go there. But, it will come probably in fits and starts as we go into next year.","Sean Meakim","Okay. Thank you for that Jeff. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on -- following up on the expansion plans for production and Summit. How do you think about strategically owning assets versus aligning Halliburton in partnerships with others where you\u2019re trying to expand your reach globally?","Jeff Miller","With respect to production specifically, it will be -- we\u2019ll invest in those things that we think we can uniquely use to drive value for us; in those places where we can\u2019t, we\u2019ll look to partner. I -- very much the strategy being executed now. So, I won\u2019t get into all -- anymore details than that. But I would say, generally speaking, we\u2019re not afraid to and in fact we will seek to, in some cases partner with companies that we believe are in businesses that we don\u2019t want to be in, but maybe form part of the value chain. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to do that very effectively. In fact with rigs, we work very closely with rig contractors and had a lot of success in our project management business, driving lower cost and better returns, probably for us and the rig contractor than we would, if we were somehow jointly investing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Kurt Hallead","I was wondering if you can give us an update, generate significant amount of cash and maybe kind of run through the priorities on that cash again for us between growth, dividend, buying back stock. And when you think about the growth dynamics, where would you be directing that? It sounds like North America, but just looking for some color on that.","Chris Weber","Yes. This is Chris. I\u2019ll take that. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of use of free cash flow, we are still focused on debt retirement and we have the $400 million maturity next year that we intend to pay off. We\u2019ll consider growth opportunities, both acquisitions and organic and want to be value accretive, generate industry-leading service company returns, and that\u2019s in terms of absolute level and the speed with which we realize those returns or short duration or rapid payback. And after that, we\u2019ll look at returning cash to shareholders and considering both dividends and share buybacks.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, great. And maybe follow-up to one of the prior questions when you kind of talk about your three levers, trying to get back to normalized earnings. In your mind, Jeff, which one of those three would probably carry the most weight in 2018, as you see it right now?","Jeff Miller","We\u2019ll have to see when 2018 gets here, Kurt. I mean, we use all of them that are available. And I am not -- and I will tell you, I put sort of equal time in all three of them. I\u2019ll just go back to sort of Chris\u2019s view -- incredible, as he mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve come a long way, two quarters and we will continue to use all of those levers as we move into next year.","Chris Weber","Yes, and this is Chris. Like we said, we\u2019re on the path, fourth quarter with the seasonality and weather, holidays, customer budgets, I mean, obviously not representative of what that normal path looks like, but with the margin guidance, the revenue guidance that we provided, we think that\u2019s generally aligned with consensus estimate.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Okay. Thank you, Shannon. Look, I\u2019d like to wrap the call up with a couple of key takeaways today. First, the third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the effectiveness of our strategy. I thank all of our employees for their commitment to execution. Finally, I expect Halliburton\u2019s relative performance in 2018 will remain strong as a result of our ability to grow North America revenue and margins and improve our position in our international businesses. So, I look forward to talking with you next quarter. Shannon, you may close out the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. ","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. ","Abu Zeya","Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days.","Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO.","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2018; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30th, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Abu, and good morning, everyone. As the second half of 2019 unfolds, US and international markets continue to diverge. International activity growth is gaining momentum across multiple regions. Meanwhile, operators' capital discipline weighs on North American activity levels.","That said, our outstanding employees executed effectively in the third quarter. We managed the market dynamics and delivered on our financial results as per expectations. ","Let me cover some headlines. Total company revenue was $5.6 billion and operating income was $536 million, representing decreases of 6% and 3% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2019.","Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue was down 4% sequentially, but operating income grew 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our international D&E operating margin increased 180 basis points. Overall, D&E margin performance was negatively impacted by weaker demand for our services in North America.","Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 8% sequentially, driven by lower completions activity in North America land. C&P operating margin was essentially flat compared to the second quarter, supported by strong international activity and the execution of our new playbook in North America.","International revenue was flat sequentially, but is up 10% year-to-date. Lower project management and stimulation activity in the Middle East and Asia offset healthy growth in Latin America and Europe\/Eurasia in the third quarter.","North America revenue decreased 11% sequentially, primarily driven by customer activity declines.","And finally, we generated approximately $530 million of free cash flow in the third quarter, a significant improvement over the first half of the year.","In the third quarter, supply and demand uncertainties continued to impact commodity prices. On the one hand, Iran sanctions, Venezuela production declines, and political instability in Latin America and North Africa are constraining supply. On the other hand, there is near-term uncertainty in demand due to ongoing US-China trade tensions and negative economic data out of Asia and Europe.","As the US production growth continues to weigh on supply, OPEC+ extended its agreement until March 2020 to manage production and support oil prices.","Even with these crosscurrents, international growth continues at a steady pace. This summer, I spent a month visiting our customers in the Eastern Hemisphere, and I'm excited by what I saw, consistently improving markets across Europe, Asia, and Australia. This confirms my confidence in Halliburton delivering high-single digit international revenue growth this year.","It is important to note that both of our divisions are meaningfully contributing to our international growth. Our Drilling and Evaluation division traditionally had the most exposure to international markets, with about 70% of division revenues coming from outside North America.","The revenue split has generally been the opposite for our Completion and Production division. We're pleased to see the C&P division increasing its participation in the international markets in this cycle. Year-to-date, international C&P revenue has grown 13%, double the international revenue growth rate of D&E.","In today's environment, customers aim to squeeze every available barrel from their existing assets. So, mature fields development is prominent.","We also see increased unconventional activity in several international regions. The technology mix required for development-focused, production-oriented, and unconventional project plays to our C&P portfolio strengths.","With a focus on the international mature fields market, we're growing our production group, part of the C&P division that comprises artificial lift, specialty chemicals, and well intervention solutions.","Historically, Halliburton primarily participated in the drilling and completion stages of a well's lifecycle. With our expansion into production services, we're tapping into a long-term, later cycle market with significant growth potential.","Our well intervention business helps operators diagnose field productivity issues and design and deliver immediate impact solutions leveraging our custom chemistries and tools. ","This capability is critical for mature fields. With rig-less intervention and well surveillance activity increasing, especially in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, we've already executed multiple contract startups in 13 different countries this year.","In Latin America, we've recently deployed our SPECTRUM FUSION hybrid coil tubing service for a customer in Colombia. In a single trip, with the well still producing, we provided real-time visualization of the shape and location of old perforations and performed production logging, while maintaining the ability to circulate fluid to clean the well as needed. The customer gathered valuable downhole insights without having to take the well off-production.","In the last couple of years, we've had a significant uptick in unconventional activity in several Middle Eastern countries as well as in Argentina and Australia. Our production enhancement business demonstrated strong international growth year-to-date, benefiting from these developments.","Halliburton leveraged our experience in US shales to provide a customized application of technology, logistics management, and operational excellence to maximize asset value for our international customers.","In Argentina, Halliburton delivered the highest number of frac stages to date in the third quarter as a result of consistent execution and applying service efficiency best practices in the Vaca Muerta shale play.","Our completion tools and cementing businesses also increased international revenue and margins on the back of strong activity recovery in the UK and Norway sectors of the North Sea, IOC activity expansion in Brazil and Mexico, and increased demand from Asia and the Middle East.","We grew cementing services as well as installations of casing equipment and intelligent multi-lateral and core completion solutions for customers in all these markets. ","For example, this summer, we installed a multi-lateral completion to increase reservoir exposure and inflow control in an operator's mature field in Norway. This intelligent completion system allowed the operator to manage production from each of the four laterals without impacting production from the others in the event of a gas influx or water breakthrough.","To be clear, our Drilling and Evaluation businesses are also meaningfully contributing to our international growth. As you know, Halliburton entered this international recovery a much stronger competitor due in large part to technology investments we've made in key services like drilling, LWD, open hole wireline, and testing.","Recently, an operator recognized Halliburton wireline as a benchmark for service quality and execution in an ultra-deepwater exploration campaign in West Africa. Open hole wireline data collected at water depth over 10,000 feet helped the customer to confirm significant additional reserves and successfully determine fracture enclosure pressure in sand and shale formations.","In the Norwegian North Sea, an operator has adopted our latest logging-while-drilling innovation, the EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity service as a standard in their exploration wells.","The customer's target formation has exceedingly complex geometry, making it hard to interpret using conventional methods. The unique 3D inversion capability of the EarthStar sensor is the only LWD technology capable of reliably mapping such complex structures.","Looking to 2020, I see more international topline and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton coming from mature fields and shallow water markets. Barring a global economic slowdown, a broader offshore recovery should add momentum to the international growth going forward.","Offshore rig count increased 19% year-on-year and sanctioned FID volumes are up 20% compared to last year, led by Guyana, Brazil and Azerbaijan project sanctions.","Recently, Woodside Energy awarded Halliburton drilling and completion services for its deepwater field development campaign in offshore Senegal. It's due for the final investment decision in December and work is planned to start in late 2020 or early 2021. ","The campaign is expected to include 18 wells with up to 8 optional wells over an estimated 3 to 4 year term. Halliburton was awarded the well construction, lower completions, e-line, slick line cold tubing and well testing services. We have also announced several new offshore project wins this year in Latin America and the Middle East.","Our pipeline of projects is strong and I expect Halliburton to outperform the growth in international drilling and completion spending next year. Increasing activity and improving pricing across markets, our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocating assets to the markets where we can earn the highest returns, I believe, will improve our international margins going forward.","In North America, the market is very different. Customer spending has decreased and is largely concentrated in the first half of the year. The US land rig count declined 11% from the second to the third quarter for the first time in 10 years. And while, historically, the third quarter used to be the busiest in terms of hydraulic fracturing activity in the US, stage counts declined every month this quarter.","As a result, the market for both drilling and completion services in North America softened during the third quarter, impacting service company activity, and Halliburton was no exception.","Throughout the third quarter, pricing pressures continued as operators tried to lower overall costs in order to meet their cash flow objectives.","We are the execution company. So, let's talk about how we are proactively executing our North America playbook with a clear purpose to generate returns and free cash flow. ","This is what it looks like. We are stacking equipment. In the third quarter, we stacked more equipment than we did in the first six months of the year. While this impacts our revenues, we would rather err on the side of stacking than work for insufficient margins and wear out our equipment.","We're reducing costs. You've seen us do this before. We took out $1 billion in 2016. We reorganized and reduced our fixed costs in North America earlier this year. We continue to evaluate the way we work and we'll keep reducing costs in our North American operations.","We're aligning with the right customers. We are and continue to be aligned with the customer groups that are spending and that value our services.","We're deploying technology that lowers our cost and accrues value to Halliburton. Take integrated well completions, for example. It is a combination of wireline and fracturing services. It is one thing to have both product lines and another thing to integrate them technically and culturally and achieve lower cost on location. It takes R&D effort to develop a host of new proprietary technologies that enable this integration.","Halliburton's integrated well completions offering minimizes non-productive time, improves efficiency, reduces personnel on location and capital costs for Halliburton. This technology integration, which is hard to duplicate, improves customer efficiency, but, more importantly, it improves our margins.","These actions allows us to maximize our active fleet utilization and protect our margins. Our third quarter results demonstrate that our new North America playbook is working and is the right approach for this market.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we see more of the same. We expect customer activity to decline across all basins in North America land, impacting both our drilling and completion businesses.","Feedback from our customers leads us to believe that the rig count and completions activity may be lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. While holidays and potential weather impacts are the usual culprits, other drivers of this continued activity decline are our customers' free cash flow generation commitments, an oversupplied gas market and concerns about oil demand softness in 2020.","Given the reduction and cadence in customer spending that we see, we plan to further change the way we deliver our services in order to improve our margins and maximize returns.","In the fourth quarter, consistent with our playbook, we plan to undertake further cost reductions by streamlining our operations and corporate functions. We're still finalizing our estimates, but expect to capture approximately $300 million in annualized cost savings over the next few quarters.","Importantly, regardless of the cuts and idling of equipment, the size and scale of our business in North America give us the ability to drive a sustainable model without sacrificing our leadership position. I believe that the actions we are taking will enable Halliburton to evolve and emerge stronger in the future.","So, what changes the narrative for North America going forward? While the cadence of activity will likely remain the same over the near term, there are a few other key trends we're watching closely today that should play out over time and alter the market dynamics in US land.","First, attrition. Given demand deceleration, the service industry has adjusted accordingly and cut capital spend this year. There were hardly any new equipment additions and maintenance spending has been severely curtailed. All the while, service intensity showed no signs of slowing down. Multiwell pad penetration continued, lateral length kept growing and proppant loading increased further. ","The direct result of higher service intensity, especially in terms of hours pumped per day, is the increase in maintenance frequency. This should accelerate the long-awaited equipment attrition from the market, both voluntary through stacking and involuntary.","As I said at the beginning of the year, there would be less horsepower available in the market at the end of the year than there was in January. We can now see this happening as service companies are cannibalizing stacked equipment for parts rather than paying for replacement components due to budget constraints. We expect attrition to continue into 2020.","At Halliburton, our size and scale allow us to flex down with the market and generate sufficient free cash flow to keep our active fleet healthy. We benefit from in-house manufacturing, digital preventative maintenance protocols, ongoing materials R&D and automation efforts to increase equipment lifespan. These are unique competitive advantages that are hard and expensive to replicate in this market.","Second, some of our customers are changing their buying behavior. They have started contracting for services and integrated packages rather than discreetly. This helps tie up multiple services, compresses the learning curve and drives cost savings and efficiencies for both us and our customers. This is similar to how the North Sea has volved over the last few years.","We're currently working on integrated projects with customers in the Bakken and the Permian. The collaboration has resulted in better performance and helped secure longer-term customer commitment.","Some companies are increasingly centralizing the management of their procurement activities. This should lead to supplier rationalization and concentration of a larger share of the work with a select number of high quality, safe and efficient service companies.","We believe that these new customer-buying behaviors uniquely position Halliburton to get an outsized share of their spend.","Finally, one more trend we are watching is the deceleration of incremental US production growth brought about by capital discipline. The record-breaking 2018 growth will not be replicated in 2019. In fact, current projections for 2020 indicate a further decline in production from the current-year estimates.","To maximize production per every CapEx dollar they spend, operators will require technologies that can improve both efficiencies and well productivity. Instead of counting stages, they will want to make every stage count. For this, I believe, they will turn to Halliburton.","We bring to the table technologies like automated fracturing and distributed fiber optic sensing that are tailor-made for addressing production challenges. While customers are mostly focused on price today, early studies confirm our technologies work. They are hard to replicate and will be more valuable to Halliburton over time.","Also, with declining US incremental contribution to world production, non-US production will be required to fill the gap. This means more growth in international and offshore markets and more opportunities for Halliburton.","As the international recovery continues and the North American market matures, our strategy will allow us to thrive in this dynamic environment. I believe that the actions I have described to you today will ensure that Halliburton continues to improve its earnings power and generate strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns in the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lance for a financial update. Lance?","Lance Loeffler","Thank you, Jeff. And good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2019. ","Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion and operating income was $536 million, representing decreases of 6% and 3% respectively. North America led the decline as a result of activity and pricing headwinds. ","Let me go over the details of our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.5 billion, a decrease of $299 million or 8%, while operating income was $446 million, a decrease of $24 million or 5%.","These results were primarily driven by lower pressure pumping activity and pricing in North America land, coupled with decreased completion tool sales in Latin America and reduced simulation activity in the Middle East\/Asia.","Partially offsetting these declines were increased cementing activity in the eastern hemisphere, improved completion tool sales in Europe\/Africa\/CIS, and higher simulation activity in Latin America.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2 billion, a decrease of $81 million or 4%, while operating income was $150 million, an increase of $5 million or 3%.","These results were driven by reduced drilling and wireline activity in North America and lower project management activity in Middle East\/Asia. These declines were partially offset by higher drilling activity in the eastern hemisphere, fluids activity in Latin America and higher testing and software sales globally, resulting in better overall margins.","Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue in the third quarter of 2019 was $2.9 billion, an 11% decrease, primarily associated with lower activity and pricing in pressure pumping and well construction services in North America land.","In Latin America, revenue was $608 million, a 6% increase, resulting primarily from higher activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, increased testing activity and artificial lift sales across the region, and improved fluids activity in Mexico. These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales in Brazil. ","Turning to Europe\/Africa\/CIS, revenue was $831 million, which was essentially flat with the second quarter. Higher activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, the Caspian and North Sea offset lower activity in West Africa.","In the Middle East\/Asia, revenue was $1.2 billion, a 4% decrease, largely resulting from reduced project management and simulation activity across the region. These declines were partially offset by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Indonesia.","In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $60 million. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will revert to our average run rate of approximately $65 million.","Our net interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same in the fourth quarter.","Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 20%, coming in slightly lower than anticipated due to certain discrete tax benefits. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be 23% based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. Our full-year effective tax rate should be approximately 22%.","We generated $871 million of cash from operations in the third quarter. Our free cash flow generation for the quarter was approximately $530 million and we reached positive free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. ","We believe further improvement in receivables and a drawdown and inventory in the fourth quarter will allow us to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year.","Capital expenditures during the quarter were $345 million and our 2019 full-year CapEx guidance remains unchanged. We told you last quarter that our capital spend in 2020 would be significantly less than $1.6 billion. ","We are carefully monitoring the market dynamics in North America and will exercise prudent judgment to make further adjustments according to the anticipated activity levels in 2020.","Finally, let me provide you with some comments on our operations outlook for the fourth quarter. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to be flat to up low single-digits, with margin improvement in the range of 425 basis points to 475 basis points.","This is driven by year-end software and product sales combined with activity increases across our international markets, offset by lower demand in North America land.","In our Completion and Production division, we believe our sequential revenue will be down low-double digits, with margins expected to decline 125 basis points to 175 basis points.","As Jeff stated, in North America, we have continued to stack equipment that does not meet our returns threshold and we will be proactive in reducing costs.","We anticipate that higher activity in Asia and the Middle East will be offset by activity declines in North America land, Latin America, and Europe and Eurasia.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff?","Jeffrey Miller ","Thanks, Lance. In summary, international growth continues at a steady pace across multiple regions, benefiting both our D&E and C&P divisions. Increased activity, pricing improvements, our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocation of our assets should lead to higher international margins as we look past this year.","In North America, we expect activity reductions to continue into the fourth quarter. Halliburton is successfully executing our new North America playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow.","We stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue managing utilization with a focus on returns. We're aligning with the right customers. We're introducing new technologies to improve margins. And we will continue to take actions that lower the overall service delivery cost.","I want to close by thanking our employees for their outstanding focus and dedication to our company and our customers. Your resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company's strength and why together we can continue delivering on our promise to our shareholders.","And now, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","James West","Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance. ","Jeffrey Miller","Good morning, James.","Lance Loeffler","Good morning, James.","James West","So, Jeff, obviously, [technical difficulty] third quarter. Fourth quarter, as Lance described is just going to be fairly tough. What does this mean for the exit rate and how are we going to 2020 and how the outlook there starts to shape up?","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. Thanks, James. You're a little crackly there at the beginning, but as we look at the Q4 activity, obviously, we think budget exhaustion, et cetera, starts to bring that down. I expect we'll see an uptick as we go into Q1 of 2020, and I think that's a little bit getting to that cadence of spend. So, I think that we'll be increasing activity certainly in the first half \u2013 first quarter and then really first half of 2020, and our playbook will have us ready to take advantage of that.","James West","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, as we talk about the playbook or think about the playbook, what are you seeing from your competition? Clearly, some of these guys can't actually perform at the same levels or will not perform at the same levels, but also some may follow you on your returns-focused strategy. What have you seen so far from you showing leadership here with your willingness to walk away from the underperforming contracts or low return [ph] contracts versus your peers?","Jeffrey Miller","James, we're early in that process now. And, I guess, my view is we know we are extremely competitive. We have very good margins and returns in that business relative to anyone in that marketplace. And so, when we see an opportunity where it transacts well below cost, we're pretty comfortable stepping back from that just because we don't want to burn up our equipment without making the kind of returns and cash flow that we want to make. So, to be seen, I fully expect we'll see the \u2013 we see it actually some today, the flight to quality. Our service delivery is very, very good; our safety performance is very, very good. And so, I think this unfolds as equipment just gets tighter. And I think we're well-positioned in this market.","James West","Got it. Thanks, guys. ","Jeffrey Miller","Thank you.","Lance Loeffler","Thanks, James.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Angeline Sedita","Good morning, guys. ","Jeffrey Miller","Good morning, Angie.","Lance Loeffler","Good morning, Angie. ","Angeline Sedita","Good morning. So, Jeff, maybe a little bit more color on the international markets and the visibility there, I think there's some debate about the pace of growth for 2020. So, I'd love to hear what you're seeing out there and the prospects for having similar growth rates in 2020 as you did in 2019, and maybe you could also touch on the growth you saw in C&P versus D&E?","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. Thanks, Angie. Less clear on \u2013 we just don't have the visibility on 2020 at this point because it's still early. That said, I believe Halliburton outgrows the increase in drilling and completion spend, whatever that is internationally. And as I described, I think we've got a good set of contracts set up for 2020. And, technically, we're very well-positioned for 2020. And so, without trying to put a number on that today, I feel Halliburton will be very competitive in that space, anyway. Yeah.","Angeline Sedita","Okay. Okay. So, maybe on your remarks on the attrition, it'd be great to hear any additional color on attrition and retirements for Halliburton and what you're hearing for the industry as a whole for even this year and next year, and how much supply you think could be pulled out of the market?","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. As I've always said, it's hard to see attrition until there's a call on the equipment, but it's pretty clear there's less equipment in the market today than there was at the beginning of the year, and that amount varies in terms of how people call it. We think it's 15% to 20% easily in the marketplace. But then, we watch equipment adds, of which there really aren't any, and we know how hard equipment is working. And so, I really believe we will continue to see that as we go into even 2020 in terms of the attrition happening. And our view of the market is we want to be super careful with our equipment. We want to work it for returns and when we don't see those returns, we want to set it to the side.","Angeline Sedita","Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Jeffrey Miller","Thanks, Angie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Sean Meakim","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeffrey Miller","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Meakim","So, on free cash flow, I was hoping we could get a little bit more granular on the quarter and the guide. So, collections improved, I think, as we expected, but payables also fell a good amount. Inventory is still growing. CapEx is unchanged for the year. Sounds like earnings power is going to be challenged in the fourth quarter. So the $900 million of free cash that you're effectively guiding for this quarter is dependent upon working capital to a large degree. Could you maybe just walk us through those pieces?","Lance Loeffler","Yeah, Sean. Let me take a stab at that. So, look, we did make considerable improvements in 3Q. I think that that momentum clearly has to continue into 4Q, and it's really done \u2013 as you talk about the working capital movements, we continue to believe that we're going to progress on the way that we're collecting our receivables expect inventory will draw down as we deliver on our completion tools orders for the fourth quarter. And my belief is that working capital on a year-on-year basis is still relatively flat in 2019. ","Sean Meakim","Okay.","Lance Loeffler","I'd also say, in addition to the working capital goals that we have in the fourth quarter, we're also going to be down on CapEx as well. The rate of spend of CapEx that will contribute to that free cash flow number.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Thank you for that.","Jeffrey Miller","And then, maybe just on the D&E margin ramp, some moving pieces there too. In the third quarter, top line fell, but margins expanded. So, you had got North America. It's challenging on the top line, but you're getting some progress where you're trying to go on the international side. For the fourth quarter, it seems like similar dynamics, but a little bit different. The international is helping you more given the year-end product sales, et cetera. Are we getting those moving parts correctly and then, can we just get a little bit more of an update on how iCruise is fitting into that relatively? What your expectations would have been, say, 9, 12 months ago?","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. thanks, Sean. I'll start with the second part of that question. The iCruise is really delivering what we had expected though it is obviously \u2013 some of the contracts we were targeting or have been won, but are moving a bit to the right. That said, the performance of the tool, very good, very excited about what it can do, and coupled with EarthStar, for example, really is delivering on the technical promise that we had hoped. So, I expect, as I look through Q4 and into 2020 and beyond that the value of this suite of technology is going to be very impactful. In fact, I'll just comment here, at the World Oil Awards this week, actually the best drilling technology was the EarthStar 3D Inversion which is fantastic technology.","So, to get back to progression, we kind of see a longer ramp on the recovery of that business, but all of the building blocks are in place and the technical approach is working, and I see us winning the kind of contracts that I think are required to earn higher margins.","Sean Meakim","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Scott Gruber","Yes. Good morning. ","Jeffrey Miller","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","Good morning. Staying on D&E margins, I know you guys typically forecast just one quarter ahead, but I was curious about a bit of color on 1Q. How should we think about margins going into next year? You have a bit more North Sea exposure at this point. Has that changed the seasonality? Are we going to see a little more seasonal impact on D&E margins or is there still sufficient underlying profit improvement that you can offset and have more normal seasonal margin performance in 1Q?","Lance Loeffler","Scott, this is Lance. Appreciate the question. I think looking ahead, I think there's still going to be some seasonality in 1Q. We're still dealing with weather in the Northern Hemisphere as we traditionally see it. But I think, overall, as you think about where international margins can go, based on some of the comments Jeff made prior, I think not only are you seeing the investment in technology come to fruition and what we expect, but also just generally more activity in the international markets help improve \u2013 also seeing better pricing in certain regions around the world. That comes because of the tightness of tools, et cetera, that will drive that. So, I think that there is, obviously, continued progression on where we see international margins going, not just in the fourth quarter, but into next year.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And then, on the $300 million of cost savings, obviously, you'll get a bit in 4Q. Can you just provide a bit more color on how that phases in over the next few quarters and whether there's any offset in terms of severance or facility closure cost and how large those could be?","Lance Loeffler","Yeah. Scott, I'm not going get into the details today on that. I think the point is is that we're focused on lowering our service delivery costs. And I think probably the most important point is is that we're being decisive, right? We're looking to move quickly around cost reductions in North America. We've seen some of those actions \u2013 seen some of the benefit of those actions that we took in 2Q. I'd just say stay tuned over the course of the next couple of quarters.","Jeffrey Miller","I think just to add to that, when we think about our North America playbook which is driving specifically towards utilization and efficiency and cost, I think this playbook is right squarely in the middle of the types of decisive actions we're taking around taking out costs. ","Scott Gruber","Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Jeffrey Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey. Good morning, fellas. I guess I just want to follow-up on Scott's question here. So, maybe on 4Q for D&E, I don't know if you can maybe help us kind of understand how much of the improvement in margin on the revenue side is attributed to kind of the software sales that you typically get in the fourth quarter? And then, along those lines, how much of the $300 million of cost savings are included in your 4Q guide?","Lance Loeffler","Yeah. Appreciate the question, Chase. Look, I think in terms of the impact on software and product sales for the fourth quarter, it's relatively the same as we saw last year. So, not above or below what we experienced last year. ","On the cost-cutting side, look, again, I'm not going to get into the details today on the call on how that transforms over the next couple of quarters, but we will keep you posted as that continues to develop.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay, all right. Follow-up. Listening to the prepared remarks, Jeff, you talked about your more integrated packages that you're seeing in US onshore. Maybe could you expand a little bit, what kind of customers you're seeing kind of push more towards integrated packages? And is this more on the drilling side, the completion side or both?","Jeffrey Miller","I'd really say it's both. And it's customers of all sizes quite frankly, but probably more to the \u2013 larger into that. And I think some of that's just reflect \u2013 look, this is the early days, but it's encouraging because I know the type of safety and service quality performance that we have in the market and the ability to put more things together, I think, drives better performance over time. It's really a collective investment and a learning curve that drives that kind of efficiency. And we've seen that actually evolve in the North Sea. So, while early days North America, very early days, I think there's an analog which was the North Sea, which was obviously a very disintermediated market probably just five or six years ago and we've seen roughly 90% of our work today in the North Sea is in some form or fashion of integrated or bundled or in some form or fashion a more stable set of work that is more outcome-based that then allows us to, over time, demonstrate really some of the things that make Halliburton so reliable and so efficient over the long term. ","Chase Mulvehill","Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff. I'll turn it back over.","Jeffrey Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open. ","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning.","Jeffrey Miller","Good morning. ","Lance Loeffler","Good morning, Kurt. ","Kurt Hallead","Appreciate all that color so far. Good stuff. The question I had for you initially here is on the US\/North American frac, Completion and Production side of the business, right? You guys talked about a cost reduction effort that's underway, focus on the right players, et cetera. However, it looks like the market is still going to be kind of devoid of pricing, right? So, when we think about the \u2013 or when you guys think about your business in US, and US frac, in particular, beyond your cost reductions and pricing, do you think there is other ways you can drive margin improvement, Jeff?","Jeffrey Miller","Yes, I do. I think, strategically \u2013 technology is always an important part of this business and we continue to invest in technology. And some of that technology allows us to lower our cost. And we don't necessarily spend a lot of time talking about that simply because it's not for sale. I want to keep it and have that benefit accrue to Halliburton.","I talked about one just this quarter on the call with integrated completions, but that's more complicated to do than meets the eye and it actually drives a lot of cost savings for Halliburton.","When we direct our efforts that way, that is part of the sustainable competitive advantage we have around not just cost cutting \u2013 actually, I don't see it as cost cutting. I see the playbook actually is strategically driving better efficiency and better margins sort of in the face of where the market is today. ","And I say all of that \u2013 and I want to pivot to what I really think the future looks like, which, over the next few years, the dialogue I believe will be more around recovery factors in unconventionals and less about just pure speed. And I think, in that market, some of the things we're doing with Prodigi and a host of things that I think will be quite impactful in that future scenario, which the future \u2013 what, a couple years out, but I'm really excited about that also. And nothing we're doing today gets in the way of delivering on that future set of technologies.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. That's great color. Then you indicated \u2013 you gave us some sense on attrition. Say, on a general basis, it runs maybe 15% to 20% per year. And then, given the dynamics at play in the marketplace with companies not generating enough free cash to put into the maintenance, what would be your assessment above and beyond that 15% to 20%? I know you didn't really \u2013 maybe not want to comment on it, but maybe pressing a little bit here, kind of give us your best guess as to what you think it could be given the underinvestment in the business?","Jeffrey Miller","Look, I think this is something that accelerates, particularly as we get into 2020. We'll see an uptick in the first half of the year, first quarter, and I think there will be stress in the system at that point. The extent to which there isn't new investment in this business, that just continues to wear on equipment. So, it has to accelerate over time.","Kurt Hallead","All right. Jeff, I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Dan Boyd","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey Miller","Good morning, Dan.","Lance Loeffler","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Boyd","So, thinking about the 300 million in cost savings over the next three quarters, can you give us an idea on how much that is fixed versus variable?","Jeffrey Miller","I think most of that would be more in the fixed category, not the variable. The variable costs, we're managing all of the time. And, in fact, our ability to flex up and down on variable cost allows us to be, I think, hyper responsive to moves in the marketplace. But when we attack \u2013 the type of fixed cost things are the parts that \u2013 that's the removal of the waste that is permanent when we think about continuous improvement and driving there. And that's what you saw in the second quarter as well. It was a move around taking out waste. And so, that tends to come in steps as we sort of evaluate how best to get that efficiency and then we're able to move on the cost.","Dan Boyd","Okay, great. And then, Lance, just going back to the D&E margins, I think what we're all trying to figure out is just what the go-forward run rate is, exit any kind of 4Q seasonality. So, earlier this year, we talked about flat margins year-on-year. Looks like they're maybe going to come in a little bit below, closer to 8%. But should we be thinking about the new run rate being in the double-digit range on an annual basis or is it just too early to say?","Lance Loeffler","I think to try to call 2020, it's probably a little early, but we firmly believe that margins in D&E and the international markets are higher than where they are today. Obviously, we've got room to run. I think as the markets continue to improve and for the things that I sort of talked about maybe on an earlier question around activity, leads to tool tightness, more constructive pricing discussions and further implementation of our technology, particularly on the drilling side, we're encouraged by what we see. So, yes, the goal is to be higher than where we are today, clearly, but little too early to call on what would be our expectations for a 2020 market.","Jeffrey Miller","Maybe just to add to that if I could. The other important part of this is, as we manage capital, we are reallocating assets where we believe we need to in order to drive those margins up. So, we see tool tightness in the marketplace broadly. And, clearly, we're going to move those assets to where they make the best returns. And so, I think that, in and of itself, drives better margins over time. And at the same time, we do have the ability to meet and exceed growth rates, I believe, internationally.","Dan Boyd","Maybe just kind of sneak one more in on that. When you look at the margin improvement then in D&E, Lance, how much of it would you just \u2013 if you had to put it in two buckets of \u2013 one self-help and then the other one just being external market growth and pricing. How should we think about that?","Lance Loeffler","I would weight that to the latter\u2026","Dan Boyd","Okay.","Lance Loeffler","\u2026in terms of activity and pricing.","Dan Boyd","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey Miller","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.","David Anderson","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. So, aside from the pressure pumping aspect, I was wondering about what other parts of your North American business have been impacted by the new playbook? I know part of this is you're looking at every business in terms of its returns. I was just kind of curious, how many of those product lines are kind of underwater in terms of returns? I just wonder if you can just kind of help us understand how this new playbook is impacting the other parts of your business.","Jeffrey Miller","I think it has an impact on all parts of our business. I think our view to, obviously, improving returns will get to other parts of the business. And I think that anything we do, in some cases, to take out fixed costs also have an impact on other parts of the business. So, can't do one really without the other. We like all of our businesses in North America. And I think they all benefit a degree from the approach we're taking with frac. So, it's probably more pronounced with frac.","David Anderson","Okay. I was just curious, there's been a lot of talk about the digital space over the past quarter. You announced 10 new applications on your DecisionSpace 365 digital platform. But as we kind of look out there and we see a lot of promise out there. I was just curious how you're thinking about the investment required. A bit of an arms race going on it seems like out there. But can you give us a sense as to how much your R&D spending is today dedicated towards digital and how are you thinking about spending kind of going forward over the next few years in that space?","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. I think the capital and R&D spend around that is included in sort of our run rate. So, I don't think it's going to be outsized to what you've seen us do in the past. I think the \u2013 we really like our landmark business. We are a leading software provider in the industry. We hosted an important event in Houston. We had 1,300 customers at our event in Houston to look at sort of the future of digital and had thought leaders who are also our clients present at that event.","But I think the key focus and where we will spend more time talking to you, it will be around how it's monetized because I think that's really the important component of all things digital, which is \u2013 in my view, it's internal efficiency, enhanced tools that we charge more for and then software sales and consulting that we sell directly to clients. And you hear me talk about those at different times. I'll try to frame them better, but if I think our enhanced tools, 3D inversion is a good example of that with EarthStar, that has a lot of digital involved in making it work. Internal efficiencies look like things like our maintenance, it's automated, and digital planning and manufacturing. And then, 365 being one of the products that we actually sell, both in the cloud and the subscription model.","So, I'm comfortable with where we are. In fact, I really like where we are digitally and I think the digital principles that we laid out early around being open architecture, evolving with partners, and then clearly making returns for Halliburton are the right \u2013 that is absolutely the right strategy.","David Anderson","Great. Thanks, Jeff. ","Jeffrey Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open.","Marc Bianchi","Thank you. I wanted to ask \u2013 first on CapEx, I suspect you guys aren't looking to get into what you expect to spend in 2020. But just looking where the run rate is here in third quarter and then saying it's going to be again lower in fourth, is that the right way to think about the CapEx that you think the business needs on a go-forward basis?","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. I think the timing of the spend is more weighted, obviously, towards the first part of the year just because that's when tools are actually going to work and a lot of the planning goes on as we look to next year. We have a view of where we want things to be and when we want them to be there.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. Thanks for that, Jeff. And back on the $300 million of cost save, is that the right amount of cost save for this level of revenue or how are you thinking about what level of revenue the business will be sized for once you complete that program?","Jeffrey Miller","Look, I think that we continuously take waste out of the business and look for ways to operate it at a lower cost point. So, that's kind of the step that we see right now that is effective. But at the same time, we're always looking for ways to make the business more and more efficient and we'll continue to do that almost irrespective of what we think the revenues are or will be.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. ","Jeffrey Miller","Yeah. Thank you, Shannon. Look in closing, I'm excited about the international outlook and how Halliburton is positioned to benefit from these improving conditions.","The combination of increased activity, pricing improvements, ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocation of our assets should lead to higher international margins as I look towards the future. ","Our North America playbook is working. We're driving lower costs, better asset utilization and market-leading returns in the near term, while concurrently developing technology that lowers our cost or is essential to our customers over the longer-term, principally unconventional resource recovery, drilling and digital and all technologies where Halliburton is uniquely positioned to win.","So, thank you. I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Shannon, you can close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.  [Operator instructions.]  As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2013 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is available on Halliburton website.","Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Jeff Miller, COO; and Mark McCollum, CFO. Tim Probert, president of strategy and corporate development will also be available today for follow-up calls.","I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and recent current reports on Form 8-K.","Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the fourth quarter results, which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items on our financial results unless otherwise noted.  ","We welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?","David Lesar","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone.  Let me begin by saying that our results for the first quarter played out pretty much as we said it would on our last call.  Our international operations were impacted by the normal seasonal drop off in the first quarter, but revenues and operating income expanded significantly compared to the prior year as we outgrew our primary competitors.","Sequentially, our North America margins improved substantially as we worked through the guar issue and got our equipment back to work as customers refreshed their budgets.  Total company revenue of $7 billion was a record for a Halliburton first quarter, and operating income was $902 million.  Our Sperry Drilling, Mult-Chem, and Baroid product lines achieved record revenues this quarter and from an operating income perspective, Baroid and drill bits also set new records.  ","I\u2019m very pleased with our results in North America, where we saw nearly a 400 basis point sequential improvement to our margins as we work through our remaining high-priced guar inventory, saw activity levels rebound from the dramatic drop off seen at the end of the fourth quarter, and began to see cost savings materialize from our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives.","The U.S. land rig count averaged 3% lower in the first quarter versus the prior quarter.  However, despite reduced overall rig activity, horizontal rigs were up sequentially, and we expect this trend to continue, especially in areas like the Permian Basin.  Coupled with the increased adoption of pad drilling and 24-hour operations, we expect to see even higher service intensity.  ","We believe that the oil directed rig count will grow moderately from current levels as our customers continue to evaluate the pace which they can more efficiently drill in complete wells.  We believe this continued shift towards efficiency will bode well for us in the coming years, as no other company has the ability to execute factory type operations as efficiently as Halliburton.","Recently, we have seen an uptick in natural gas prices.  However, our outlook for gas activity this year has not materially changed.  We believe we will need to see sustained pricing improvements before gas activity will meaningfully increase.  With the exception of the Marcellus, where we are already very active, our view is that natural gas drilling will not be a major activity driver in 2013 in the U.S. ","The availability of associated gas and shut in gas to meet market demand will likely delay a meaningful uptick in new well drilling.  If we see improvement in the gas basins, it will be late in the year, although we are becoming increasingly optimistic about gas activity in 2014.  ","That all being said, let me remind you that we called the fourth quarter as the bottom for North America margins, and our first quarter results bear that out.  Even with the spring breakup in Canada, we continue to expect North America margins will expand over the balance of 2013, subject to the usual year-end seasonality.   ","Turning now to the international markets, we continue to successfully execute our growth strategy.  Relative to the first quarter of 2012, we grew revenues by 21%, which is the highest among our primary peers, and is clear evidence of our expanding global market share.  ","In fact, compared to our two primary competitors, we have delivered leading year over year international growth now for the last four quarters.  In addition, eastern hemisphere grew operating income by an outstanding 39% relative to the first quarter of 2012, which is also the highest in our peer group.  ","We did experience the typical sequential decline in revenue and margins during the first quarter due to the absence of seasonally higher year-end software and product sales as well as the normal first quarter seasonal weakness in the North Sea, Eurasia, and Australia.  ","Our thinking for the full year internationally remains consistent.  We are forecasting year over year international revenue growth in the low teens, and continue to expect our average full year international margins will be in the upper teens.","In Latin America, I\u2019m happy to announce that we\u2019ve received a final award approval from Petrobras for both the high tech directional drilling and testing contracts.  These four-year contracts with extensions for up to another four years include drilling, logging while drilling, and integrated test and services in both the pre-salt and post-salt formations in the Brazilian offshore market.","In both these cases, we won the leading market position in Brazil, and more importantly, in the drilling award, we won the largest package, even though we were not the lowest bidder.  Together, the potential estimated value of these hard-fought contracts is more than $2 billion, which is expected to significantly increase our position in the largest deep water market in the world.","These wins are a testament to the ongoing success of our strategy to provide long term advanced technology solutions to our customers will increase in a leadership position in the global deep water market.  ","There\u2019s no doubt Latin America was a disappointment from a margin standpoint in the first quarter.  But the issues were one-off in nature as we saw activity delays, incurred increased severance costs in Argentina, cost to mobilize in our new deep water contracts in Brazil, and a significant rate count reduction in our Mexico IPM projects as we wait on our large contracts to retender.  I fully expect Latin America margins to improve moderately in the second quarter and to average in the upper teens for the second half of the year.  ","Our growth strategy going forward remains the same.  It is clearly working well, and does not need to be changed.  We will continue to focus on strengthening our global position in deep water, unconventionals, and mature fields, and we continue to be relentlessly focused on industry leading returns.","I am optimistic about the remainder of the year, our ability to continue rebuilding North American margins, and realizing continued revenue and margin growth in our international business.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff to provide operational highlights.  ","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone.  Let me begin with an overview of our first quarter results.  Latin America revenues grew 21% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by an expanding revenue base in Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela, and from a product line perspective, the growth was driven by Sperry Drilling, Baroid Fluids, and consulting and project management.  Year over year, operating income was down 11%, primarily due to activity delays and higher costs in Argentina and mobilization costs for the recent contract wins in Brazil.  ","In addition to the deep water Brazil wins David discussed already, we had several highlights with unconventional activity in Latin America this quarter.  In Argentina, we provided integrated completion services for an independent operator on the largest volume shale well ever pumped in the country.  This quarter also marked the first international application of PermStim, our premium guar alternative, where we designed a customer fluid treatment on a shale well in north Mexico.  ","The eastern hemisphere headline is that compared to the first quarter of 2012, revenue grew by 21% and operating income increased 39%.  And though we experienced the typical sequential decline in revenue and margin during the first quarter, we did not see the severity of weather disruption typically experienced during the first quarter.","In the Middle East Asia region, compared to prior year, revenue and operating income increased 25% and 51% respectively.  We saw the largest growth in the Australia, China, and Saudi Arabia markets.  This improved performance reflects the successful startup and execution of contract awards throughout 2012.  Specific to Saudi Arabia, we saw over 30% revenue growth relative to the first quarter of 2012, and it\u2019s expected to be one of our top growth areas in 2013.","Notably during the quarter, we received a direct award for two additional rigs on our south guar project, and we deployed the first complete rapid suite sliding sleeve system in the country.  To support further unconventional development in the region, we are look forward to opening our [unintelligible] gas technology center in Saudi Arabia later this year ","In addition, operations in Iraq posted a profitable quarter, and as we refine our portfolio of projects, we expect operations to remain profitable for the year.  Also of note, our Multi-Chem product line took a significant step forward on its eastern hemisphere footprint, expanding operations with the win in India.  ","This quarter also marked the opening of our completion technology and manufacturing center in Singapore.  The center is already delivering high quality completion tools through our eastern hemisphere operations and helping to drive additional revenue growth and cost improvements.  ","Turning to Europe, Africa, and CIS, relative to the first quarter of 2012, we saw revenue and operating income increase 17% and 25% respectively.  The improvement was driven by higher activity levels in the North Sea, Eurasia, Nigeria, and Central Africa markets.  In Angola, we recently secured a wireline formation evaluation logging contract on a deep water pre-salt block for a large independent operator and in Norway, we were awarded a multiyear contract with Statoil to improve production through multilateral solutions on a mature offshore field.","Across the Europe, Africa, and CIS region, we\u2019re seeing an uptick in the adoption of unconventional technology.  For example, we\u2019re seeing increased use of multistage fracturing across the region, and expanded application of rotary steerables and sliding sleeve technology in developing the tight oil fields of Russia.  These are markets with terrific potential for unconventional development, and we are excited about further adoption of our technologies to help clients develop their resources.","Moving to North America, revenue was down 1% compared to the previous quarter.  That\u2019s relative to a 3% sequential drop in the U.S. land rig count.  Operating income was up 30% sequentially, driven by lower water cost, increasing service intensity, and early cost savings resulting from our Frac of the Future and Battle Red initiatives.","Starting with guar, the quarter shaped up as expected, with large low-cost guar deliveries early in the quarter, significantly reducing our full quarter average cost.  Given the first quarter exit rate for completion activity, our average guar cost should be at market rate by the end of the second quarter.  At the end of the first quarter, approximately 85% of our crews were under long term contracts, and about three-quarters were working 24-hour operations.  ","At this point, I\u2019d like to say a few words on stimulation pricing.  As we finish the quarter, virtually all of our long term hydraulic fracturing contracts have been renewed.  Due to the timing of contract startups, we will see some additional pricing impact on our margins in the second quarter as some recently renegotiated contracts went into effect at the beginning of April.  However, we believe the worst of the pricing pressure is behind us.  ","To support our focus on improving pricing trends, we will continue to execute our stated strategy around surface efficiencies, custom chemistry, and subsurface technology, delivering differentiated services, which generate superior returns over the long term.  Our fleets are sold out today, and are aligned with customers where we can create the most value for them and deliver the best returns for Halliburton.  ","I believe our first quarter performance indicates we\u2019re on the right track, and as a result, I\u2019m not going to comment on any tit for tat reports on pricing because I feel they are normally self-serving and anecdotal, and I expect that you see them the same way.","With respect to our other product lines, we\u2019ve experienced some pricing pressure in specific basins, but there has not been a meaningful impact on our margins.  The pressure\u2019s been focused on cementing, [unintelligible] wireline, and directional drilling, primarily in areas with lower technology requirements and therefore smaller competitors in the market.","However, we believe that as activity levels continue to improve throughout the year, this pricing pressure will subside and our cost optimization initiatives will help offset any further pricing pressures on those service lines.  ","We\u2019re also beginning to have more meaningful discussions with our clients around the technology to make better wells, which we believe may signal the leading edge of pricing improvement.  ","We\u2019re increasingly optimistic that even in a market with flat or moderately improved rig count, we will continue to see a shift to pad well activity and more 24-hour operations.  It is our view that the resulting increased well count and stage count could absorb a meaningful percentage of the excess horsepower and help drive service intensity across the product lines.","In the Gulf of Mexico, first quarter activity was impacted by [bolt] maintenance issues on [BOP stacks].  We expect strong revenue and profit growth for the year, but weighted more to the second half.  We believe we will continue to grow our market share as rigs move to a completion cycle on new wells, and we are well-positioned to lead the market and lower tertiary completions.","A good example of how we differentiate ourselves is our enhanced single trip multizone system, which can quickly isolate and stimulate multiple zones in a lower tertiary formation, saving operators weeks of rig time and substantially improving the economics of these ultra-deep wells.  For a major operator in the Gulf, we\u2019ve already documented an average savings of 18 rig days per well by applying this single-trip technology.","I like our position in North America, and believe it\u2019s only going to get better going forward.  The guar issue is largely behind us, and we anticipate better cost optimization will result from our strategic initiatives.  We anticipate activity levels will improve through a combination of modest rig count growth and continued drilling efficiencies over the course of the year.","I want to conclude with our key areas of focus.  First, we are committed to improving our North America margins.  We\u2019ve seen a dramatic improvement this quarter, but we\u2019re not finished.  Second, we\u2019re committed to growing our international revenues and margins and achieving a better geographic balance in our business going forward.  And finally, we remain focused on capital discipline and ensuring that we generate the highest returns in our peer group.","And now Mark will provide some additional financial commentary.  Mark?  ","Mark McCollum","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone.  Our results for the first quarter reflect a $637 million net of tax accrual to increase our contingency reserve related to the Macondo multidistrict litigation.  The accrual this quarter is in addition to the $191 million net of tax accrual made in the first quarter of 2012.  ","Over the past month or so, we\u2019ve participated in court-facilitated settlement discussions with some of the parties included in the multidistrict litigation, with the goal of resolving a substantial portion of the private claims against us in this matter.  ","These discussions are at an advanced stage, although they\u2019ve not yet resulted in a settlement, and the accrual is based on where we are in the negotiations at the present time. Our most recent offering includes both stock and cash, with the cash components payable over an extended period of time.  ","We\u2019re pursuing these settlement discussions in earnest, because we believe that an early and reasonably valued resolution is in the best interest of our shareholders.  However, a settlement of this magnitude is complex, and requires the other settling parties to be reasonable on their part too.  ","From a litigation standpoint, we continue to believe that we have substantial legal arguments and defenses against any liability, and that BP is contractually required to indemnify us as described more fully in our public filings.  Therefore, if our settlement discussions are not successful, we\u2019re fully prepared to see this matter to conclusion in the courts.","As the [MBL] trial and other investigations progress, we\u2019re constantly monitoring and evaluating developments and it\u2019s possible that we may need to adjust our reserve estimate up or down in the future.  Our reserve estimate also does not include any potential recoveries from our insurers.  Because we\u2019re engaged in ongoing settlement discussions and active trial proceedings, we will not be taking any Macondo related questions today.","Excluding the charge related to the Macondo litigation, our corporate and other expense totaled $120 million this quarter and included approximately $37 million for continued investment in our Battle Red, completion tools, manufacturing, and other strategic initiatives.  Some of these initiatives will continue throughout 2013, but the related costs should begin to decline in the second half of the year.  ","We anticipate the impact of these investments will again be approximately $0.03 per share after tax in the second quarter.  Our legal costs have also increased during the Macondo trial, so in total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will average between $120 million and $130 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.","I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019re already beginning to see the payoff of the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years, such as the recent opening of the Singapore manufacturing center, a material reduction in our effective tax rate, and finally cost optimization related to our Battle Red initiative.  Next quarter, we intend to give you a further quantification of the expected savings we can realize from our Battle Red and Frac of the Future programs.","During the quarter, we were positively impacted by retroactive federal tax benefits of $50 million, resulting in an adjusted first quarter effective tax rate of approximately 23%, excluding the charge related to the Macondo litigation.  ","Due to the benefits from the strategic realignment of our international operations we completed last year, and the continued expansion of our international business, for the remaining quarters of the year, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 29%, a 300-basis point improvement over our 2012 rate.  ","Also during the quarter, we announced a 39% increase to our dividend and the commencement of stock repurchases under our existing buyback authorization of $1.7 billion.  Going forward, our intention is for the dividend to represent at least 15% to 20% of our net income.  ","As a result of the Macondo settlement discussions in the first quarter, we were unable to repurchase a significant amount of shares.  We plan, however, to be much more aggressive in our second quarter repurchase activity, following the anticipated completion of our SEC filings later this week.","Our capital expenditure guidance of approximately $3 billion for the full year 2013 remains unchanged.  For our international bus, as we move into the second quarter, we\u2019re anticipating a moderate improvement in revenue as we recover from the first quarter seasonal drop off.  And we expect margins to approach the mid teens.","For North America, we anticipate a modest improvement in the U.S. rig count in the second quarter.  However, given the stronger U.S. activity levels in the first quarter, coupled with the typical second quarter drop off in Canadian activity due to spring break up, we only expect a slight improvement in sequential revenues for the second quarter.  ","North America margins should be positively impacted by another 100 basis points or so, as our average guar cost continues to decline to market levels.  We anticipate also that marginal improvement from U.S. activity levels will be largely offset by pricing from late first quarter contract renewals and by Canadian activity disruptions due to spring breakup.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments.","David Lesar","Okay, thanks, Mark.  So in summary, we\u2019re very proud of our strong year over year international growth, which was the highest in our peer group and a solid proof point that we are executing well against our strategy.  Our overall international outlook for the year has not changed.  We expect revenues will grow in the area of the low teens, and expect full year margins will average in the upper teens.  ","Specifically, for Latin America, we had some temporary activity declines and one-off charges across the region, but it doesn\u2019t change our outlook for the full year.  The North America headwinds from last year are largely behind us, and we are optimistic about activity levels and continued margin improvement for the remainder of the year.","And lastly, with respect to ongoing Macondo settlement discussions, we are working hard to come to a reasonable settlement that will be in the best interest of our shareholders.  So at that point, let\u2019s open it up for questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Our first question comes from James West of Barclays.  Your line is now open.  ","James West - Barclays Capital","Dave, when I saw you back in January and February, there were two things that really stuck out in my mind from our conversations.  One was that on the international side you talked about the opportunity set being really the largest you\u2019d ever seen.  ","And then number two, that this was really the time to test pricing in the international markets.  I\u2019m wondering if we could kind of revisit that, if you could talk about that opportunity set.  Is it still as large as you thought a couple of months ago?  And then really the second is on the pricing side, are you starting to see some more pricing discipline from your competition?  Or are you starting to see pricing rise?   ","David Lesar ","Yeah, I think with respect to the first comment, the opportunity set in the international markets remains as large as it has been, and I think the largest set that we\u2019ve certainly seen within recent history.  So those opportunities haven\u2019t gone away.  ","I think the other point that I should make is that with the Brazil tendering process behind us, the opportunity set is a whole lot of sort of medium-sized types of opportunities.  It\u2019s not any big mega types of tenders out there.  Which gives us and our competitors, I think, an opportunity to sort of test where we are in terms of pricing.  ","If you look at where we are bidding today, and where we\u2019re winning work, I think we certainly have hit the bottom in terms of international pricing.  Believe me, it\u2019s still competitive.  But I believe that we\u2019re seeing that it is starting to turn up.","James West - Barclays Capital ","Okay, and then maybe just one follow up on Mexico.  We\u2019ve got some contract retendering that has to go through.  How long is that process expected to take before you can get back to work there?","Jeff Miller ","There are a couple of big things that happen sort of mid year.  So I would expect that through the process we\u2019ll see some sorting out of budgets early, at the end of Q1, and then tenders mid year.  It\u2019s probably later in the year, before budgets are refreshed and back to work.  But I would expect during the balance of this year we\u2019d see that.","David Lesar ","I think one other thing I might add is that on these contracts we\u2019ve gotten extensions on a number of them, but it\u2019s been at a rig count that\u2019s less than what we had been working at while we wait on these tenders to come forward.  And that\u2019s really part of the reason that the margins have got squeezed.  But as I said, we look at that as sort of a one-off issue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs.  Your line is now open.  ","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","My question relates to North America.  It seems the margin improvement was much higher than we expected.  It feels better than what you expected as well.  Could you provide, Mark, what was the source of the upward surprise in margins in the first quarter?","Mark McCollum ","As we look at it, we thought probably just given a lower level of activity expected in Q1 that we would only get a couple hundred basis points from guar savings.  I think the Street knows that we had said that we thought we could get 400 to 450 basis points of improvement in our North America margins from the turn in our guar inventories.  We, I think in the first quarter, just given the higher activity levels, got about 300 basis points of that savings on guar, which leaves the remaining 100 or so for the second quarter, which I talked about in my prepared comments.","The rest of it, really when you look at it, is activity-related.  Very strong activity for us.  We got our crews back to work much faster than we thought we would on the pressure pumping side.  When you look across our drilling and evaluation divisions, they did extremely well.  We saw almost 200 basis points of marginal improvement across D&E as well.  ","So all the activity increase for us just well exceeded the pressure that we saw from continued pricing that we had from rolling some of our pressure pumping contracts in the first quarter.   ","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs ","And this is the first time that I\u2019ve heard you guys be positive on the pricing front as well.  What gives you that confidence that pricing could pick up later in the year?","David Lesar ","The conversations that we\u2019re having with clients these days are becoming more geared towards making better wells, which leads very quickly into a discussion around chemistry and chemistry application.  And those are applications of our technology, and so maybe not today, but that\u2019s the leading edge of the right discussion to have with a company like Halliburton, because we do make better wells when we use that technology.  ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering.  Your line is now open.  ","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.  ","","The reported rig counts, we can see activity has trended pretty flattish over the last month in the U.S.  Just wanted to hear kind of your discussion, your viewpoint, on activity second and third quarter, and what gives you confidence there will be uptick from here?","David Lesar ","A combination of things.  We see increases in pad drilling.  That obviously drives service intensity for us.  You heard my discussion around leading edge of technology application.  And those things combined start to take us to more efficient operations where we\u2019re using our equipment.  ","The second thing is really alignment with the clients that appreciate our efficiency level.  And so as we position our equipment in the basins and with the clients that want that sort of efficiency, we expect to see improvement.  So in spite of, say, rig count modestly increasing, both our share of it and the speed with which that activity happens can increase.  ","Jeff Miller ","When you look at the well count, yeah, overall it didn\u2019t look that great, but the horizontal rig count was up.  If you look inside of that, the rig count went up with the customers whom we work for.  A lot of the majors.  ","And then thirdly, we focus more dramatically on well count.  And when we look at activity across the quarter, well count was up and so was our service intensity around stage counts.  And so that drives improved performance, as Jeff said, when you\u2019re aligned with the right customers doing the right type of work with good technology.  ","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.  ","And my second question is just as you look out, if you think about exiting this year, North American margins were quite a bit better than I had thought.  We\u2019re going to see international margin improve during the course of the year.  I would still expect international margins to exceed North America to exit the year.  Do you agree with that?","Jeff Miller ","No, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily agree with that.  I think it will be a horse race as the year progresses.  Certainly North America is getting better, but we\u2019ve still got excess capacity in the North America market that we\u2019ll be dealing with, so there is some pricing pressure that they\u2019re facing.  Right now, as the international operations expand and on their base and the improvement that we see, I think that they could actually eclipse the North America margin in the year.  But it will be very, very close.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS.  Your line is now open.  ","Angeline Sedita - UBS","","Just to be clear, when you\u2019re talking about North America and modest price increases as customers adopt new technology.  Is this specifically in frac?  Or in other product lines?","David Lesar ","This is all product lines.  So this is about making better wells, which is a function of well construction and completions.  But I will say these are the leading edge of discussions around how to do it.  So very encouraged by the discussions, which means there\u2019s an appreciation for the technology of how better producing wells are made.","Angeline Sedita - UBS ","And then on North American frac capacity, assuming that we do see another 6-7% growth in the rig count in 2013, and as we\u2019ve discussed here, growth in the well count and, i.e., rig efficiencies, do you believe that the frac market could actually be balanced by early 2014 or even late 2013?  ","David Lesar ","Really Q1 played out very close to what we thought it would, maybe a little bit better activity.  We always thought, as we looked ahead, that there still would be some excess capacity in the frac market, maybe in the 10-15% level, too much frac capacity.  That could get absorbed very, very quickly in the early part of 2014 based on what we\u2019re seeing.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Co.  Your line is now open.   ","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.","","Back to North America here real quickly.  You guys have addressed this in some facets, but not necessarily in others.  I guess my question is you came into the year with a decent inventory [of drill bit], uncompleted wells.  That helped propel better completions activity versus drilling activity in Q1.  Drilling activity hasn\u2019t been all that brisk year to date.  And yet you guys are waxing confident about the runway remaining for the next quarter or so.  At least that\u2019s my interpretation.  Can you give us some more granularity as to which markets look better?  Which markets look worse?  And specific discussions you\u2019re having with customers?  Because it sounds like the visibility you see is more nebulous to the market.   ","David Lesar ","Let me take this one.  I think it\u2019s not a matter of geography.  It really is a matter of your customer base.  And we\u2019ve said for years we only deal with what we call the fair way players in the U.S., North America market.  These are the folks that are going to keep rigs up and their budgets up, through thick and thin, but also are those that are dealing with some of the lowest lease cost opportunities there.  ","So we pride ourselves on our ability to sort of pick and choose who we work for, and we do that.  And so it really doesn\u2019t matter where they\u2019re working.  And I really wouldn\u2019t get too concentrated and focused on geography.  It\u2019s really what our customer base is.  And I think has Mark has said, our customers that we\u2019re working for are increasing their rig counts.  They\u2019re increasing their budgets, and we sort of know what their plans are for the remainder of this year.  ","And that\u2019s what gives us the increasing confidence of our position in North America from a margin accretion standpoint, notwithstanding the fact that there are a lot of other companies and customers out there that may not feel so confident.  We just happen to feel really strong and really confident about the customer base that we have.  ","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.  ","And then the follow up is on international.  Your guidance sort of low teens for the year.  You\u2019ve got a 21% year over year increase for the first quarter in terms of revenue growth, which implies a pretty good slowdown with year over year growth relative to Q1 for the balance of the year.  Is that conservatism?  Or is that based upon conviction that the year over year rate of growth is actually going to slow that much?  It\u2019s still commendable, but slower than Q1.","David Lesar ","It is truly slower than Q1, but I think that as we look year over year, Q1 in 2012 was a bit more dramatically down.  And so we knew that Q1 probably would be a little bit higher percentage.  As we look ahead also we think that particularly in Latin America things are going to move a little bit slower, possibly, than some would forecast.  So maybe it has a little bit of conservatism in it, but we think it\u2019s a pretty fair forecast, just based on, historically, what you see customers do from this point forward.  And remember, last year we saw some pretty significant growth sequentially in our international markets coming off of Q1.  So it really is in comparison to last year.  ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC.  Your line is now open.  ","Kurt Hallead - RBC","Dave, a question for you.  There was a lot of chatter the last couple of days, at least from one of your competitors, getting very optimistic about the acceleration in the international marketplace as you get through the second half of the year.  And I think a lot of that is being driven by the prospects of the Saudis to pick up rigs.  I know you\u2019re pretty close to the situation out there, very close.  I wonder if you can put it into context for us compared to what transpired in Saudi in \u201806\/\u201907 into \u201908, how you would compare that to what you see happening now, and then what kind of impact you would expect that to have on capacity and pricing and opportunities going out late \u201913 and into \u201914?","David Lesar ","Well, I think, sort of on a broad scale, as I indicated before, we are very excited about the potential in the eastern hemisphere markets at this point in time.  And we are very optimistic, specifically, about opportunities in Saudi Arabia.  If you look at the myriad of areas that Aramco was looking at increasing: gas drilling, work over areas, the whole area of lump sum turnkey projects.  And we\u2019re embedded with Aramco in all of those.  ","So I think if you look at the opportunities in the Red Sea, where we recently won some work with Saudi Aramco.  So we\u2019re very excited about that market in particular, and obviously we\u2019ll get more than our share of that market as it comes around.  We\u2019re in active negotiations with them right now about several projects.  Obviously, we can\u2019t talk about them until they\u2019re awarded, but we\u2019re very optimistic about where we stand on them.  ","So I believe that Saudi is a bit of a microcosm of what we see the whole international market playing out as, which is very positive over the next several years.  ","Kurt Hallead - RBC ","And maybe in that context, is there a parallel we can draw to what transpired in \u201906, \u201907 and the acceleration in bus and margins and activity and pricing and everything else that drove the sector for a good two, two and a half year period?","David Lesar ","I certainly hope so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse.  Your line is now open.  ","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Jeff, you talk about service intensity.  And we all know that rig count is becoming increasingly pass\u00e9 as a metric.  And I understand the improvements in technology in your customer base that drive your business.  But have you all come up with a number?  Is service intensity growing by 5%?  10%? Is there a number that you all are kind of looking to put on that?  ","David Lesar ","We look at different metrics, so numbers of stages and different things that we see out there.  And so when we look at it, we see it improving.  I\u2019m not going to give you, necessarily, a particular metric, but we\u2019re forecasting a 9-10% improvement in efficiency of rigs, which gets to what drives the underlying numbers of stages, numbers of activity.  ","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse ","And I know we talked a little bit about rig count and all, but spending.  Do you think that North America spending will go up this year, through the rest of the year?  There\u2019s been a great deal of question as to whether the rig count is going to move.  And like I said, rig count doesn\u2019t matter.  And the number of sources we have for footage and wells are kind of sparse.  What do you think spending is going to do for the industry overall for North America for the rest of the year?","David Lesar ","I think the actual spending is probably going to be flat, and I think that\u2019s a function of spending the money faster, which our clients will be able to do.  So I don\u2019t see a big increase in actual spend, necessarily, across the board.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein.  Your line is now open.  ","","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein","We\u2019ve seen Halliburton definitely take the lead here in pushing for more 24-hour work and pumping in the states.  It\u2019s obviously great for asset turns and margins.  But you can also complete more stages when you work around the clock.  Have you guys gone out and looked at the efficiency gain which is being realized by your pumping fleet, or maybe the pumping fleet as a whole here in the U.S., and how that will impact tightening of the market?","David Lesar ","You know, our strategy has been to implement our Q10 pump capability.  We\u2019ve [feathered] that end of the market, sort of ratably, as we\u2019ve retired equipment.  But we believe we will see probably a 20% improvement in our efficiency on the back of our technology.  So when I think about capital efficiency and capital required to address our piece of the market, I believe it will be more competitive than others, certainly in that space.","Jeff Miller  ","","Let me just add one more comment.  Obviously the impact of 24-hour operations adds to the efficiency of the industry, but it also eats up your equipment two or three times faster than your traditional way of doing pressure pumping does.  So that in itself also will lend to the consumption of any excess capacity that\u2019s in the market, just because the useful life of your equipment tends to require you to have more maintenance and more ongoing cost.  But it does grind the equipment up faster and that tends to take some of the equipment out of the market a lot faster than it might historically have.","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein ","And that 20% figure, that\u2019s primarily related to less backup capacity?  Or is that a combination of less backup capacity and more stages executed per week, per month?","Jeff Miller ","That\u2019s, actually, in our view, the same thing, stages less horsepower.","David Lesar ","The Q10 runs at higher rate of horsepower than traditional pumps and so if you just look through it, you just need 20% less, based on what we\u2019re seeing it run in the marketplace.  It means fewer trucks.","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein ","If I could ask a quick question on Mexico.  You mentioned a little bit slower going here in terms of growth rate in Latin America.  What\u2019s your outlook for gas-related activity in Mexico, particularly in the Burgos.  You know, Mexico is importing more low-cost gas here from the U.S.","David Lesar ","I think it\u2019s still a bit of a science experiment in northern Mexico right now.  As we\u2019ve talked about over the last couple of calls, we\u2019ve done some fracs.  I think we did the first frac in northern Mexico.  And the results have not been made public on that.  So we won\u2019t do that today.  But I think you can consider it as sort of a prospective science experiment at this point in time.  But we are optimistic about what might develop as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.  Your line is now open.   ","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Everyone seems to be downplaying the potential improvement in natural gas activity.  You did on this call as well.  [unintelligible] price has been down about $4 for over a month, and I\u2019m just kind of wondering, some of your [competitors] are starting to lock in hedges.  Why won\u2019t we start to see activity increasing soon.  You talk about your customer base.  You stuck with those guys.  I\u2019m just kind of curious what they\u2019re saying.  What do they need to see to start getting out there again.","David Lesar ","I think you\u2019re right.  For $4 plus gas, where they can lock hedges in, is getting to the point where a lot of these fair way players actually can be quite profitable from a return standpoint on these.  I think what we want to convey today is that we\u2019re not counting on that in the projection we\u2019re doing of where we see the market going the balance of the year.  Obviously if gas prices do stay in the above-$4 level, I think that only adds to the potential optimism that we have about 2013 and 2014.","David Anderson - JPMorgan ","That number could really change in the second half of the year if it stays here and if your customers start coming back.  We should see even more [upset] to your margins.","David Lesar ","Yes, that would be our feeling, for sure.","David Anderson - JPMorgan ","We often hear your competitors complain about your pricing.  It also seems a bit like sour grapes considering you guys have a lower cost structure out there.  I was wondering if you could just give us a sense as to how much lower you think your costs are compared to your competitors?  And also, how far along are you in the Battle Red initiative and some of these other cost initiatives?","David Lesar ","We\u2019re not going to comment from a competitive standpoint on where we think we are relative to cost.  I think we\u2019re making progress on the two initiatives you describe, Frac of the Future and Battle Red.  We\u2019ll plan to give you a better update on that next quarter.  But they do drive efficiency for us in the ability to obviously manage our bus.  As I said in my prepared comments, I don\u2019t plan to comment on the tit for tat, back and forth around pricing, just because it\u2019s anecdotal.  Our commitment is to make a return on the equipment we put in the market and that\u2019s my commitment.  And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies.  Your line is now open.  ","Brad Handler - Jefferies","I guess I\u2019ll stay with North America too to start.  And this is a bit of a leading question.  If you are as committed as you are, and you have a process where the Q10 pump is rolling out, in principal you cannot retire the older pumps as aggressively and build into an opportunity to work with these good customers of yours that might be growing their bus.  Is there any change in philosophy, I suppose, about the retirement strategy of your existing equipment?","David Lesar ","No.  I mean, the new technology is more efficient.  It also has better maintenance cycles.  So it\u2019s the right thing to do.  And so what we plan to do is continue with what we had said in terms of capital discipline throughout the year.  And at this point in the year, we\u2019re well into the year.","Brad Handler - Jefferies ","I appreciate your spending wouldn\u2019t change.  I just don\u2019t know if the retirement intentions might have softened perhaps?  I guess just to clarify the question.","Jeff Miller ","I think the way that I would characterize it, from the earlier question, if gas activity were to take off dramatically on us, and we recognized that we weren\u2019t putting enough, it would be easier to dial up our manufacturing just a little bit to get more Q10s out.  We\u2019ve been trying to be very disciplined in how the Q10s are coming out.  We\u2019ve talked about reducing capex, staying with it, and generating some additional cash flow this year.  That\u2019s an adjustment that we can make if we felt like the forecast could lend itself to basically turn out more units rather than keeping the old stuff out of the field and deferring those efficiency gains that we\u2019re trying to capture.","Brad Handler - Jefferies ","If I could ask an unrelated one on Brazil, so the contracts have been signed.  Help us a little bit with the ramp, the incremental revenue ramp.  Does that take several quarters?  Should we see full run rates only in 2014?  Or does that happen relatively more quickly?","David Lesar ","I would say to look more to 2014 for the full ramp on that.  We will feather equipment in as we sort of go through the year.  But don\u2019t expect full on, really, until the equipment\u2019s in place and ready to go.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen Securities.  Your line is now open.  ","Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities","Given your somewhat optimistic view on gas drilling for 2014, and given the lead times involved, are you close to the point, or are you almost at the point, where you might consider new equipment building in domestic pressure pumping?","David Lesar ","I think that\u2019s one of the huge advantages we have by manufacturing our own pumping equipment, is we don\u2019t have the real extended lead times that our competitors might have with respect to when they order up and can dial up their spend there.  So I think we really have the luxury of waiting until probably the second and third quarter of this year to take a look at the market before we have to make a decision as to whether or not we want to ramp up production that could come on stream in 2014.  And I think that\u2019s part of the reason that we have the higher returns, is that we have more granularity around our ability to control manufacturing.","Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities ","For follow up, my question is on the formation evaluation, both LWD and wireline bus worldwide.  If you just exclude Brazil for a second, I know that increasing penetration in this market has been key to your overall goal of improving margins internationally.  Can you comment, and maybe even include the deep water Gulf of Mexico?  Do you feel in both LWD and wireline you\u2019ve gained share of the market in the past year?","David Lesar ","Yeah, I think in the last year we have gained some share.  And I think it\u2019s demonstrated by some of the markets where we\u2019re working today.  So with our sort of full [FE] suite of services, we\u2019re working in east Africa today and some of the more challenging environments there.  We\u2019re seeing, as I mentioned, progress in Angola.  We\u2019ve won some important contracts [unintelligible] to work in Asia.  So yes, we\u2019re making the progress that I would expect and partly just demonstrating our capability to deliver in these deep water markets.","Kelly Youngblood","I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Your line is now open.  ","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Dave, I was hoping to get your last thoughts on Halliburton\u2019s exposure to the artificial lift market.  You have a clear focus on mature fields.  And particularly just in light of GE\u2019s announced acquisition of Lufkin.  ","David Lesar ","If you look at our portfolio, artificial lift is one that clearly was a hole in the portfolio that we have.  We made the acquisition a year ago of Global, and now have an offering in artificial lift.  It actually, I think, as we said in either the Q3 or Q4 call last year, has exceeded beyond our wildest imagination in terms of financial performance.  And it sort of gives us a window into what the opportunities in that market will be.  ","So we\u2019re glad to be in the business, albeit in a small way right now, but I think that what we\u2019ve demonstrated over the years is that when we get focused on a market and put the capital to it, that we basically are going to be a player.  ","Now, [unintelligible] is going to be basically in [ESP].  At this point in time, rod lift and things like that we don\u2019t view as critical to our ability to compete long run in the mature field area.  But I think that having the ESP offering is something that rounds out what we have and was an important acquisition for us to build on.  ","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And Mark, what\u2019s the potential for significantly accelerating the share repurchase program, particularly if a significant portion of the Macondo settlement is paid in stock?  Does that alter the thinking?","Mark McCollum ","Certainly a settlement on Macondo gives us more certainty as to what we could do with our cash going forward.  I think everyone recognizes we\u2019ve had a cash placeholder on the balance sheet as it were to hold in anticipation of what the ultimately exposure on Macondo might be.  ","I think having an earlier resolution of it, if we are successful in settlement discussions, would give us some certainty, then, as to what we could do.  We typically need $750 to $800 million of cash to run the business.  And beyond that, everything else creates an opportunity.  And so I think you hit it right.  If something were to happen, that would create a lot of opportunity for us to do some interesting things.  ","Operator","Thank you.  And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.  ","Kelly Youngblood","No, operator, you can go ahead and close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Sir you may begin.","Kelly Youngblood","Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2015 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days.","Joining me today are Jeff Miller, President; Christian Garcia, Acting CFO; and Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer. As mentioned on our last call, due to a longstanding business commitment, Dave Lesar, Halliburton's Chairman and CEO will not be present today but will return for our second quarter call. Today Jeff will be providing market commentary, followed by Christian who will discuss our quarterly financial results and finally, Mark will provide an update on our progress relating to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. ","Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events.

We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.","Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which can be found on our website. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. ","Jeff Miller","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning everyone. It was a challenging quarter for the service industry which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodity prices. For Halliburton, total company revenue of $7.1 billion was a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 relative to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count, once again representing industry-leading revenue performance. ","Operating income declined 28% year-over-year to approximately $700 million, driven by North America and Europe\/Africa\/CIS. The industry experienced unprecedented decline in the North America drilling activity during the first quarter which significantly impacted our financial results. US rig count has dropped approximately 50% from the peak in late November and we\u2019re still seeing activity fall off week to week although the pace of decline has slowed. ","Looking back over the last several major cycles, the speed of this downturn has been historically high. Because of the lack of available work driven by the rig count decline and the resulting overcapacity and available equipment chasing the work that remains, this is an extremely competitive market. We\u2019re seeing substantial pricing pressure in all of our product lines and the significant amount of service capacity is looking for work. ","Service company behavior has fallen really into one of three buckets. First, those who are still running their businesses to make a profit and returns for their investors. Second, those who have decided that covering fixed cost is no longer important and therefore will take work to keep equipment busy and crews intact while operating at a loss. And third, those who are basically working at a price which covers only their cash costs. Ultimately neither model 2 or 3 is sustainable. And we believe capacity adjustments are likely in a market like this. ","We\u2019re not going to call a bottom but historically it's taken rig count three quarters to move from peak to trough. Once we see activity stabilized, the healing process can begin but it takes time. Our input costs can then start to catch up with service pricing declines and our efficiency programs and well solutions can start driving margins upwards. ","What is not unique about this downturn is the customer service company and supplier behavior is pretty much as you would expect. What is unique is the speed at which this is happening. We believe that the operators, vendors and service companies who deal most effectively with the velocity of this downturn will be those who profit the most when it turns. We fully expect Halliburton to be one of those winners and so will the vendors who work with us to get through it. ","Outside of North America, the international markets were more resilient than the domestic market but were not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. The international rig count is down 9% from the peak last July but we\u2019re seeing customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the lower cash flows available to operators, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs and are asking the oil service companies, engineering companies and fabricators to offer solutions, including pricing concessions. We\u2019re working with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. ","As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions this year with full year international spending reflecting a mid-teens reduction. We still expect Middle East\/Asia to be the most stable region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait are anticipated to move forward. However we expect Malaysia, Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. ","Europe\/Africa\/CIS is experiencing significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In particular, the offshore markets are facing extremely challenging economics. We've already seen significant delays of exploration work in these markets with a number of pending opportunities still at risk as operators work to balance their budgets. And in Latin America, we expect lower activity levels across the region with the largest declines projected in Mexico as a result of budget constraints and Colombia where operators are sizing their programs to live within cash flows. ","In addition, we anticipate lower revenue resulting from the new Venezuelan exchange rate. Given the near-term headwinds that we\u2019re seeing globally, our focus is on controlling what's within our control. First, after taking a hard look at our global operations in the first quarter, we streamlined our business primarily through headcount and asset reductions while not impacting our service delivery model, which resulted in a $1.2 billion restructuring charge, including a complete write-off of our operations in both Libya and Yemen. Christian will provide more details later in the call. ","Second, we\u2019re continuing to work with our suppliers. As we discussed last quarter, there's a delay in realizing cost savings from our suppliers. Input cost reductions around items like sand and logistics began during the first quarter and we expect to realize more of these cost savings as we move through the remainder of the year. We\u2019re pleased that many of our key vendors now realize the type of market that we are in and they are working with us to allow us to get our input costs more competitive. We\u2019re also looking at consolidating our vendor list into fewer companies that we can commit more volume to going forward. ","Third, we are staying focused on service execution and collaborating with our customers to reduce their well costs. Fourth, we're playing offense. We're focused on the utilization of our deployed assets and we're defending our market share with key customers. And finally and most importantly, we're still a returns driven organization and where pricing concessions were to push returns below an acceptable threshold, we have instead elected to stack equipment, including frac lease. Given the unsustainable prices, we've seen some of our competition willing to work for them who would rather save our equipment for better times. ","One other thing I need to point out is that in a typical downturn we would've reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done but in anticipation of closing the Baker Hughes acquisition later this year, we want to preserve our underlying service delivery platform. We know we have best-in-class service delivery and keeping this platform in peak condition will allow us to realize our transaction synergies post close. This means that we're not cutting as deep as we might have done so otherwise. And consequently we're carrying an elevated cost structure. While this decision burdens current margins it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run. ","As we\u2019ve done in previous downturns, we are looking through the cycle and investing capital and strategic programs to maintain the health of the franchise and to position ourselves to be able to accelerate out of the downturn when the market recovers. This includes investing in key technologies and capabilities that allow us to deliver our value proposition in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. ","As I mentioned previously, we're always working closely with customers around the world to help them lower their cost per barrel of oil equivalent. We approach this in two ways. First through more efficient and more reliable lower-cost delivery platform, and second, through technology that reduces uncertainty and makes better wells. ","In terms of efficiency this is where innovations like our Frac of the Future with its increased reliability and lower-cost profile become important differentiators. Our Q-10 pumps support our surface efficiency strategy which will enable us to lower operators\u2019 costs while at the same time protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. This is also where we leverage the scale of our global logistics network and supply chain. ","Just as important, we\u2019re working with our customers to help them make better wells through subsurface insight and custom chemistry. Our CoreVault system is a great example of delivering subsurface insight where we\u2019re able to collect multiple core samples during a single trip and preserve 100% of the downhole fluid for analysis. This accelerates our customers\u2019 reservoir understanding, more precisely locate hydrocarbons and helps them fully understand the economic value of their asset. We\u2019re doing this today in every North American basin and have recently expanded into Europe and Asia-Pacific. ","Our CYPHER seismic to stimulation service is gaining traction, helping more customers maximize the value of their unconventional assets. Our CYPHER project count actually increased sequentially even as activity levels declined. The added projects included both existing customers expanding their programs as well as customers new to the CYPHER platform. ","And finally, custom chemistry where we are pleased with the expansion of AccessFrac which helps our customers efficiently and effectively stimulate the entire lateral. In addition to being used in 12 basins around the world, AccessFrac is also seeing significant uptick as a refrac solution in North America. When deploying our proprietary chemical diversion technology in the early unconventional oil wells, we\u2019ve seen instances where the estimated ultimate recovery has more than doubled. ","There has been a lot of discussion around inventory wells. Operators choosing to drill but not complete wells and then defer production until commodity prices become more favorable. Third-party estimates put this number around 4000 wells. It is our view that although inventory wells can exacerbate the short-term activity declines per completions, it essentially defers the revenue opportunity. When our customers decide to increase activity levels, this will be beneficial for Halliburton as they are likely to increase completions in tandem with new well drilling, which could accelerate our rate of recovery during the upcycle. ","Now before I turn the call over to Christian, I want to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. Over the past several months, global demand expectations for 2015 have been consistently revised higher, now calling for an increase of over 1 million barrels per day, including recent upward revisions for both US and Europe. ","On the supply side, we\u2019re all watching US production levels very closely given the volume expansions that took place throughout 2013 and 2014. Recently monthly production estimates have been encouraging, however, showing significantly lower production growth and actually projecting oil production to be flat to down in the major basins. ","In terms of international production, non-OPEC estimates continue to be trimmed. But we see this as an overlooked positive factor. Comparing the IEA forecast exit rate for 2015 against 2014, key non-OPEC contributors are expected to decline with further reduction expected as a result of declining global rig count. We view this as ultimately constructive for the prospect of supply-demand equilibrium. Whether we reach this point in months or quarters, Halliburton will continue to take the necessary steps to prepare our global franchise with the eventual recovery and to outperform our competitors. ","Further it's our view that North America will continue to be the most adaptable market in terms of addressing well economics through both efficiency models and technology uptake. One way to look at it is that the US unconventional business is now the lowest cost fast as the market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today. One thing we\u2019ve helped our unconventional customers prove over the years is that they are smart, technically savvy and very adaptable companies and I am confident that this type of market will show that again. As a result, we believe that when the recovery does come, North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way. ","We\u2019ve been through these cycles before. We know what to do and we\u2019ll execute on that experience. ","Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?","Christian Garcia","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. I will begin with an overview of our first-quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.1 billion represented a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 while operating income declined 28% to approximately $700 million. ","As expected, we experienced typical first quarter sequential decline in revenue and margins due to the absence of high year-end software and product sales in the fourth quarter, as well as the normal first-quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and the Bakken. The decline this year was obviously exacerbated by the macro headwinds facing the industry. ","Now let me compare our geographic results to the first quarter of 2014. In the Eastern Hemisphere, first-quarter revenue was essentially flat and operating income increased 3% over prior year despite activity and pricing headwinds. We\u2019ve consistently outperformed our competitors in terms of revenue growth over the last few years and we expect that this will be true for the first quarter once all of our peers have reported. ","In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 13% and 33% respectively. This excellent improvement was led by solid growth in integrated project activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and India that was partially offset by declines in Malaysia and Australia. ","Turning to Europe\/Africa\/ CIS, we saw first quarter revenue and operating income declined 16% and 41% respectively. Significant activity declines in Angola and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea along with currency and sanction related issues in Russia led to the lower results for the region. ","Latin America revenue and operating income increased by 10% and 22% respectively, primarily due to higher unconventional drilling in Argentina and increased activity in Venezuela. ","Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 9% and 54% respectively, relative to a 21% reduction in the US-land rig count. Lower commodity prices have translated into severe reductions in activity levels throughout the first quarter accompanied by significant price reductions. Primarily as a result of the market decline that is affecting all of our operations globally, we incurred $1.2 billion of charges in the first quarter consisting of asset write-offs, including our entire operations in Libya and Yemen, severance-related costs, inventory write-downs, impairments of intangible assets and facility closures and other items. ","Over the last two quarters, we\u2019ve reduced our headcount by approximately 9000 employees, more than 10% of our global headcount. As Jeff indicated, we're continuing to take a hard look at our operations. Additional actions will likely be required in the second quarter although we expect further charges will be significantly smaller. ","Our corporate and other expenses totaled $69 million for the quarter, slightly lower than originally anticipated. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $75 million and this will be the new quarterly run rate for 2015. ","During the quarter, we adopted the new free-floating market exchange rate in Venezuela, resulting in an approximate $200 million foreign-currency loss. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 26% due to a higher mix of international earnings and other favorable tax benefits. For the second quarter we\u2019re expecting the effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%. ","For capital expenditures, given the severity of the decline in activity levels, we are now reducing our capital spend for the year by $500 million or approximately 15% to $2.8 billion. Because we manufacture our owned equipment, we have the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market. ","Our objective is to look beyond the cycle and we continue to be committed to investing in certain strategic technologies such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older more costly equipment. Our rollout strategy related to this initiative is not impacted as a result of our new capital guidance and therefore we still expect to be approximately 50% converted to the Frac of the Future by year-end. ","Finally, let me give you some comments on our second-quarter operational outlook. In North America, the average US rig count for the second quarter is already down nearly 30% compared to the first quarter and we expect further activity declines and for pricing to remain under pressure. As a result, we anticipate a sequential revenue decline in the second quarter. But as a reminder, we typically outpace changes in the average rig count. ","We also expect margins to drift lower to the mid single digits with our sequential decrementals improving compared to the first quarter as we begin to see the impact of our cost reduction initiatives and lower input costs from our suppliers. ","Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. In the second quarter, we are anticipating both revenue and margins to be in line with the first-quarter levels, as the typical seasonal improvements are expected to be offset by customer budget reductions and pricing concessions. ","In Latin America, for the second quarter we expect a revenue decline in the upper teens with low double-digit margins. The main driver of this is our Venezuela operations where revenues are expected to decline by 50% sequentially as a result of the recent currency devaluation. In addition, we expect to see budget constraints in Mexico and reduced activity in Brazil and Colombia. ","Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the pending Baker acquisition. Mark?","Mark McCollum","Thanks, Christian and good morning. It\u2019s good to be back on the call and I am excited to be able to provide you with an update on the significant progress we\u2019re making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition. ","Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. On March 27, we announced that the transaction was approved by the shareholders of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes. We were pleased that nearly 99% of the shares voted at Halliburton Special Meeting voted in favor of the proposal and that more than 98% of the shares voted at Baker Hughes special meeting voted in favor of the transaction. These results were strong vote of confidence from our shareholders and we believe reflect their enthusiasm for the strategic and financial merits of the combination. When we announced the transaction last November, we discussed the likelihood of divestitures and our confidence that the combination would be achievable from a regulatory standpoint. ","On April 7, we announced that we will be marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, logging while drilling and measurement while drilling businesses. The 2014 revenue associated with these businesses was approximately $3.5 billion. We're very pleased with the strong interest that\u2019s been expressed in these assets by potential buyers both within the energy industry as well as outside the industry, including a number of very capable financial sponsors. We will begin the marketing process in the coming weeks. The eventual sale of these businesses is subject to obtaining final approval of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition by the competition authorities reviewing the transaction. ","We expect there will likely be additional divestitures and we plan to provide updates at the appropriate time. However launching the sale of the drill bits and drilling businesses is a good first step toward expediting this process. We're continuing to respond to the second information request from the Department of Justice and outside of the US we continue to make progress with the required filings with the competition authorities in foreign jurisdictions. We believe we remain on track to complete the transaction late in the second half of 2015. ","Now turning to integration planning. Since launching the process in early December, we\u2019ve been focused on developing a comprehensive, detailed and thoughtful integration plan to make the post-closing transition as seamless, efficient and productive as possible but also to fully capture the financial and strategic benefits of the combination. Working in parallel with the Baker Hughes integration team, we're bringing together the talent and expertise of both companies to build an even stronger combined organization as well as ensure that the planning efforts results in a robust integration plan for each and every functional and operational area of both businesses. ","We\u2019re preparing such that on day one after the close, we can immediately begin the integration and start capturing the value inherent in this combination and deliver on the estimated synergies. Regardless of market conditions and the actions both we and Baker Hughes have taken to date, we continue to target annual pre-tax cost synergies of nearly $2 billion. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident that we can achieve our synergy objective. ","In closing, we remain enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We\u2019re very excited about the benefits this combination will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination will create a bellwether global oilfield services company and together with Baker Hughes we will combine our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of solutions to our customers. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks. ","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Mark. To sum it up, I want to thank the Halliburton team for avoiding distractions and maintaining their focus during the downturn. We\u2019re excited about the pending Baker acquisition. We\u2019re making great progress and believe we\u2019re on track to close late in the second half of this year. ","It's a tough market out there and we\u2019re not going to try to call a recovery. There are just not enough convincing data points out there at this time for me to make a conclusion. Instead we\u2019re focused on the things we can control, things like rightsizing the business to current activity levels, preparing for the Baker integration by preserving our service delivery platform, collaborating with our customers to address their well costs, protecting market share with key customers, to turning down work when baseline economic thresholds don't make sense. Continuing to work with our supply chain to properly adjust costs to current market conditions, we made progress here but there's still more to get. And finally investing to preserve the long-term value of the franchise. ","So whatever scenario you think may happen, we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market. We demonstrated this during previous cycles and have no reason to believe that this cycle will be any different. ","Now let\u2019s open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. ","Jud Bailey ","Good job on the quarter, impressive. A question on international, impressive performance in the margins better than what we were anticipating and as well as the second quarter guide. Could you give us a little insight, Jeff, as to what\u2019s helping drive the margin performance there and help us think about going forward, are you seeing the impact of some of the pricing concessions in the 1 and 2Q margins internationally?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Jud. I am pleased as well with the results in the international market for us and I think it reflects a systematic buildout that we have been talking about in terms of strengthening that organization and it's really paying off. It also demonstrates execution of our mature field strategy which is really inherent in a lot of that activity. So I think it's consistent with our performance over the last couple of years and I expect to continue to outperform there. As we look at pricing, though, there is pricing pressures sort of throughout the marketplace and obviously the international markets are not immune to that. ","Jud Bailey ","And then my follow-up is going to be on North America. You obviously comment on the second quarter for margins but can you help us think a little bit further maybe in the back half of the year? You noted in the release, you\u2019re going to carry higher costs as you anticipate closing of the Baker transaction. Can you help us think about the impact on margins, maybe in the back half of the year as you carry higher cost than you would've anticipated against the market dynamics as price is going to be pretty tough in the back half of the year?","Christian Garcia","Jud, this is Christian. Let me take that. So you have two questions, one is what happens to North America margins in the second half of the year. We\u2019re not going to provide guidance as Jeff talked about in his prepared remarks, the healing process starts when activity stabilizes and then pricing stabilizes, and then we will see the benefits of the adjustments in cost structure that we have taken. So don't know what it is but really it\u2019s a guess on when activity stabilizes. ","In terms of the service delivery platform, the costs that we are keeping in anticipation of the Baker acquisition, first of all, those costs that we are keeping are global in nature but it is certainly more impactful to North America. There are several examples of those buckets of costs. One is our footprint. We operate in about 20 districts in North America and with that type of downturn that we\u2019re seeing \u2013 as severe as we are seeing, we would consider consolidating some of them. ","The other one is management of organizations. So we have a management layer between the districts and the areas. We would probably have considered collapsing them. And the third, as you know we've been building our logistics capability in the last few years, sand plants where we have transloading facilities in all of the basins, or rail car network, we would have probably dismantled portions of it as activity declined. However we are keeping all of those because we're expecting the increased volumes from Baker and in terms of the margin impact of this, I can say it would probably range between 200 to 300 basis points. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS.","Angie Sedita ","Congrats on a good quarter. Mark, I thought it was impressive, your comments on the Baker deal as far as the $2 billion in synergies. I would have thought with the pressure on revenues that the $2 billion in synergies could have moved a bit but can you talk about that a little bit as well as the accretion timeline? Has that changed at all in your mind?","Mark McCollum","So I will address the last question first, Angie. The accretion timeline hasn\u2019t adjusted. Obviously everything is contingent on us getting the transaction closed. We can\u2019t get after any of the integration actions until the closing happens. But I think to address your first question, there are couple things to note. First of all, we continue to target internally as synergy cases beyond the two, I mean in order to achieve it, you\u2019ve got to reach high and so we're looking at every single thing that we could go after. That's why we remain confident. ","In the downturn itself, certainly there are actions that are being taken both by Halliburton and Baker Hughes that impact employee counts, facility closures and lot of other things, some of which you would say likely would be something that would be in the synergy case itself. But the differences is that most of these changes are being done in response to the market downturn, and the question ultimately comes to, okay, when the market comes back, what happens to those costs, in order for the synergy case to be ultimately captured, we\u2019ve got to make process changes, procedural changes, changes in the way that we do business between the two companies that ultimately captures those synergies, so that when the business does come back, the cost associated with those activities does not. And so that\u2019s why the plans that we are making on the integration continue to really drive after the fundamental process and procedural changes behind it to make sure that we secure those synergies, not just for the current period but forever. ","Angie Sedita ","And then along with that as far as the follow up, the cash from the asset sales related to the merger, is the first priority still buying back stock or has that priority changed?","Christian Garcia","Really nothing has changed, Angie. The magnitude of the buyback will always be dependent on how much cash we generate during this downturn, the proceeds from the divestitures and so forth. But our priority has not changed. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citi. ","Scott Gruber ","There has been a lot of discussion recently on this refract potential in the US; you mentioned it, Schlumberger mentioned it. I am curious as to your take on the overall potential, is this really a marginal source of incremental demand where we\u2019re just looking for a silver lining given the overall activity reductions or could this really be a material source of incremental frac demand here and is this trend primarily technology driven or is it being more driven by your customers responding to the cyclical downturn?","Jeff Miller","Hi Scott, the refrac economics are attractive both for our clients and certainly for Halliburton. We\u2019ve been refracking in essence for a couple of years and we actually see this as a natural extension with the maturing of unconventional wells over time. Our Halliburton technology was designed specifically to address better production which includes how to refrac, so our diversion technology around AccessFrac does that spectacularly as well as CYPHER was designed with refract in mind from the standpoint of not only at the well level but also identifying candidates at a field level. I would say what has changed in terms of giving it energy right now, more energy is the current market and access to capital. So I think those are going together. I do believe we will see growth there, and I think that growth will be great for Halliburton. ","Scott Gruber ","And then an unrelated follow up, one of the primary debates amongst investors currently is recovery potential. You mentioned the responsiveness of shales to an improvement in commodity price. How do you think about the potential for your North American revenues to return toward a 2014 level? Is this an unreasonable assumption on a multiyear basis, how do you think about the potential for your international revenues to rebound to that same 2014 type level?","Jeff Miller","Well, look, the North America market is again one of the most adaptable markets and we expect that, that kind of growth and improvement will be acting as the swing producer. And so I see the potential over time as we described the past recovery being sort of activity stabilizes, then pricing and then input costs catch up but overall the ability for North America to expand is certainly there and if we kind of look back it served us intensity in North America. If we go back to 2008, our rig counts arguably flat with 2014 today but our revenues over that same period of time have doubled. So I expect that the focus on making better wells which is right in our wheelhouse will continue to be important. ","Operator","And your next question comes from James West from Evercore ISI Group. ","James West ","Mark, quick question for you on the divestitures. Obviously you\u2019re going to be marketing these assets very soon. Was curious, so one, how you think about achieving kind of maximum value given these are very high quality assets that are all for grabs now? And then two, how quickly do you think we or the market will hear about who the likely buyers are of these assets?","Mark McCollum","Those are great questions, James. Obviously in this kind of a market, you\u2019re always a little worried about the process but we've been really excited as I said in my prepared remarks about the level of interest that\u2019s been shown in these assets. I mean these types of assets only come on the market once in a generation. And so we\u2019ve just had a tremendous outpouring of response to very quality potential buyers both what you consider strategic buyers inside the industry, outside the industry, global-based as well as very capable financial sponsors have looked at it. We\u2019re going to run a process for each business for the two \u2013 or for the ones that have been announced, we will run two separate processes. We will run a process over the top of them, in case there are buyers that are interested in all of the businesses in combination but we think by doing it in that way, that gives adequate and complete opportunity for anybody who is interested and participate and to come and to stake their claim. ","The process for themselves generally will stretch, I am going to guess about five months. So it\u2019s going to be in the later part of the summer before that we will probably have identified buyers. Before we can really make any kind of analysis, we\u2019re going to have to go back to have conversations with Department of Justice and other competition authorities who are looking at this to make sure that the buyers that have been identified will be acceptable to them. Remember that the process is not just divestiture for the sake of getting proceeds. The process here is to make sure that we\u2019re maintaining competition in the marketplace and so they'll have an interest in making sure that the identified buyers are going to be able to make sure that those businesses will be sustainable in the marketplace, will be viable competitors once the process is completed. ","James West ","And then just unrelated question from me, maybe Jeff or Christian, on the supplier side, your supplier side, you\u2019re getting some benefit, it sounds like from your sand, maybe chemicals and truck and things like that, have you seen the full benefit yet and will that show up in the second quarter? And what\u2019s the magnitude of kind of the reduction in the cost from your major suppliers?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, James. I am not going to talk about the amount, lot of those discussions are ongoing but we are making progress. I would \u2013 discounts are still better the closer that they are to the wellhead and by that means they have better visibility of really what the full impact of the current downturn might look like. As we work with our suppliers, we\u2019re clearly consolidating those suppliers and we\u2019re doing more volume and we will continue to do more volume with the vendors that work with us to lower our costs. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company.","Bill Herbert ","Mark, the divestiture process once again. Are you able to shed any light as to what the after-tax consequences will be associated with the sale of these businesses? Should there be a tax burden associated with the sale of these businesses or how do you think about that? I mean it\u2019s contingent upon price of course but I'm curious as to what we could expect from an after-tax standpoint not on number specifically but conceptually?","Mark McCollum","Conceptually, yes. There will be an after-tax impact of these as they are -- we do expect them to sell well above book value. And so there will be a tax consequence of that. We don't know what that's going to be at this point in time, even if I did, not sure I would tell you \u2013 I would have to kill you. That is just joking but I think that \u2013 but we do expect these businesses to go for a really good value. I mean I think anyone who is interested is going to have to bring their A game, considering how many people are interested in these projects and so they are going to be pretty traditional asset sales that will have an after-tax impact themselves. But I think at this point in time we still fundamentally believe in economics of the transaction as we outlined, if you know, at the time that we announced the overall deal. We believe that's intact and our view is that there will be adequate proceeds to be able to have cash at the closing to help Christian do what he needs to do. ","Bill Herbert ","And then secondly, Jeff, with regard to the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, are you getting any visibility from customers with regard to telegraphing when they\u2019re going to start monetizing these wells? Are there any discussions about them getting going in the second half of the year or what pricing thresholds they are contemplating that will result in the greenlight going off?","Jeff Miller","I mean they lack the clarity in terms of the outlook as much as sort of anyone does in the market right now. So I don't think they\u2019ve even concluded around the timing, though it would certainly be at a point in time that they see commodity prices rising as opposed to where they are. And I think around the dock inventory, of course a couple of comments. First, it represents we think about 4000 wells, that\u2019s against the backdrop of 55,000 wells that were drilled last year. So that's one thought. And then the second is, it\u2019s really a limited subset of customers that can even afford to talk about drilled but uncompleted wells at least as a practice. So from our standpoint, without precision around the timing it certainly looks like deferred revenue for Halliburton and arguably when it occurs it will accelerate sort of tightening and recovery. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies & Co.","Brad Handler ","Thanks guys. Maybe a couple of related questions, related to the North American market. But just first your guidance, want to make sure I heard that. I think you said mid-single-digit North American margins in 2Q that's despite not having a couple or more hundred basis points relative to cost savings and that's include \u2013 but you\u2019re factoring in effective pricing is continuing to presumably be full quarter worth of pricing declines and the like. So first of all, I guess, is the mid single digit, did we hear that correctly?","Christian Garcia","That is correct. So Brad, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, activity continues to decline, price continues to be under pressure and therefore margins go flock down to the mid-single-digits. So it\u2019s an all-in including the elevated cost structure that we have.","Brad Handler ","Can you maybe just comment a little bit on, in Q1 maybe order of magnitude activity versus price realization combined for that minus 25% sequential performance, can you split it up for us a little bit?","Christian Garcia","So just in terms of activity versus price, if you just look at the progression of our results in the first quarter, January held up actually better than the March as you can expect, the exit rate was much weaker than where we started. Overall in terms of our activity that our frac stage count is actually down just in the mid-single digits. That would imply that this tremendous amount of pricing that we were impacted by. So we think it as we go into Q2, the activity will continue to come down. Don't know what it might be, as I pointed out, right now rig count is down about 30% and the decline continues. But we will continue to have pricing pressure.","Jeff Miller","Maybe just a follow-up as well, so clients are really myopic on price right now and as data points are continuing to deteriorate, we obviously also talk about the falling rig count, service capacity sorting itself out. But at this point in time as I said in my prepared remarks, simply don't believe that this is sustainable in terms of pricing. And so it's a point as service capacity sorts itself out we clearly expect clients to return to making better wells which is right in our wheelhouse. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from David Anderson from Barclays. ","David Anderson ","Jeff, you talked about two of the three camps of service companies out there based on unsustainable models. And as we think about kind of the new equilibrium performance for the rig count, we know there\u2019s going to be a lot of excess capacity. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how you think about attrition levels in the pressure pumping market? I mean how long can these guys continue working \u2013 do you think they are weighing on capital infusions there and I guess I am also just kind of secondarily wondering how you think about normalized margins in North America going forward? Do you think that it could be lower than the past just to keep those guys on the sideline? Just kind of curious how you are thinking about this as it develops?","Jeff Miller","Let me reframe that a little bit and think in terms of sort of capacity in general. If we look back before we look ahead, capacity comes out pretty quickly and actually when it comes out it doesn't generally get back to work. And that is \u2013 and so if we look at the activity today and how hard the equipment is working to the extent that equipment is getting burned up at prices that don't make sense and new capital is not spent to replace it. Then it\u2019s not necessarily a linear attrition of equipment. What happens is it sits on the sidelines until it's needed and then it's not there, and we really saw that happen last year when capacity was taken up very quickly. And so I don't expect it to be any different going forward, which is really underpins our investment in the Q-10 and our ability to operate more sustainably at a lower cost. ","David Anderson ","And then are you thinking about kind of normalized margins yet, is it too early to be talking about that? We used to talk about kind of mid-to high 20% margin. But just wondering if you\u2019re thinking that sort of have to be a little bit lower to keep that capital from coming back in the market, we\u2019ve been in this just to kind of avoid this cycle we seem to be constantly in?","Jeff Miller","I don't think so. I mean the path to the 20s and beyond \u2013 I mean all of that still works, because that\u2019s in our sort of design of service and execution model, but because things are so myopic today on price, this isn\u2019t really the time to have \u2013 we can\u2019t act on that meaningfully. But as Christian mentioned, as activity stabilizes then healing begins and at that point certainly pricing and input costs catch-up and we\u2019re back on the path. But we have to get to some stabilized level of activity and that's where the efficiency model that we execute really shines it on. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen.","Jim Crandell ","Thank you. Mark, is there a scenario where in order to close the Baker Hughes deal that you also need to divest wireline, fluids, the chunk of completions, offshore cementing, maybe some stimulation vessels?","Jeff Miller","Jim, as I said in my prepared remarks, we know that there will be some additional divestitures to do. We don't exactly know what those are going to be. That\u2019s going to be something that will be found out as we have discussions with the competition authorities both Department of Justice as well as elsewhere in the world and I just can't even speculate at this point in time what those other divestitures might be. ","Jim Crandell ","Mark, if it\u2019s all of the ones that I said, is there a level where you questioned doing the deal?","Jeff Miller","There is not a level that we question doing the deal. We still fundamentally believe in everything that we see that the level of divestitures will be substantially below the $7.5 billion threshold that was laid out in the merger agreement. So we\u2019re still operating well within that level and no, there is not a level at this point that we would walk away from the deal. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead ","So just wanted to get general sense, I mean guys, again over time done really well obviously on the revenue front. Just trying to get a sense on the dynamics internationally from pricing and on the margin dynamic, the decrementals from here and when you might start to see some stabilization in the international markets?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Kurt. The international markets are very competitive and at this point all our clients are asking for discounts. The reality is there\u2019s just not a lot to give. If we go back to 2008 that international markets really never recovered certainly entirely from that. But the short answer is yes we are seeing pricing pressure. Clients are asking for discounts. Though what I would say a better leading edge discussion is around efficiency and contracting which is how to better work with Halliburton to take system costs out of drilling. And so I would say we\u2019re not having \u2013 at the beginning of those discussions were truly internationally, that's a key component of the path forward to for our customers. ","Christian Garcia","And Kurt, let me comment on international decrementals. We\u2019re still targeting that our decrementals international to be better than in 2009. And one of the reasons why we feel that way is because of how our margins behaved in Q1. As you know, internationally our decrementals usually are the harshest in the first quarter. Historically it\u2019s 45% plus but if you look at our Q1 decrementals it was half that historic rate. Plus we have strong incrementals on a year-on- year basis, growth in both revenue and operating income international. So every quarter is going to be a battle but we\u2019re starting -- where we stand right now in terms of achieving the objective of having lower decrementals than in 2009. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley.","Ole Slorer ","Christian, just give a little bit more \u2013 shed a little bit more light on the $1.2 billion charges. You mentioned [indiscernible] and how much was the working capital?","Christian Garcia","Ole, we couldn\u2019t hear you but I think you are looking for the savings from the charge. Okay, so let me just take a stab at that. We are taking multiple actions, including right-sizing our infrastructure, we reduced our headcount and lowering our supplier costs and obviously this has been a global effort. Right now our estimate for the savings from these actions is about $1 billion annually but as Jeff pointed out that and as I pointed out in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re not done. We will continue to take a hard look at our operations in the second quarter and we will continue to make adjustments. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Boyd ","Hi, thanks. Just wanted to really clarify something because there's a lot of talk of the backlog of wells building up that you mentioned. But then at the same time you mentioned that your frac stages were only down -- what was that -- mid single digits sequentially but the rig count was down 27% sequentially. So can you help me understand what's going on there? Are you just gaining that much market share or is the backlog of wells not all that abnormally high?","Jeff Miller ","Well, there's always some level of uncompleted wells in any market because of pad drilling. So if you kind of look at the numbers of pads, generally speaking, the rigs will drive uncompleted wells sort of systematically into the marketplace. So but we typically see a flight to quality in a market like this and so as we've said we are defending our customer base. We focus on the fairway players and particularly those players that value our efficiency model. As I've said we won't work at silly prices but our strategy to be the sustainable lowest-cost per barrel of oil operator holds true. And I think we're seeing it play out.","Dan Boyd ","Yes, impressive market share gains. And then you've touched on this a number of times in the call, and just talking about industry attrition and pressure pumping equipment and yet it happens typically through cannibalization of the fleets I think as you touched on. But can you just maybe give us a guess as to how much attrition we might expect if we stayed at current market levels?","Jeff Miller ","It's really too early in the cycle for me to give you a number, but let's think about it this way. While the total market volumes of pumping are down year on year or certainly sequentially are down, the volume per well is up 12% sequentially, which means that the equipment that's out there is working harder than it's ever worked. There may be less of it working but working harder, which says that stacked equipment does get cannibalized unless people are making capital investments in equipment. So I think we're going to see a similar attrition sort of behavior that we saw through the last cycle.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.","Jeff Miller ","Thank you Danielle. I guess I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of comments. As we've said while we work through the current market, we'll continue to control costs to protect our margins while playing offense to protect our market position with key clients. As we look through the cycle we'll continue to invest in those capabilities to deliver our long-term strategies in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. I'm confident that our people, technology and experience will outperform the market and emerge as we have in the past a stronger company in the recovery. So look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

Let\u2019s get right to it this morning. In the first quarter, Halliburton experienced significant challenges in North America related to rail disruptions. One of the things I\u2019m pleased with is the way our organization executed through the sand logistics complexities in order to minimize disruptions for our customers.","The company you want to own and work with is a company that can execute through these issues and any other potential headwinds. Halliburton identified the problem, addressed it and worked through it. Business conditions are back to where we thought they would be. As a result, I really like what I see shaping up and I am confident in our ability to reach normalized margins in North America this year.","After taking into account the impact from rail, we wrapped up the quarter in line with what we expected. Here are our highlights for the quarter. Total company revenue of $5.7 billion represents a 34% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income was $619 million driven by robust market conditions in North America.","Once again, for the last five quarters, we have delivered the highest returns in the industry. I\u2019m very pleased with the way our North America business exited the quarter. In March, our production enhancement product service line achieved record stage count per crew, higher than at the previous peak in 2014.","Our international run rate for tender activity in 2018 is on a pace to double 2017 levels. Our Completion and Production division was impacted by U.S. rail disruption during the quarter but we still achieved a strong exit to the quarter with March margins in the mid upper teens. Finally, our Drilling and Evaluation division had strong year-over-year revenue growth of 15% with operating income growing 54%.","Today, all eyes are on North America as it continues to play a larger role as a global producer. Activity in the U.S. remains resilient as our customers have a large portfolio of economically viable projects in today\u2019s commodity price environment. We expect our customers to remain busy through the rest of 2018 creating significant demand for our services.","The combination of steady rig count growth and completions intensity is improving demand across all of our product service lines. In addition, we believe the pressure pumping market is undersupplied today and will remain tight for the rest of 2018. Despite the incremental horsepower coming into the market, I believe this undersupply will persist as wear and tear continues to degrade existing equipment.","I\u2019ve been saying this for a bunch of quarters; degradation is real. Roughly 50% of announced horsepower does not translate into new crews. I know this because we analyze the difference between horsepower additions announced and the related number of crews that are produced. This means that about half the new build equipment is being used to replace or add to crews already in the field.","A key driver of this degradation is service intensity which quickly translates to shorter equipment lives and higher maintenance costs. Maintenance costs are growing and the costs are real. Today, we pump three to four times of sand volume through equipment compared to 2014.","We\u2019ve moved away from gel-based frac to slick water frac increasing the abrasion on our equipment. At the same time, we increased the pumping rate compounding the wear and tear on equipment. And with increased efficiency, we\u2019ve improved utilization achieving more pumping hours per day; again, more wear and tear.","In this environment, Halliburton has a clear advantage with our proprietary equipment and preventative maintenance technology that reduces our relative maintenance expense. The expansion in our operating margins over the last year demonstrates our superior ability to manage through the increased maintenance.","We have generated industry-leading returns while expensing our maintenance costs in contrast to many of our competitors who capitalize their costs. The current activity level in the U.S. is continuing to create tightness across the supply chain. The three most significant areas of supply chain tightness that we see are rail, trucking and labor. I\u2019ll address how we\u2019re handling each of these next.","The first quarter was a tough quarter for sand delivery. I learned more about train logistics than I ever dreamed I would; proof that getting to the future first is not always fun. We were the first to recognize the rail issue and describe it for the market. I appreciate the hard work by our sand desk to minimize the disruptions to our customers while a significant volume of our sand supply was impacted by the rail stoppages. As I stated before, this issue is temporary and is behind us.","Looking forward, the U.S. rail system is experiencing high demand driven by strong economic activity. This increased overall demand is adding stress to the rail system, while at the same time our industry is attempting to move more and more sand every quarter. This stress is making the timing of deliveries less predictable.","Our sophisticated sand supply desk and logistics system is working to mitigate this problem. I believe the ultimate solution is the increased use of local sand. We intend to utilize those resources to provide services for our customers as increased supply comes online in the latter half of the year.","After rail, the next logistics bottleneck is trucking. The issue today is not in tractors and trailers, it\u2019s finding qualified drivers and dealing with congested infrastructure. Containerized sand is an effective tool to reduce demurrage and truck demand per well site. We continue to roll out our containerized sand solution currently deployed across about a third of our fleet to reduce cost, increase efficiency and improve our service quality.","The labor market is tight. U.S. unemployment is at an all-time low and in some basins it\u2019s just above 2%. That is tight. We have the advantage of being able to recruit nationally to find qualified field personnel. However, given the level of activity today, there will likely be wage inflation and additional pricing will be necessary for cost recovery.","I view these supply chain constraints as a welcome sign of a growing market and expect to execute through these challenges on our path to normalized margins in North America this year. We remain on the path to normalized margins and our March performance was a strong step in the right direction.","To get to these margins, we will pull the three levers that I\u2019ve discussed several times over the last year. Price is clearly important and we push price every day; first to recover costs and then to gain net pricing. Our customers understand that we have to get both cost recovery as well as return to a price that is healthy for our business.","Just as important as price is utilization which we continue to optimize as the market grows. Our scale makes us even more valuable to Halliburton. And finally playing into both pricing and utilization is technology. Technology creates value for our customers, and at the same time reduces cost for Halliburton.","As the market grows, North America\u2019s role in the global supply equation is changing. This fundamental shift means that North America\u2019s shale oil has moved from swing producer to base-load supplier to meet growing global demand. Nothing is more evident of this change than our customers actively redirecting spending from international non-OPEC opportunities towards North America.","This shift in CapEx allocation is largely driven by the shorter cycle return and lower risk profile North America shale provides. This change didn\u2019t happen overnight. In fact, it\u2019s been occurring over the last several years. In this paradigm, we see sustainable growth over a longer period of time rather than the boom and bust, which has characterized past cycles in North America.","This sustained activity is good for Halliburton. It allows us to leverage our supply chain logistics infrastructure, capture efficiencies around repair and maintenance programs and implement technologies at scale to reduce cost and increase production. Therefore, we can optimize our systems and be more efficient with our investments. This is important because in this environment Halliburton will generate strong free cash flow.","Turning to the international markets, Halliburton has never been better positioned for recovery than it is today. Halliburton is in every meaningful market competing for work, winning work and executing work with outstanding service quality. This is not something I could have said ahead of the prior cycle. I\u2019ve always said you have to be present to win and Halliburton is more than present. We are winning.","In Latin America, I see improving activity offset by pricing pressures throughout the year. I am pleased with the footprint and legacy we have in Latin America and our market share today is a testament to our focus on service quality throughout the cycle.","In Argentina, there are exciting improvements in unconventional resources. We successfully completed the longest lateral section ever in the Vaca Muerta formation, flawlessly pumping 42 stages, a great job by the team demonstrating their focus on our value proposition in Argentina.","In addition, a record number of blocks are scheduled to be auctioned in Mexico and Brazil representing a pipeline of service activity in the coming years. We look forward to working with our customers to maximize the value of their investments.","Certainly a lowlight for the quarter is the write-down of our remaining assets in Venezuela. We continue to work at a reduced level as we believe the ultimate path for resolution in Venezuela involves oil and gas.","In the Middle East and Asia, we\u2019ve experienced modest increases in activity offset by pricing pressure. We\u2019ve grown our market share in this region throughout the downturn on the strength of our service quality and technology offerings.","In the first quarter, we delivered the industry\u2019s first in-situ bubble point measurement using our wireline CoreVault technology. This data is important for reservoir characterization allowing our customers to better understand their gas to oil ratio before flowing the well to surface. By collaborating with customers, we continue to create technology that improves our services and maximizes their asset value.","In Europe, Africa, CIS, typical seasonality created a dip in activity for the first quarter but we expect to see modest rig count growth throughout the year. I expect initial activity increases to be in the North Sea, Nigeria and Ghana. One highlight from the region is progress around digital applications. We continue to believe that our approach to digital which focuses on open architecture, solving business problems and working with partners will prove the most effective over time.","I remain encouraged by the long-term prospects of the international markets. Green shoots of activity are starting to create areas of localized tightness but this additional activity is not enough to reverse the pricing pressure we are under today.","The run rate for 2018 international tendering activity is on a pace to double from 2017 which leads us to believe that there will be improved activity in 2019 to help soak up resources and create and opportunity for pricing inflection.","Before I conclude, I want to spend a moment talking about Sperry Drilling because I am really excited about what I see. Sperry developed and launched several exciting technologies in the last year. First is EARTHSTAR, our very deep resistivity service which provides customers greater reservoir insight to create better wells by utilizing improved mapping and real-time geosteering decisions.","Next is our ICRUISE intelligent rotary steerable system that reduces drilling time and increases well placement accuracy to optimize asset value for our customers. And finally, our new upgraded fleet of drilling motors are proving effective in U.S. land. These motors are more powerful and have improved reliability maximizing drilling efficiency for our customers.","I am really excited about these technologies and the enthusiasm we\u2019re seeing from our customers. We supercharged our R&D spend for this drilling technology and we made terrific progress in a short period of time. The market for these technologies and additional equipment in our development pipeline is growing. For this reason, we will spend a big part of this year\u2019s capital budget on these tools. I expect the investment to generate attractive returns in the years ahead.","Overall, I am excited about the market outlook for the remainder of the year. I am confident in Halliburton\u2019s ability to grow revenue and expand margin in North America and the strength and performance of our international business as the international recovery unfolds. Our strategy is executable, it\u2019s working well and resonates with our customers. Our strategy is delivering industry-leading returns and I am confident that it will continue to do so.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update.","Chris Weber","Thanks, Jeff. Let\u2019s start with a summary of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2017. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion and adjusted operating income was $619 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 34% and over 200%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America.","Moving to our division results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue increased by 46% and operating income was in tripled to $500 million. These results were primarily due to improvements in United States land. Additionally, results improved due to increased well completion services in Europe, Africa, CIS and higher stimulation activity in the Middle East.","In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 15% while operating income increased 54%. These results were primarily driven by increased drilling activity in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly in the North Sea. These results were partially offset by activity declines across multiple product service lines in Latin America.","In North America, revenue increased 58%. This improvement was led by increased activity throughout the United States land sector in the majority of Halliburton\u2019s product service lines, primarily pressure pumping, as well as higher drilling and artificial lift activity.","Latin America revenue decreased by 1% due to activity declines in Venezuela and Mexico. These results were partially offset by increases in drilling and pressure pumping services in Argentina.","Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue improve by 19% mainly due to higher drilling activity and well completion services in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in Russia and Azerbaijan. These results were partially offset by activity reductions in Angola.","In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased 7%. This increase is largely the result of increased drilling and stimulation activity in the Middle East and increased drilling activity in Indonesia, offset by lower completion tool sales and project management activity in the Middle East.","Regarding Venezuela, as a result of recent changes in its foreign currency exchange system and continued devaluation of the local currency, combined with U.S. sanctions and ongoing political and economic challenges, we wrote down all of our remaining investment in the country. This resulted in a $312 million, net of tax charge during the first quarter. We continue to work in Venezuela and carefully manage our go-forward exposure.","In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $69 million and net interest expense was $140 million in line with our previous guidance. We expect these items to continue at this run rate in the second quarter.","Our effective tax rate for the first quarter, excluding Venezuela-related charges, came in at approximately 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform and our geographic earnings mix. Going forward, we expect our 2018 full year and second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.","Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $572 million with capital expenditures of $501 million ending the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2.3 billion.","For the full year 2018, we now anticipate our CapEx spend to be about $2 billion. We like what the market is showing us for 2018 and beyond and while spending slightly more than our D&A, customer demand supports this investment and we expect it to generate attractive returns.","We ended the quarter with 2.3 billion in cash and expect to generate strong free cash flow in 2018. Consistent with prior years, we expect our cash balance to grow in the second half of the year.","Now, turning to our thoughts on the second quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect our revenue and margin to be similar to the first quarter, primarily due to continued pricing pressure in the international market offsetting activity increases.","In our Completion and Production division, we expect strong revenue and margin growth driven by the strengthening North America market. Based on what we see today we believe current second quarter consensus EPS provides a good target for our performance.","Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Chris. Let me sum it up. First, I want to thank all of our employees for what they do to deliver our value proposition every day. It really matters and we saw it this quarter. In North America, I am pleased with the way Halliburton executed through the quarter given the challenges we faced.","We managed through the supply chain issues and exited the quarter on the path to normalized margins. Looking ahead, I am excited about the way the North America market is shaping up for the remainder of the year and the role it is playing in the global supply.","My view on the international market remains intact. I\u2019m encouraged by the activity outlook that should ultimately lead to price inflection in 2019. We are the execution company. We are focused on service quality, capital discipline, generating superior financial performance and delivering industry-leading shareholder returns.","Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","James West","Good morning, guys.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, James.","James West","Jeff, I want to dig in a little more on the pressure pumping market. I think you gave some good color there on what you guys are seeing, and there\u2019s been some commentary suggesting different factors at play here and perhaps that\u2019s because you\u2019re sold out and demand\u2019s coming in and others are trying to put equipment to work. But I wonder if you could talk to some of the dynamics you\u2019re seeing both the supply and the demand side? How much demand is running above supply these days, how long this could stay tight and then how that\u2019s going to factor in into pricing for Halliburton in particular?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, James. It is different. Our customers are asking us for equipment. We\u2019re not trying to put older equipment into the market. And because of that it makes for a totally different conversation. But I think backing up and looking at overall supply and demand, it looks like the market\u2019s undersupplied probably 1 million, 1.5 million horsepower today, and I expect that it stays that way certainly for this year and likely beyond, and a lot of that is because of the attrition that I talk about that is very real, and we look at horsepower announcements versus actual fleet adds. And all that does is it affected about half of the horsepower announced is going back into existing fleets tells me that that market stays tight. And so for that reason from our perspective anyway, we see solid pricing. We push it every day. We\u2019re not going to get into the strategy around how we do that, but certainly see cost to cover \u2013 pricing to cover inflation out there as well as pushing on the net pricing side of that as well.","James West","Okay. So we should think that the net pricing gains will continue for that time period as well?","Jeff Miller","Yes.","James West","Okay, perfect. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open.","Bill Herbert","Good morning, Jeff. With regard to international, as you went through all three different geo markets, it struck me that the continued refrain is activity going to offset \u2013 not partially offset by pricing, and yet your international top line was up 8.5% year-over-year. So do we expect international top line for the year to be up for Halliburton or does \u2013 as the year unfold, the year-over-year gain is compressed to the point where topline is flat?","Jeff Miller","No, we should see some \u2013 I think we outgrow the expected spend internationally. So I see the top line is up for the full year 2018.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And then with regard to \u2013 it seems that pricing remains pretty corrosive. I\u2019m just curious, is pricing continuing to go down or has it stabilized at really oppressive levels?","Jeff Miller","No, I would say pricing continues to go down. I mean, we look at pricing internationally. We\u2019re excited about the volume of activity and we like to see more tenders. But I can tell you our customers know that we\u2019re at the bottom as well. And so from our perspective price is actually continuing to move down not up internationally as we start to see the large projects come through. So I expect that we see inflection in 2019, expect that we gain share as we work through the cycle and that\u2019s why we see revenues up for the full year. But clearly that is going to offset the benefit from higher activity.","Bill Herbert","Okay.","Chris Weber","As we do see, like we said on D&E which is largely international, flattish second quarter to first, but we would expect as we move into the second half of the year that we\u2019ll see it \u2013 start to see some improvement in our international results and thus our D&E results. Not a lot, but some incremental improvement as we get closer to that inflection point that we\u2019re seeing in 2019 that Jeff talked about.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Meakim","Good morning. So, Jeff, maybe if we could talk about where your contract position sits for frac, just thinking about your existing fleet versus leading edge pricing, how much that roll forward do you think will support incremental margins through the year even if net pricing were more on the flatter side, just to give us a sense of how much that impact could be?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Sean. Let\u2019s go back and talk about the three levers. So price is always important. So when I look at margin progression, clearly price is important. But at the same time utilization is an important lever and allows us to move on the margin front as does technology help us do the same thing, and technology in effect helps our customers generate more value but at the same time reduces our cost, and that\u2019s the important piece of that in terms of supporting our margin expansion outlook for the balance of the year. Our business development guys are in the market every single day, and because of our efficiency and technology and science, I mean that\u2019s the price support for what we do. But at the same time, those other two levers are very important.","Sean Meakim","So in terms of looking through the year, fair to say that there\u2019s still some pull forward as your backlog of contracts roll into current pricing, so that\u2019s a net tailwind for you?","Jeff Miller","Yes, I would say if we look back a year now and talk about the contracts that we had there, a large part of that has rolled over. And so what we look at now is improving the margins on the contracts that we have. And a lot of this does get to efficiency and this is one of the reasons why our business development team is so focused on where are the customers where we can get the best efficiency and utilization. That\u2019s a key part of how we expand margins. And so that opportunity is clearly still there. Customers remain urgent and that customer urgency is critical because even spending within cash flow, for example, urgency around effectiveness of every dollar spent matters a lot and that may not have been the case two years ago at the absolute bottom of the downturn but today that is a critical factor for our customers. And again where we spend a lot of our energy is making sure that we are able to execute that way.","Sean Meakim","Got it, understood. And then just thinking about the other service lines in North America, curious how pricing progressed end of quarter when thinking about drilling services, cementing, wireline, coiled tubing? You touched on it a little bit in prepared comments but just what are your expectations for those other lines as we move through the year and the impact on C&P as well as C&E?","Jeff Miller","Well, I think none of those service lines declined as much as pressure pumping did through the downturn, so they don\u2019t have as far to move up. Though that said, I do expect a growing market and as the rig count rise up I suspect we\u2019ll see more tightness around those things and the ability to move price up modestly.","Sean Meakim","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Jeff Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jeff Miller","Angie?","Angie Sedita","Good morning, guys. Sorry about that. Jeff, so I agree. There\u2019s certainly a big difference between incremental horsepower and replacement horsepower. Can you give us your thoughts on how much horsepower incrementally do you think is coming into the market? And then you touched on also a very fair point on the ability to deploy new versus older equipment and maybe talk about the pricing differential on the newer equipment versus the older equipment?","Jeff Miller","Sure, Angie. We look at sort of headline horsepower in the marketplace. We think it\u2019s probably 18 million horsepower, somewhere in that range. We look at what\u2019s been announced in terms of new build and reactivations that comes to maybe 4.5 million horsepower. Of that, we expect roughly half of that is going to get plowed back into existing fleets. In Halliburton, we\u2019ve maintained our fleets at 36,000 horsepower on average which tells me that we\u2019re getting differential performance around that equipment. And so that clearly in my view with the kind of rig count that we have today and the outlook for growth this year keeps that tight. And so I think that\u2019s how we see it unfolding for the balance of the year. Now your question around horsepower age, so much of that has to do \u2013 we think about our horsepower in terms of how effective is it on location and clearly we\u2019ve got proprietary technology around our pumping and in other things we do around maintenance, et cetera. And I think because of that, we\u2019re differentially positioned in the market and of course that has an impact on where we can work, how effective we are, what kind of margins we can earn.","Angie Sedita","All right, okay, fair enough. And then I don\u2019t know if you can talk about it at a high level as far as the pricing mechanism of your contracts. Is it fair to think that the majority of your contracts are re-priced at the beginning of the year or is it daggered, number one? And then midyear as pricing continues potentially to move higher, do you have an opportunity to revisit it or is it normally done once a year, twice a year? Or just at a high level, how do those contracts work?","Jeff Miller","Angie, that\u2019s really maybe the way it was several years ago. But I\u2019d say today it\u2019s staggered. It\u2019s all over the place as we work through the downturn and back out of the downturn, a lot of variability in what contracts look like. So I certainly wouldn\u2019t frame it that way. Really it\u2019s a matter of execution every day and demonstrating the value so that we can have a value discussion.","Angie Sedita","All right, thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jud Bailey","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about or circle back on getting back to normalized margins this year and all the discussion around pricing. Jeff, just to be clear, do you think you could hit normalized margins this year if leading-edge frac pricing does not increase from here or we\u2019re trying to get an understanding of what can be efficiency driven, what\u2019s just simply new contracts rolling up to kind of leading edge if you could help us think through that please?","Jeff Miller","Yes, the short answer is price is always important but I talk about the three levers because I believe we get there on the back of improving utilization and technology. And I\u2019ve said that for a long time. Pricing\u2019s certainly helpful but not a requirement.","Jud Bailey","Okay, all right. Thanks for that. And my follow up is on the higher CapEx. Could you maybe give us a little bit of insight as to maybe where that incremental capital is going to go? You mentioned Sperry and ramping up there. How much of it maybe replacement and how do you think about the return on that incremental capital you\u2019re going to be spending this year?","Chris Weber","Jud, this is Chris. Like we said, we bumped our CapEx budget. Now I think so full year will be about $2 billion, a little bit higher than we were guiding before. And I think it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re pretty thoughtful about our capital investment decisions always looking at it through the returns lens and is it going to be value accretive, is it going to generate attractive returns. And that\u2019s what we saw with the opportunity with regards to the CapEx rate. And the majority of the increase is going into Sperry. And so we\u2019re excited about it. As Jeff talked about, this is a product line that we underinvested in for a number of years. This is a strategic priority for the organization. We\u2019re seeing great demand both for existing technology and the new technology and it\u2019s actually positioning equipment for work in 2019. And we think we\u2019ll generate attractive returns over the long term. So we\u2019re excited about the opportunity. But this CapEx raise in terms of guidance doesn\u2019t change our outlook or expectation for generating strong free cash flow this year nor our focus on capital discipline.","Jud Bailey","Okay, got it. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll turn it back. Thank you.","Chris Weber","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Anderson","Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, just kind of a general question around the normalized margin target. Now you\u2019re reiterating that margin target. Can you just help us understand how you define normalized? It seems like everybody has a different view on what that means. Just curious what that means to you in terms of activity utilization and pricing?","Jeff Miller","Yes, Dave, I\u2019ve defined normalized margins as 20%. That\u2019s been something we\u2019ve talked about it over some period of time and that\u2019s where I think the business settles. And if we go \u2013 we were getting to that place, we were at that place in 2014 realistically. What we had was demand go away but it wasn\u2019t necessarily an oversupplied market. What we had was a downturn where demand went away. But I fully expect that we\u2019ll work back into that range and that\u2019s just what we\u2019re doing with the levers I described. Clearly price is important but the kind of utilization that we\u2019re able to get today because of our process or technology that\u2019s always a key component of any kind of margin outperformance.","David Anderson","So in other words this is sort of a steady-state level that you think you can achieve for a couple of years here at these levels based on what you mean by normalized?","Jeff Miller","Yes, that\u2019s why I used the word normalized because really we\u2019d always describe that as a normal range for this business was in that range and the work that we\u2019re doing is build around having this business operate at those levels.","David Anderson","And then if we think about kind of the fourth quarter, we often see some seasonal weakness here in North America. Do you think you can \u2013 so does that imply that you should be able to hit this target by third quarter if we assume sort of a downtick in fourth quarter like we usually see?","Jeff Miller","Yes, I would say the behavior of the market probably looks somewhat consistent with what it does sort of every year and I\u2019ll just leave it at that. And in terms of timing, Q4 always have some spotty weather and Q1 this year had cold weather \u2013 had the rail issues that we had. So as we work through the year I suspect it\u2019s over the next couple of quarters.","David Anderson","And then a separate question on the sand side. You had talked about increasing use of local sand to mitigate some of these issues that you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter here. Can you give us a sense of how you see that the magnitude of that shift you think is going to happen over the next 12 months? Just kind of curious, sand\u2019s a big portion \u2013 a crucial element of your pressure pumping operations you always want to have for your customers. So like roughly how much of that \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to get in big picture numbers, so like what percentage of your Permian is sourced from rail and where do you think that could potentially lower to in 12 months?","Jeff Miller","Well, that\u2019s a moving target as we speak. So if we go back six months ago, it was zero and I suspect as we get into some time next year, there is a \u2013 for the market anyway there\u2019s a path to oversupply that market from the Permian. And that\u2019s sort of the projects that we see or at least are in process of getting built. So it\u2019s probably never a 100% but it could be a substantial portion of the sand demand in the Permian will come from buy-ins in the Permian. It\u2019s a dynamic we\u2019re starting to see in other basins as well. What it ultimately does is it serves to relieve pressure on rail and then certainly provides for more availability of Northern White to the markets that will probably continue to demand that.","David Anderson","Great. Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","James Wicklund","Good morning, guys.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, James.","James Wicklund","Having worked international for 15 years, the contingency always needed the contingency both on price and time and I understand your comment that the bidding activity is up but we really won\u2019t see the impact until '19. But there\u2019s been a great deal of talk about lump sum turnkey contracts in the Middle East especially and I know that we\u2019ve done those for a while but the level or the percentage of total business appears to have picked up. Can you talk a little bit about where that is today, where that is versus a couple of years ago? Do you do it with the same people or different people? And more importantly, we\u2019re all concerned that lump sum turnkey increases the risk to a company that bids that. Not all of them are executed well. And so the concern is or the hope is that you execute well and boost those margins and maybe surprise us for the upside by the end of the year on results. But can you talk about how that plays into lump sum turnkey contacts play into your view of international?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Jim. As you say, LSTK has been around for a long time. It\u2019s gone by a lot of different names over the years; integrated solutions, IPM, as I say a number of names. I think the key again is execution risk and how well we manage that. We\u2019re not afraid of execution risk and that\u2019s really the basis for the contract is that execution risk. What I do like about them is that they aren\u2019t the kind of investments in oil and gas that take long time in commodity exposure. So from a cash return standpoint, it certainly work. I\u2019d say the key components of executing those well around project management and understanding that risk. We\u2019ve got terrific experience during this. That share for Halliburton grew dramatically through the last two or three years and we\u2019ve done it for a long time. And so the skill sets are different and it takes time to develop those and I\u2019m pleased that we have those skills today at Halliburton and compete very effectively. But I would wrap up with though is that they do get progressively more competitive over time.","James Wicklund","Okay. So the same pricing pressures have to exist in those that exist from the overall market. Okay. And my follow up, if I could, you recorded record stages in the quarter which is good. You talk about the three levers that you can pull. Some people think because you have all this equipment, 100 \u2013 spreads out in the field that if they\u2019re out in the field, they\u2019re 100% utilized. Can you talk about \u2013 we can all guess what pricing might do but can you talk about the upside to utilization that exists over time in pressure pumping?","Jeff Miller","Yes, thanks, Jim. That\u2019s a really meaningful lever for Halliburton. And having spreads spoken for is radically different from utilization in terms of pumping hours per day. And so we spend a lot of time and apply big data and apply algorithms and have a lot of effort put into how do we drive better utilization of our equipment every minute of every day. And there is a lot of room to run there. And that also is why I spend so much time talking about customers and where we are most effective and customers that better utilize our value proposition because that is truly a win-win. But again to go back to the idea is there\u2019s plenty of room for us to run in that regard.","James Wicklund","Okay. Gentlemen, thank you very much.","Jeff Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Scott Gruber","Good morning.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gruber","Jeff, as we think about potential inflection in international pricing in 2019, what level of market growth do you think about that\u2019s required to drive that inflection? Is it a mid-single digit growth rate, again, so the market\u2019s efficient? Do we need to get the high-single digits, low-double digits? How do you think about what\u2019s required to drive some pricing next year?","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Scott. It\u2019s probably less than overall market number though mid upper single digits is a good place to think. But it\u2019s more around specific markets where we see tightness. And part of what we see right now is a sort of thinly spread addition of sort of activity is not sufficient in any particular market to create the tightness that would allow for pricing inflection. And so I think it\u2019s better to look at particular markets as we go through this process and it is maybe the overall. Clearly there\u2019s a place where overall growth is enough to create overall tightness. But I think the early innings of this will look more like specific markets or technologies that are tight.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And how do we think about what should be a normalized margin in D&E just given the shift towards more onshore work as we start this next up cycle and what appears to be more bundling, more turnkey contracts, how do we think about what normal on the D&E side of the business which is more international? And when can we get there given the contract roll schedule?","Jeff Miller","Look, I\u2019m not going to call that right now. I\u2019m really excited about where we\u2019re going in that space in terms of differentiated equipment and I talked about Sperry but I\u2019d also talk about our other service lines in D&E, excited about all of those. We\u2019ve made a lot of gains over the last several years in terms of open hole and deepwater technology around drilling fluids is fantastic and growing. And so I feel like those margins will continue to expand as we see sort of tightness appear around the world internationally. Those tend to be more heavily weighted internationally just because that\u2019s where more of the drilling activity is on a relative basis in North America. The actual drilling of a well is a smaller part of the overall ticket than the completion.","Scott Gruber","Got it. I appreciate it.","Jeff Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Waqar Syed","Thank you. Jeff, in early February you had guided down to like $0.10 impact to the quarter from sand-related issues. In hindsight, do you still feel that the impact was $0.10 during the quarter or was it less or more?","Chris Weber","Waqar, this is Chris. It was generally in line with what we thought it was going to be and we felt good with regards to the outlook that we provided and delivering on that. When you step back \u2013 we were the first to actually see this problem and get our arms around it. We\u2019re able to provide an update to the market and more importantly be able to start executing on the solution as it relates to working through the logistics constraints and minimizing disruption for our customers. And then when you think about our expectations for exiting the first quarter in a strong position and delivering on that, this all for the most part played out like we thought it was going to.","Waqar Syed","So that would be somewhere around \u2013 if I estimate it, around $600 million, $700 million of revenue impact, is that fair?","Chris Weber","From a revenue impact, I wouldn\u2019t want to comment. We talked about from $0.10 perspective. I think we were generally in that range. And so I think \u2013 and that\u2019s what I focus on.","Jeff Miller","It\u2019s not just the days that we were slowed down but in addition to that it\u2019s the response to those things which involves spot buying of very expensive sand, trucking things that ought to be railed. It\u2019s a long \u2013 number of things that play into that response that served to impact margins.","Waqar Syed","Okay. So it\u2019s more \u2013 a lot more cost issue and then some revenue impact, okay, that\u2019s fair. And that\u2019s probably my question but on the international side your revenue growth year-over-year was much better than what you\u2019ve seen for the competitors. Now you\u2019re guiding to kind of more flattish kind of international revenues in the second quarter. So was this just like an anomaly in 1Q or you think there was some market share gains underneath that?","Jeff Miller","No. I think that we\u2019re well positioned to continue to grow. Q1 is always down relative to Q4. Q2, it\u2019s following the same trajectory or curve that we\u2019ve seen sort of year-upon-year-upon-year. So I don\u2019t expect to see any changes there and expect to see continued outperformance or market share performance as we move into the next cycle. What\u2019s important is how well we\u2019re positioned internationally and I think that\u2019s the change then until now. We made a lot of investment back in '12, '13 to be better positioned internationally. I love where we are competing in every market. So I expect we\u2019ll perform very well into the next cycle.","Waqar Syed","And just one final question in terms of sand intensity per well, what are you seeing from your customers in the U.S.?","Jeff Miller","Yes, I would say that we are continuing to see sort of that flattish kind of activity. It\u2019s not wildly up, wildly down. Again, as I\u2019ve said before, sands one of those things we clearly want to optimize over time. It\u2019s certainly a cost but at the same time as companies figure out how to best complete wells, better design completions, sand can move up for a time. And then they sort of define the limits of up and down \u2013 of high and low. They tend to find some places most effective in the middle.","Waqar Syed","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Boyd","Thanks. Jeff, you mentioned internationally there are a number of markets or pockets that are stronger than others. So is the organization right-sized for that recovery or are you still spending to reallocate resources and is there an opportunity to maybe reallocate resources to those pockets of strength?","Jeff Miller","We\u2019re going to manage our cost structure pretty tightly as we go into the next cycle. Our value proposition is that we collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Our planning is in place to execute that strategy. And if we deploy resources, they\u2019ll be more focused on executing the work but the key is to maintain the efficiencies that we develop through the downturn and make sure that\u2019s part of whatever that ramp looks like going into the second half of this year and '19.","Chris Weber","And we take a global view of our equipment and tools and where they are, so we\u2019re going to allocate where we think we see the demand assuming it\u2019s cost effective to move in there. So definitely take a global perspective as it relates to our equipment allocation.","Dan Boyd","Okay. And then the follow up there is just on pricing. On the last call you said that international pricing was possible later in '18 and it sounds like now you\u2019re more definitively pushing that into 2019, a lot of that sort of driven based on these pockets of strength. But what\u2019s changed that is giving you less confidence in pricing this year?","Jeff Miller","Look, nothing\u2019s changed. I think it\u2019s more about when you see that in the P&L, the reality is pricing in pockets as market tightens towards the end of this year, I suspect that we see the ability to move on price. But overall we\u2019re going to still see working off of contracts that were either light last year or this year. And so when I talked about inflection, I don\u2019t suspect you actually see much of that until we get into 2019.","Dan Boyd","Okay. But from a leading-edge perspective you think pricing could happen still this year?","Jeff Miller","It could happen later this year.","Dan Boyd","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead","Thank you. Hi, good morning.","Jeff Miller","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Jeff, just wanted to follow up on the comments you made about the challenges on the rail side and how that\u2019s opening up opportunities to source for your customers and base in, let\u2019s say, in the Permian and other places. It kind of seems like it\u2019s kind of trading one logistical challenge for another logistical challenge, rails versus trucks. As you guys are going to think through the process and prepare for that shift, do you expect the truck dynamic to be less of an intensive challenge than the rails as you move into using this local sand?","Jeff Miller","Look, I think to start with, our logistics investment and our logistics team is terrific. And so we will work through whatever those challenges are as they appear. But I think some of the key building blocks are in place particularly around how we move sand on a local basis. I think the box technology gives us a lot of options around how to move sand in ways to be more effective with that. We\u2019ve got a lot of different ideas that I won\u2019t layout on this call for all the reasons you might imagine. But I\u2019m really excited about that shift and I don\u2019t think Northern White gets more focused on other parts of the country which again we\u2019ve got terrific logistics infrastructure to deal with that. And I think it actually creates just new opportunities. Will there be congestion? Yes, there probably will. But at the same time it feels \u2013 I can see a path to how we manage that that\u2019s exciting.","Kurt Hallead","Great. That\u2019s good color. And maybe on a quick follow up on that, how are things progressing in context of contracts for E&Ps relating to the local sand? And I don\u2019t know about the best way, maybe you can provide us some color without getting too specific for competitive reasons, but how much adoption have you started to see and how much do you have already kind of committed to go to customers for local sand going into late '18 and '19?","Jeff Miller","Look, Kurt, we\u2019re going to participate in that market. I think that our value proposition \u2013 when we view that market, things that bring the structural costs down are good for our business, all of our business including our customers, including Halliburton. And so we look at that as an opportunity to reduce the cost of this which actually allows our customers to do more work and do more of the work that I think is differential for Halliburton which is how to design and place fracs in a way that makes better well and does it more efficiently. So real excited about that. It\u2019s going to probably be more adopted as it becomes more available and clearly everything would indicate that there will be a lot of availability of that sand as we work through the balance of 2018, certainly into '19.","Kurt Hallead","Got it. Thanks. And then just one more follow up just on the international front. You guys referenced pickup in activity, the prospect for better pricing into '19. So it seems to me that some of these contracts that had been I guess awarded here recently, it looks like they contrast sharply to other market periods where they were maybe two or three-year contracts and kind of were a drag on margins for an extended period of time. So am I understanding the dynamics, so you had much more shorter duration contracts in your international market and therefore you\u2019ll start to get better margins in '19 and '20, is that how things are progressing?","Jeff Miller","Well, I would say it\u2019s certainly smaller and shorter as we worked into the downturn, and at least at this point in time feel somewhat shorter. Clearly we prefer that just so that we got the ability to flex around equipment as time moves on. Obviously there will be a mixed bag of contract both duration and prices. We worked through this. But I think the short answer is certainly up until this point we\u2019ve tended to see shorter duration contracts.","Kurt Hallead","That\u2019s great. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Miller for any closing remarks.","Jeff Miller","Thanks, Liz. Before we close, I\u2019d like to just highlight a couple of key takeaways. First, I\u2019m excited about the outlook for North America and our March exit margins clearly demonstrate our path to normalized margins.","And secondly, I\u2019m pleased to see the recovery trajectory in the international markets demonstrated by the increase in tender activity and believe that this will lead to pricing inflection in 2019.","So I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Liz, you may now close out the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."]}}
