As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, August 4, 2016.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Amrita Ahuja, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Amrita Ahuja - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's second quarter 2016 conference call. With us are Bobby Kotick, CEO; Thomas Tippl, COO; and Dennis Durkin, CFO. And for Q&A, Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision; Michael Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we'll be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of our SEC filings including our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and those indicated on the slides that is showing.","The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation and while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after today, August 4, 2016.","We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call, however, as discussed on our July 29 conference call, due to updated compliance and disclosure interpretation issued by the SEC staff on May 17, 2016, in the future, we will no longer be able to present non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of deferrals. As a result, this will be the last call where we provide such information. On this call and in the future, we will continue to provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of expenses, related stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, expenses, including legal fees, cost expenses, and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, expenses related to debt financings and refinancings and the associated tax benefits.","These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanations. There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary sheet.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered record second quarter performance with revenues up more than 100% and EPS up more than 300% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis as previously defined. As a result, we're raising our full-year guidance. Our continued success comes from the efforts of our over 10,000 employees. Their passion, dedication and focus are the reasons we're able to entertain hundreds of millions of players around the world and deliver value to our stakeholders.","This quarter was a record quarter in large measure because of the unique capability we have as a company to create new franchises. The truly extraordinary team at Blizzard launched Overwatch to incredible audience success. Overwatch already has over 15 million players who have spent about 0.5 billion hours playing the game and it has achieved success throughout the world including in China and Korea, where Overwatch is now the number one game in terms of share of playtime.","We remain focused on the priorities that we have outlined to you before: building our audiences around the world, growing engagement by continuously investing in new content for our audiences, celebrating our players through initiatives like competitive gaming and making certain we continue to be a great place to work.","Thomas and Dennis will now share with you the results of our record quarter. Thomas?","Thomas Tippl - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bobby. Our creative and commercial teams across our five operating divisions delivered a very strong first half of 2016 with broad-based record results. To expand on what Bobby mentioned, our results are driven by focus and execution against our three strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment. Let's start with audience reach, which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players in what is typically a seasonally softer quarter. In Q2, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 13% year-over-year and 29% quarter over quarter, driven by increases in players from Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone.","It's important to take a step back and review Blizzard's continued growth over the past few years. Blizzard has doubled its number of franchises, expanding into new genres, business models and platforms; and as a result, they have doubled the size of the audience over a relatively short period of time. This performance is due to the strength of the team at Blizzard and their strategic focus on building epic entertainment experiences that capture the imaginations of tens of millions of people globally.","Overwatch has had incredible momentum and has now reached over 15 million players globally, achieving this milestone more quickly than any game in Blizzard's history. In China, Overwatch broke Diablo III's record as the fastest selling PC game in the market's history. Additionally, Overwatch has claimed the number one position in Korean IGRs with over 30% share of playtime. This global success has led to roughly even player split between the East and West.","World of Warcraft momentum continues to build ahead of the August launch of Legion. MAUs have seen double-digit growth both quarter over quarter and year-over-year and Legion pre-purchases are tracking in line with the last expansion in 2014. In particular, we've had strong momentum in China following the launch of the Warcraft movie, which is now one of the highest grossing Hollywood releases ever in China and the biggest game-based movie release worldwide.","Activision MAUs were also a Q2 record and were up 11% year over year. This was largely driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty. Black Ops III continues to be the top-selling current-gen game life to date, and again, over performed the prior year's game across every key metric: MAUs, full game sales, in-game content and engagement.","Destiny also saw month on month growth in MAUs with the launch of our April update with the June announce of Destiny's next expansion, Rise of Iron. The continued hunger for great new content from this passionate community bodes well for the September launch of Rise of Iron. Digital pre-purchases so far are very strong and tracking ahead of last year's Taken King.","That leads me to our second strategic pillar. Once again, our compelling game worlds broke not only large communities but also deep engagement with nearly 10 billion hours of playtime during the second quarter. Blizzard franchises continued to display the best of gameplay that they are known for. As Bobby mentioned, players spent about 500 million hours playing Overwatch. Since launch, Blizzard added a competitive playbook to the game in June and new hero in mid-July and just introduced this week, Summer Games content, which includes an exciting new soccer-like game mode.","Both the new hero and Summer Games also added what was (08:58) to loot boxes that players can earn or purchase. In just the first day, we saw record engagement with the new Summer Games mode and its customization items. Blizzard is pleased with the strong adoption across all these releases and plans to continue adding new content and improving existing features to deliver a great ongoing experience to Overwatch players.","Hearthstone had its highest MAUs and highest quarterly time spent in the game's history this quarter on the back of the launch of the Whispers of the Old Gods expansion. This deep engagement drove a double-digit revenue increase year-over-year. Just last weekend at (09:39) Blizzard announced its fourth adventure set for release on August 11. One Night in Karazhan continues Hearthstone's tradition of bringing a charming and accessible approach to some of the most popular Warcraft settings. As with our other adventures, players will be able to experience a single player storyline and earn cards with their player versus player decks.","The strong engagement around our franchises also serves our initiatives outside of our games. Our esports and film and TV initiatives are not only a driver of audience expansion, but drive deeper engagement which will lead to longer franchise lives with greater profitability. First, on esports. Last year, BlizzCon had its highest livestream viewership ever with over 10 million people around the world tuning in, higher than the viewership for this year's NBA and MLB All Star games. This November, Blizzard will be hosting its tenth BlizzCon. One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of the Road to BlizzCon tournaments with global champions across a number of franchises being crowned, including the champion for the just-announced Overwatch World Cup.","We have also made a lot of progress in the launch of our esports network Major League Gaming. MLG presented to advertisers (11:02) in New York in May where they showcased a significant new product innovation that provides an enhanced viewing experience offering real-time statistics, leader boards and insights based on the competition you're watching, making the viewing experience far more accessible and rich. MLG also announced a partnership with Facebook to broadcast live competitions as the weekly Esports Report, providing broad reach for our premium content. Since the acquisition in December, MLG's reach has increased by more than 700% on Facebook.","MLG is also working closely with our internal teams to build up our esports leagues and events for key franchises. MLG and the Call of Duty World League hosted the Anaheim Open in June and are preparing for the upcoming Orlando Open as well. With the growth of the Call of Duty World League, Call of Duty esports viewership has increased by more than five times year-over-year to 33 million views of our Stage 1 events this year. And there are still major events to come, including the championships at Call of Duty XP this September, which we anticipate will be our most viewed Call of Duty esports event in history by a wide margin.","Our film and TV unit announced that the first two seasons of their first initiative, Skylanders Academy, have been sold to Netflix for global distribution. Skylanders Academy is an extremely high-quality animated TV show coming on the heels of the release of our innovative new game this fall, Skylanders: Imaginators, which was developed by the inventors of the toys to life category, Toys For Bob.","Now turning to our third pillar of our strategy, providing increased opportunities for player investment. This quarter, excluding deferrals, we drove a record $1 billion in digital in-game content sales, a rapidly growing part of our business. A big driver of that performance was King, which continued to drive large audiences of over 400 million monthly active users who invest increasing amounts in our games because of the incredibly compelling content King continues to deliver.","As expected, due to seasonality and launch timing, King MAUs were down this quarter, but deeper engagement and player investment in part due to the new initiatives around ongoing live operations and events led again to Candy Crush franchise growth with gross bookings up quarter-over quarter and year-over-year. King's time spent per MAU and average revenue per paying user across the network were both up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Mobile gross bookings for King also increased year-over-year. King has had at least three of the top 15 grossing games in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for ten quarters in a row, showing the durability of top mobile franchises over time.","King has also continued with its in-network advertising tests, which we expect to expand to Candy Crush later this year. The tests are critical to ensuring that engagement in value-added offers can be a virtuous cycle as we've seen with new in-game content in our core games. We believe advertising is an attractive opportunity given the size and quality of King's network and thorough testing is critical to ensure we preserve a high quality play experience and player investment opportunities.","Turning to our core game experiences, we see continued evidence of this virtuous cycle. Strong engagement leads to strong player investment, which in turn fuels strong engagement. Blizzard is a testimony to that. Record engagement in Q2 led to Blizzard's biggest revenue quarter ever. This strong performance was driven by Overwatch successful launch, now with life-to-date franchise revenue excluding deferral at about $0.5 billion. World of Warcraft's strong pre-expansion momentum with Legion III purchases tracking in line with the previous expansion and Hearthstone's double-digit revenue growth behind the successful launch of the Old Gods expansion.","The teams at Activision and Bungie continued to successfully introduce new earned and purchased in-game content into Destiny. We've seen strong community response to this content with no reduction in engagement. Finally, Call of Duty has seen strong performance across the board. In-game content purchases including season pass, map packs, and micro-transactions continued to deliver at record levels for the franchise. In fact, on the back of the strength, as well as strong catalog sales, the first half of the year was the best in terms of both non-GAAP operating income and revenue in the franchise's history. Activision also doubled the number of in-game purchases in Call of Duty with no degradation to average revenue per user. Most importantly, this was accomplished while actually improving overall engagement.","The bold innovations in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare got exceptionally positive media sentiment at E3, including being named best shooter by Game Informer and receiving 25 other awards and distinctions. Activision is taking a different approach to the Collector's Edition this year with the best bonus content we have ever offered. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. The Legacy Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition offer an amazing value and incredible breadth and variety of gameplay. Infinite Warfare offers three full modes which will deliver bold, new innovations for the franchise and the beautiful remaster of Modern Warfare will return fans to the classic gameplay of one of the most beloved games in history.","It seems to be a winning combination since we are seeing a far higher percentage of our preorders in our higher value premium SKUs than ever before. While as expected overall preorders are down versus last year, Activision is taking a different approach to the marketing cadence this year which is more backloaded. This has allowed for increased focus on driving Black Ops III engagement, which given the record first half of the year for the franchise has been a fruitful strategy.","As a result, the majority of the assets for this year's launch including Infinite Warfare's multiplayer reveal and hands-on, Zombies reveal and hands-on, and Modern Warfare Remastered multiplayer and hands-on are all yet to be revealed. This sets the stage for next month's Call of Duty XP which will provide the perfect stage to showcase all of this incredible content to drive momentum as we enter the launch season and of course to celebrate Call of Duty's amazing fans.","In summary, our strong performance in the first half of the year confirmed that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off and we have a great schedule of content for the balance of the year. Dennis?","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Thomas. It's been an incredible first half of the year and across nearly all parts of our business we saw strong performance in the quarter. This performance further validates many of the important growth themes we've discussed around opportunities in mobile, digital, fee-per-player investment and our ability to launch new world-class intellectual property.","Before we go into the results as a reminder, we hosted a quick call last week to discuss changes to our external non-GAAP reporting in response to the SEC staff's updated interpretations. And I'd encourage you to review those materials if you haven't done so already. These interpretations affect external reporting for numerous companies but do not affect our strong underlying business fundamentals or cash flows. As we explained, starting this quarter, we will be sharing some reporting metrics and we will continue to provide you with supplemental disclosure to help you calculate relevant metrics for year-over-year comparisons. Our disclosures can be found in the tables in our earnings press release and the Excel model posted to the IR website following this call.","Turning to our Q2 results in highlights, we will now for one last time refer to our non-GAAP results as we have previously defined them, excluding deferrals. We generated revenues of $1.61 billion in the quarter, $234 million above May guidance and $850 million or 112% above Q2 last year. We generated EPS of $0.54, $0.16 above guidance and $0.41 or 315% above Q2 last year. The over performance versus guidance was composed of $0.04 of cost timing and $0.12 of business over performance, with the key drivers being the successful launch of our newest franchise, Overwatch, which is obviously off to a resounding start, continued momentum of the Call of Duty digital business and continued growth of the Candy Crush franchise.","In addition, digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver in Q2, producing record quarterly digital revenues and operating margins for the company. Digital revenues were $1.4 billion, growing 129% year-over-year and 76% quarter over quarter, and as Thomas mentioned, a remarkable $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales. Excluding King, digital revenues were also up a record \u2013 up over 50% year-over-year. Our digital performance drove operating margins to a Q2 record of 37%, up from 28% operating margin last quarter and 23% in Q2 of last year. So we have continued strong tailwinds on the digital front which bodes well for the future across the business.","Now let's take a look at the business results for each of our three segments. Let's start with Blizzard. The launch of Overwatch drove engagement to record highs, leading to their biggest revenue quarter ever with quarterly operating income that was nearly triple Q2 of last year. Blizzard also had its biggest quarter in China with the meaningful increase in revenues versus the previous high last year. World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch success in Asia shows the depth of Blizzard's resonance in important growth markets.","Overwatch was the fastest selling PC game ever in China, and the Warcraft film had the biggest Hollywood launch ever in China as well. On the Activision front, the team delivered record MAUs and operating income for both Q2 and the first half of the year, driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty and in particular, digital in-game content. Turning to King, the Candy Crush franchise continues to perform well showing growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. King's Q2 segment operating income was also up quarter over quarter on a full quarter basis.","With all that as a backdrop, let's now turn to our detailed financial results and to our updated external reporting format. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Please note non-GAAP redefined includes deferrals. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion, up 50% year-over-year, an operating margin of 15% and EPS of $0.17. For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis as redefined to include deferrals, we generated an operating margin of 31% and EPS of $0.45, up 45% year-over-year.","Turning to the specific P&L items, please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q2, GAAP product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 60%, interest expense was $65 million and our GAAP tax rate was 24%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 753 million shares including participating securities. On a non-GAAP basis as redefined, which includes deferrals, product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 45%, interest expense was $64 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 18%. In terms of cash flow, in Q2 we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $511 million, up 37% year-over-year, operating cash flow of $479 million, up 255% year-over-year and free cash flow of $435 million after CapEx, up 307% year over year with continued strong cash conversion. For the first half of the year, we delivered $788 million of operating cash flow, up 129% year-over-year and $717 million of free cash flow, up 143% year-over-year.","Turning to the balance sheet, on the back of that strong cash flow performance, we ended June 30 with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments, of which roughly one-third was held domestically. We also paid down $816 million of our outstanding debt in the quarter, bringing the total pay down so far this year to $1.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in aggregate debt outstanding. Please note that our $1.5 billion of 2021 notes become callable during the third quarter of 2016. In light of our recent upgrade to investment-grade, we believe it will be advantageous to call the bonds and refinance that debt during the quarter. As such we've included the call premium and estimated transaction costs in our GAAP guidance for Q3. On the dividend front, in Q2 we paid a $0.26 per share cash dividend, or approximately $195 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2016.","So in summary, Q2 and our first half were an incredibly strong start of the year for the company and set us up well for the upcoming quarters and years ahead.","Now, let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and full year 2016. Blizzard is launching Hearthstone's next adventure, One Night in Karazhan next week, and launching World of Warcraft's next expansion, Legion, globally on August 30. Activision is launching Destiny's Rise of Iron expansion on September 20 at the $30 price point as well as a map pack for Call of Duty Black Ops III in Q3. We expect Skylanders Imaginators to launch on October 16, followed by Skylanders Academy, an animated show which is expected to debut on Netflix.","In Q4, Activision also plans to release the fourth map pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops III as well as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered on November 4. King launched Farm Heroes Super Saga in the last few days of Q2 and has one more non-Candy Crush franchise release coming towards the end of the year, along with continued live operations across key games and franchises.","For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.49 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $45 million, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $138 million, which includes the potential payment of a call premium and related debt refinancing costs, a GAAP tax rate of 18%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 760 million, and EPS of $0.06. For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $53 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, including a GAAP deferral of $0.01. Note that you can reference our company materials for the FX rates we use in our guidance.","Now, let's turn to our full year 2016 numbers. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million, product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $311 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 18%, including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard for simplification for share-based compensation. Please see our outlook tables in the earnings release for additional detail.","We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.87, up $0.18 versus our previous guidance. As we said on our prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related adjustments, costs and amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results.","For 2016 on a non-GAAP basis as redefined, we expect product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 44%, operating margin of 32% and a tax rate of 24%. Our non-GAAP interest expense is expected to be $223 million. Based on the information we disclosed in May, our non-GAAP redefined outlook was $1.64, including $0.14 of deferrals. We are now raising our non-GAAP redefined EPS outlook to $1.83, which includes $0.07 of GAAP deferrals. If you would like to calculate non-GAAP as previously defined revenues and EPS, in order to do year-over-year comparisons, you would add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues into non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted.","So in summary, our performance in Q2 and in the first half of the year once again proved our ability to achieve three important things: first, to launch new content that can appeal to millions of players around the world; second, to consistently keep our large audiences engaged as we offer them more frequent digital content and services to enhance their experiences; and third, to deliver solid financial results which further sets us up for long-term success. As such, as a team we are very pleased with our first-half momentum and couldn't be more excited as we head into the back half of the year.","Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon and congrats on a strong quarter. I was wondering if you could provide some color on the monetization around Overwatch. Title seems to be a strong example of the change in the industry model from just kind of selling units to generating an ongoing digital ARPU from full-game downloads to cosmetic add-on content to other future DLCs. Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - President and Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi. This is Mike from Blizzard. Thanks for the question. First, we're very pleased with Overwatch's launch results. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our 15 million players around the world who've joined Overwatch so far. We really appreciate all their support and their incredible enthusiasm for the game. We've seen great momentum with the game across all the different engagement models, including digital and box sales, Korean Internet Game Rooms, which are time based, and cosmetic content, which can be earned or purchased.","As Thomas mentioned, altogether, the game has generated about $0.5 billion life to date, excluding deferrals. But more importantly, in the past two months since launch, we've already provided some great content to the Overwatch community including a competitive play mode, a new hero, the recently launched Summer Games content, which drove record engagement yesterday as well as customization items. So, we're very excited about creating even more content for players moving forward.","I also want to point out that while we had a great start with the game release, we really view this as just the beginning. We think we've created a strong character driven universe with big opportunities beyond just the game. We think Overwatch has strong potential as an esport. The recently announced Overwatch World Cup, which will take place at BlizzCon this year is a good first taste of that, but we'll be talking more about our Overwatch esports plans later in the year. We also look forward to telling more stories about the characters in the world of Overwatch through other media. You've seen some of this through the animated shorts and comics, but there's still more to come.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. Just wondering if Pok\u00e9mon Go has had any impact on King games, and if you're seeing any learnings from its success out there. Thank you.","Riccardo Zacconi - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Brian. It's Riccardo here. So in terms of impact on the King games, we have not seen any meaningful impact on the network to date. What we see is that the core audience continues to stay very engaged with over 30-minute plays per day in average. As Thomas was mentioning earlier, the Candy Crush franchise has grown not only quarter on quarter but also year on year. And it is really testimony to not only to the longevity but also to the strength of the brand.","In terms of learnings, Pok\u00e9mon Go has been very successful in expanding the mobile games audience. They have brought the large Pok\u00e9mon fan base to mobile. And I believe this is very good for the whole gaming industry. What it has also proven is that when you pair innovation to very strong branded IP, there is a huge potential. And so I think this is actually very good, and it's a great opportunity for Activision Blizzard on mobile.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hey, thanks. I wonder as we go through the launching plan and the launch of Call of Duty, if you could give a little color on how those are coming along, both Infinite Warfare and the Remastered version. I think you mentioned that preorders of the higher ARPU SKUs are the best you've ever had. Could you maybe comment on the digital SKU factored into that? Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg - Chief Executive Officer of Activision, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Doug. It's Eric. I'll take the question. So first of all, on the quality, both of the games, both Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered are really looking amazing, and we're very excited that we found a way to deliver both the breakthrough innovation that has been such an important part of Call of Duty's success over the years as well as a return to the classic gameplay that people love so much in one amazing package at an incredible value, and that combination, that value has really led to the performance that we're seeing in the preorders for both the Legacy Edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition, both of which are kind of registering far higher percentages for our higher priced SKUs than we have ever seen before.","So the way we think about it is that Modern Warfare Remastered is the best bonus content we have ever offered in one of our Collector's Editions and we think that's driving that player performance for both the Legacy Edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition. On Infinite Warfare, specifically, the team at Infinity Ward is just tremendously passionate about the game and that passion is really showing through and how the game is closing. It's fresh, it's inventive, it looks great and it has a ton of new gameplay mechanics for the franchise. There's often initial skepticism when you push for bold innovations in the context of something that's so well-established as Call of Duty, but the good news is the more people are seeing at the game the more they're getting really excited about it.","We showed eight uninterrupted moments of gameplay at E3 and that generated the highest positive sentiment from the usually hard to please gamer press that we've ever seen on the franchise at E3 since we've been measuring it. And we showed another 12 minutes of gameplay at Comic-Con and again got the highest positive sentiment from the press we've ever seen for Call of Duty at that event. The reason that's particularly good news is because people actually haven't seen that much of this game yet relative to previous years.","As Thomas mentioned, we're taking a little bit of a different approach to the marketing this year centered around Call of Duty XP, and that's both allowed us to focus on Black Ops 3, which I'll just deliver that record first half of the year that Thomas mentioned, but it's also allowing us to put all eyes on our launch titles in September at XP, where we will have a pretty incredible list of reveals and first hands-on including things like multiplayer in Infinite Warfare, multiplayer in Modern Warfare Remastered, the first zombies mode in the main game that we've had in an entr\u00e9e art title with Infinite Warfare as well as more reveals on Campaign as well. And for context, all of the modes had been revealed at this time last year. So we think we've got a winning combination, I think we've got a great game of Infinite Warfare and a second great game with Modern Warfare Remastered.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Taylor with Arcadia Investment Corporation. Please go ahead.","John G. Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corp.","Hi. Congrats on a great quarter. I had a question, I think we're all kind of hungry for some metrics on engagement or monetization trends with some of your big brands and I was just wondering maybe you could talk a little bit about Destiny specifically and talk about what you've been seeing lately with that audience and then give us an update on what's going on with Rise of Iron and what we should expect there? Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg - Chief Executive Officer of Activision, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure. Hey. It's Eric again. So as I mentioned on the last call, our biggest challenge on Destiny has not been generating demand for more content from our communities. It's actually been our ability to keep up with that demand, and I'm happy to say that we've made real progress working together with Bungie on that front and as a result, in addition to the update that we've already had this year that drove increased engagement, we also have an awesome expansion coming on September 20 with Rise of Iron.","As I think Thomas mentioned, pre-purchases and preorders on Rise of Iron are actually ahead of last year's expansion The Taken King, which is evidence of the continued passionate engagement for this game and this universe from our community, and we'll also have more updates planned for this year to continue to keep people engaged. As for the future, the majority of the team at Bungie is actually focused entirely on creating Destiny 2, which is still on track for release next year and it's going to be awesome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think you guys talked about having record operating income on certain franchises. Wanted to know how we should think about overall core Activision Blizzard operating income moving from kind of the low to mid 30% range to kind of higher 30% or maybe even 40% range excluding King? What are some of the levers you can push on the revenue side as well as on the cost side to get there? Thanks.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, hey, Neil. It's Dennis. Thanks for the question. On a consolidated basis, we had Q2 record 37% operating margin, which is non-GAAP as previously defined. And in fact, Activision Publishing and Blizzard, those two segments combined were above that at 39% in terms of operating margin this past quarter. So you have and can see some of the sight lines to how we might get there and then try to sustain that over time.","I'd probably call out maybe three things that are really key for that, and that are going to be really important for us to get to those levels and to sustain them going forward. The first one is just scale. In our business, we have a large opportunity to drive upside once we recover the fixed spend that we have to bring our games and our content to market, being very focused on how we do that and all the costs enable us to really scale those incremental margins as we do that. And it's a combination of those that once you get past that fixed cost base, really drives margin accretion for every incremental sale that you have.","The second part beyond scale is just digital growth, which really has two aspects. The first is just the trend that we're going to continue to see around the shift from retail to digital on full game sales, and that will continue. But even more importantly and a bigger driver as you saw in Q2 is the deeper player investment that we see once we have players inside of our experience and new opportunities to add micro-transactions, advertising, other things into those experiences, which are all really contribution margin and accretive to the overall margin of the company.","And then lastly, I'd just say as a competitive point relative to others, obviously owning our own IP is a huge factor in scaling those margins. That gives us a huge structural margin advantage relative to others and really gives us the flexibility to respond quickly as business models evolve and it'll help us build long-term value around our margin structure. So I'd say those are probably the three things that are most important to driving that. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you. I just have one for Ricardo. So you guys have been testing some mobile ads on King, and maybe can you just talk about some of the learnings that you've seen there so far? And I believe also you're looking to sell King ads mostly on a direct basis with a sales force. So I guess maybe could you also talk about why the direct sales model makes the most sense rather than say programmatic, and where you are in the process of hiring a sales force to ramp up direct sales by next year? Thanks.","Riccardo Zacconi - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Chris. Nice talking to you again, Christopher. And before I get to your questions, I just want to reiterate that because of the size of the network and the engagement of our players, we believe that advertising represents an attractive opportunity. So as you said, at the same time, as you know, we are extremely focused on providing a first and foremost a great user experience. And we will not compromise on this. So this is the key reason why we are testing extremely thoroughly and are taking time for testing in-depth. And currently we are testing in two games, and we expect to test also in Candy Crush later this year as Thomas was saying earlier.","Besides testing, we are also hiring and we are hiring as selectively as we are hiring in the company, and we are hiring to bring the right experience to build this business for the long term.","And in regards to the other question you had, the sales model, we are focusing not only on direct sales, but we will sell both programmatic and direct. So I hope I answered your questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wonder if you'd be willing to expound on your commentary concerning presales activity for Legion. The impact you've seen from the movie release, has that been more short lived or more sustainable in terms of the sub base? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - President and Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks for the question. This is Mike. We've seen very positive trends with the game over the past month. That's a result of the excitement building up to the Legion launch and also as a result of the positive attention we've seen globally with the Warcraft movie. While we have good momentum everywhere, the uplift in China has been particularly strong. So we have double-digit growth in engagement compared to a year ago and last quarter. And while there's several weeks to go until the Legion launch, our presales have been tracking in line with the prior expansion. So we have good strong momentum heading into next week, where we're going to be releasing the Demon Hunter and then following that, the Expansion launch later in the month.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I'll add my congratulations on a great quarter. Obviously, we're hearing a lot more about esports this year from you as well as other publishers. I wonder if your expectations are changing in terms of what you've seen thus far, but on the timeframe to ramp esports to material revenue contributor and longer term, how much in terms of potential incremental revenue and profit you could expect from that. Thank you.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So I think the important thing, Colin, for us is that, all of our esports initiatives are in the service of celebrating our players. And you think about the investment and the commitment that our players make in our games, this is a great way for us to really recognize through organized competition being that investment.","When you look at all the opportunities that present themselves, they're very franchise specific. There's a lot of work that needs to be done to get to a place where you have broad appeal watching, where you have the ability to broadcast content in an effective and successful way. And we're investing again all of the various opportunities that we think esports could present. It's a longer-term vision for what we're trying to accomplish. There's a lot of investment that's still going to be required.","Having said that, more people are spectating on video games than ever before. There are more opportunities for spectators than ever before. The live event competitions are providing greater prize pools, greater recognition, greater opportunities for players. And we think that this is one of the areas that'll present great opportunities for us for the long-term.","Getting from here to a place that will allow our franchises to resemble the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, is going to take some time, but I could tell you the best minds of the company, the people who are in this room are all committed to continuing the efforts that we've made. And I think we have a genuine belief that in all of these sports, we've been the most successful. I think most of what you see is organized competition started out with Blizzard games a long time ago. And so we have a lot of belief and a lot of expectation that the promise of esports will continue to be something that we will excel at.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","All right. Thanks, Bobby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you again on our next call in early November.","Operator","Thank you.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Amrita Ahuja, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Amrita Ahuja","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 conference call. With us are Bobby Kotick, CEO; Coddy Johnson, President and COO; and Spencer Neumann, CFO. And for Q&A, Dennis Durkin, Chief Corporate Officer; Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the Company as of the date of this presentation, and while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.","A number of things could cause the Company\u2019s actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings, including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and those on the slide that is showing. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, February 8, 2018.","We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call. We provide non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, expenses, including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment; expenses related to debt financings and refinancings; restructuring charges and the associated tax benefits of these excluded items along with significant discreet tax related items such as those results from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.","These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures.","There\u2019s also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview, highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary sheet.","Starting this quarter, we are introducing a new operating metric, net bookings. Net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period and is equal to revenues plus the impacts from deferrals.","And now, I\u2019d like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Bobby Kotick","Thanks, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us today.","This was a record quarter and record year for Activision Blizzard. We delivered record quarterly net bookings of $2.6 billion and record annual net bookings of $7.2 billion. We delivered record segment operating income of $2.4 billion and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.21 per share, above our initial February outlook of $1.70. And we also delivered record annual operating cash flow of $2.2 billion.","Each part of our business reached new milestones and demonstrated the durable and enduring nature of our franchises. Activision celebrated strong Call of Duty momentum and their best operating income year ever. Blizzard delivered their highest operating income ever for year with no major game releases. And King returned to growth with the Candy Crush franchise stronger than ever.","2017 was also an important year for us for preparation of our future growth initiatives. We invested in new services, features, content and experiences to connect and engage audiences all across our franchises. One example is the launch of the Overwatch League. Witnessing the passion of players at the opening matches of Blizzard Arena and the millions of spectators connecting via live stream from around the world was a thrilling moment in our history and a milestone in esports growth. Watching fans road trip across the country, spectators in the stands wearing team jerseys, gears in the game wearing team skins, audiences leaping to their feet after daily play and viewing parties around the world; these were awesome moments that created incredibly rewarding experience and demonstrated the emergence of professional competition as a way to celebrate our players.","Launching a professional league is an ambitious undertaking and our teams executed on countless fronts, attracting 12 world-class team owners representing cities in Asia, Europe and North America, signing numerous league and team level sponsors, brining esports spectating and production values to new heights, and forming a media strategy that provides broad reach and fair value for our premium content while also preserving distribution on own platforms.","Overwatch League matches are broadcast live on our MLG and Twitch, and will be available on other broadcast outlets throughout the world. In its first week, the league reached 10 million unique viewers and had more than 280,000 average viewers on a per minute basis, in the week since we\u2019ve seen sustained levels of viewership globally with new spectators joining each week as the excitement continues to grow.","Of course, we are building this league for the long term, and we\u2019re pleased with the early strong momentum that we have which has created value for players, spectators, team owners, partners and sponsors. Our efforts have already led to increased global demand for expansion teams, which we expect to start selling later this year.","We also believe in the growth potential of each new opportunity we are pursuing whether in-game advertising, consumer products, cinematic productions or esports, all of these support our communities and help to drive engagement with our franchises. Each new experience we provide that enables our players to demonstrate their passion, creates a virtuous cycle of engagement, investment and growth. It\u2019s still early days for many of these efforts but making progress in these strategic growth areas will be an important focus for us in 2018 and beyond.","I have the privilege to lead one of the best teams in the entire business world. And as I begin my 28th year at helm, I have never been more energized to pursue with focus and determination the great growth opportunities that lie ahead.","Also, this quarter, we announced that Reveta Bowers joined our Board of Directors, Reveta brings an immense amount of experience and leadership from education and media institutions such as Common Sense Media where she chairs the National Board of Directors and from The Walt Disney Company where she served as a director for 10 years. We\u2019re thrilled to have her as our newest Board member.","And now, here is Coddy, to review the highlights of our operations this quarter.","Coddy Johnson","Thank you, Bobby.","Activision Blizzard had a record year. And throughout 2017, we broke records and posted strong results each quarter by providing an ongoing year-round scheme of content, services, features and events, both large and small, to our passionate and deeply engaged communities. While achieving these records, we also made important investments to drive future growth. We invested in marketing, to grow our franchise reach, and used services and features to enable more audience engagement and player investment and in new growth verticals to celebrate our fans.","Let\u2019s dive into our first strategic pillar, audience reach, which was 385 million monthly active users this quarter, up from 384 million in Q3. Starting with King. On our last call, we discussed a number of initiatives underway to stabilize King\u2019s user base. Those ongoing efforts include releasing fresh and compelling features, events and content into the live games, ROI positive marketing to attract and engage new players, and a strong pipeline of new titles to expand the network. Several of these initiatives enabled King to finish Q4 with 290 million monthly active users and to grow time spent per user to a record of 37 minutes. The Candy Crush franchise in particular was up in monthly active users quarter-over-quarter, while also driving increased engagement with higher daily active users and higher time spent per player.","Activision had the top grossing console game releases in North America and two of the top five worldwide, getting at 55 million monthly active users in Q4, up double digits quarter-over-quarter and matching the prior quarterly record.","Call of Duty: World War II was the top grossing console game worldwide in 2017, making it the number one franchise globally, a spot that franchise has held for eight of the last nine years. Call of Duty: World War II also set a new franchise milestone with the biggest launch quarter sell-through on current-gen consoles, higher even than Black Ops III. The game also set a PlayStation record as the biggest day one digital release ever. We\u2019ve seen a steady march upward effort on full game downloads for Call of Duty over the last several years, and there\u2019s plenty of runway still ahead. All of this sound performance coupled with a great Black Ops III digital season earlier in the year, means that the most successful video game franchise over the last 20 years continues to be healthy and vibrant and will carry strong momentum into 2018.","To that end, this fall, we plan to continue to exceed fans\u2019 expectations with the new release from Activision\u2019s Treyarch, the creators of Black Ops, the most successful sub-franchise in Call of Duty history, and we cannot wait to share more about that with you on future calls.","Turning now to Destiny. Destiny 2 had an impressive launch, highly rated and second to Call of Duty as the highest grossing consoles in North America in 2017. It added a critically acclaimed PC version with distribution offered at Battle.net, [ph] and the attach rate of Destiny 2\u2019s first expansion released in December was higher than that of Destiny 1.","That said, we haven\u2019t yet sustainably expanded Destiny community. The Bungie is hard at work improving the game. And the good news is that the Destiny community is a deeply committed, vocal passionate player base, as they responded [ph] in the past when we made improvements based on their sentiments. To that end, last week, Bungie released an update outlining what the changes we made and the changes that are coming. So far, these changes have been received positively and the team has a robust slate of services, features and seasonal events still to come. There are also two epic adventures on the horizon with expansion 2 in May and a major content launch later this year. There is magic in this franchise and we\u2019re committed to meeting our own and our players\u2019 expectations in the coming quarters.","Crash Bandicoot continued to have strong sales in Q4 after a successful summer launch. Crash\u2019s performance shows how valuable our library of IP can be, and brought back players in the compelling new way. We look forward to growing other beloved IP in future offerings as well.","Blizzard is celebrating its 27th anniversary today. Happy birthday, Blizzard. A lot of things have changed over the past 27 years as the business has grown across genres, platforms and geographies but a few things have not including Blizzard\u2019s commitment to put players first and to release games at an incredibly high level of quality. Blizzard finished the year with 40 million monthly active users, continuing a sixth quarter streak of 40 million monthly active users or more.","Overwatch continued to attract new players in the most recent Blizzard World content and it\u2019s been well received by the community. Overwatch\u2019s model of delivering year-round content with seasonal events and new heroes and new maps continues to drive strong engagement.","Hearthstone\u2019s monthly active users increased year-over-year this quarter as players enjoyed the latest expansion, Kobolds and Catacombs and the introduction of new free content. While net bookings did not match the prior expansion\u2019s record performance, players did log more play time, which brings me to our second strategic pillar, deepening the engagement. For Activision Blizzard and King overall, daily time spent per user was over 50 minutes for the second quarter in a row, placing us on par with Facebook\u2019s time per day across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Now, that 50 minutes per day is just the time spent in our games; it does not include the growing popularity of watching our games on other online platforms.","For the year, Activision Blizzard had seven of the top 20 games on Twitch; the next closest publisher had just two, demonstrating the broad esports appeal of our franchises. Bobby already shared that launching of the Overwatch League was a key milestone for us and that we\u2019re seeing strong early momentum. And Call of Duty World League also opened its next season in December and is off to a good start selling out each of its World League Global Open events. And the season\u2019s launch event more than doubled viewership hours over the prior year.","Turning now to our third pillar, player engagement. In-game services, features and content continue to engage our fans and help drive our results, delivering a Q4 record of over $1 billion of in-game net bookings and an annual record of over $4 billion. We focus on offering compelling content for our communities wherever they play. Activision had some of the industry\u2019s best selling downloadable content in 2017 including Zombies Chronicles for Call of Duty: Black Ops III which was been the number one add-on offering of the year for PlayStation North America. This is notable and impressive given that Chronicles came out nearly two years after Black Ops III launch and illustrates the value of releasing great content to our engaged communities wherever they are playing.","Just as impressively, player investment in additional virtual goods and services surpassed investment in downloadable content in 2017 for Call of Duty and for Destiny, and we expect that to be the same for 2018. Activision has a great digital roadmap ahead including Destiny 2\u2019s expansion pass and Call of Duty: World War II\u2019s season pass.","King was the biggest contributor to our record year of in-game net bookings. King continues to have two of the top-10 grossing games on U.S. iOS and Android app stores, a level of performance they delivered for over four years now. For the first time, King actually held both the number one and the number two spots at same time of Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga, respectively, demonstrating their remarkable durability in the Candy Crush franchise.","Overall, King had an incredible year in 2017, delivering not only four straight quarters of growth in consumer spend on Candy Crush but also a new mobile net bookings record with their biggest year, their best quarter in Q3 and their best week ever in Q4.","Finally, we continue to make progress on our Company-wide mobile pipeline. We are hard at work on initiatives across a number of our franchises. We plan to see some early results later this year, and for the bulk of our new mobile opportunities to be driving growth in 2019 and beyond.","In summary, 2017 was our best year yet because of the broad-based success we delivered and because of the groundwork we laid to realize significant growth in years ahead. We have a great slate on the road, [ph] for 2018 and beyond. And we look forward to continuing to serve our passionate fans, communities, and audiences are the world.","Spence will now review the 2017 numbers in more detail and discuss 2018 guidance. Spence?","Spencer Neumann","Thanks, Coddy.","So, today, I\u2019ll our review our Q4 and 2017 results as well as our outlook for 2018. Q4 was another strong quarter capping off a record-setting year, with record quarterly and annual revenues driven by record annual digital revenues as our business is now 78% digital and record in-game revenues consistent with our entertainment as a service model. With an increasingly diversified business, we generated for the first time over $2 billion in annual revenues on each of three interactive platforms, console, PC, and mobile, and with record profits, record annual non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share, and record cash flows. Each of Activision Blizzard and King contributed to our over-performance for the year, delivering record annual total segment revenues and operating income. And as Bobby noted, this was without the benefit of a new full game release from Blizzard, underscoring the strength of our continuous engagement model.","Activision had an impressive fourth quarter, capping off their best year ever with segment records for operating income of over $1 billion and operating margin of over 38%. Activision\u2019s performance was driven primarily by the resurgence of the Call of Duty franchise with the successful launch of Call of Duty: World War II, as well as strong sales for Crash Bandicoot. Q4 segment revenues and operating income increased 16% and 32% over prior year respectively, with the full year growing at similarly strong rates.","King had an outstanding year with revenue and operating income up 7% and 12%, respectively, on a pro forma basis that includes the 2016 pre-acquisition period for King. This is a major accomplishment. It\u2019s testament to the strong execution of the King team, their increased prioritization on the Candy Crush franchise and other live titles, and their intense focus on leveraging their platform to drive continuous improvements in engagement, game features and player investment. While margins expanded year-over-year, we did see some compression in Q4 as King strategically invested in marketing live titles to profitably drive reach.","Blizzard also delivered a $2.1 billion of revenue and $712 million of operating income. Blizzard generated record results for the year with no major game release, fueled by a steady stream of content and events across their franchises, in particular Overwatch, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft. Revenue, operating income and segment operating income margin were down year-over-year as expected given the difficult comps to last year\u2019s World of Warcraft expansion and Overwatch release. We did see some incremental margin compression in Q4, primarily due to additional marketing initiatives. Nonetheless, with 33% full-year OI margins, the team did a nice job delivering the core business while investing in key growth initiatives across the Overwatch League, mobile incubation and MLG network.","Now, before I turn to our consolidated results and 2018 guidance, a brief note on U.S. tax reform. Our 2017 GAAP results include incremental expense of $794 million due to the impact of significant discreet tax-related items, primarily related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December of 2017. The charge related to tax reform is a reasonable estimate but is preliminary and includes a onetime tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we expect a reduction in our future effected tax rate which we will reflect in our 2018 guidance. We\u2019ll also now have repatriation opportunities for our international cash that enable more efficient global cash management and capital structure flexibility.","So, now, let\u2019s turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I\u2019ll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated record GAAP revenues of $2.04 billion, $343 million above our November guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of $597 million. As already mentioned, this quarter we are introducing a new operating metric, net bookings which were a record $2.64 billion. We had a GAAP loss per share of $0.77 including a $1.03 expense from the impact of the significant discreet tax-related items that I just mentioned. Adjusted to exclude these discreet tax related items, we would have delivered earnings per diluted share of $0.27, ahead of our guidance of $0.10. We had non-GAAP EPS of $0.49 in Q4, ahead of guidance of $0.36. And both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS figures include net deferrals of $0.45.","For the year, we generated record GAAP revenues of $7.02 billion, as $1 billion above our initial 2017 guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of the $139 million. Net bookings were a record $7.16 billion. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.36, which includes $1.04 expense from the impact of discreet tax-related items in Q4. Excluding the discreet tax-related items, we would have delivered record GAAP EPS this year of $1.39, ahead of initial guidance last February of $0.72. We generated record non-GAAP EPS of $2.21, ahead of our initial guidance last February of $1.70. These figures include net deferrals of $0.07.","So, now, looking at cash flow and capital structure. Our strong business performance for the year also delivered record annual operating cash flow of $2.21 billion and Q4 operating cash flow of $1.16 billion, finishing the year with approximately $4.8 billion in cash and investments. With regard to capital structure, we had positive development throughout the year and continue to take a balanced approach overall. In Q2, we received another upgrade from S&P to BBB and entered into a leverage neutral $1.2 billion refinancing that locked-in attractive long-term interest rates. We paid down $500 million in debt and finished the year with approximately $4.44 billion of aggregate debt outstanding, and we increased our annual dividend 15% to $0.30, paying out $226 million to shareholders in May.","Now, we are heading into 2018 with the strong balance sheet and additional flexibility. We ended the year with a net cash position of $335 million. And as discussed, the recent tax reform allows us to repatriate the cash we\u2019re holding overseas, more efficiently. This year, we\u2019ll once again take a balanced approach to capital allocation. Our Board has authorized a 13% increase in our dividend to $0.34 per share, payable in May, and further debt pay down of over $1 billion. In addition, our $1 billion stock repurchase authorization remains in effect for another year.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our outlook for 2018, but before doing so -- before I review the numbers, I wanted to quickly discuss ASC 606 and its impact on our guidance. While ASC 606 will affect our GAAP revenue recognition, it\u2019s not expected to materially impact our annual segment results, cash flows or financial performance, as reviewed for internal management purposes. We do expect that there\u2019ll be some quarterly movements within the year. So, please refer to the investor FAQ we\u2019ve provided on our website for more information on ASC 606.","Now, turning to our 2018 slate. From an operating income perspective, we expect each of our segment to grow in 2018. While we also continue invest in new releases, mobile pipeline and our future growth initiatives including advertising, esports leagues and MLG network. We expect in-game revenues to be a primary driver of our growth for both the top and bottom line. Coming off a record year in 2017, we expect in-game net bookings to grow by a double-digit percentage in 2018 as we continue to innovate and deliver more engaging content to our players.","Now, given the timing of launches in 2018 and the continued ramp of our new initiatives, we expect our performance to be further weighted to the back half of the year relative to what we saw in 2017. We expect Blizzard to grow year-over-year with the release of World of Warcraft\u2019s Battle for Azeroth this summer. I am glad to say the presales for Azeroth kicked off last week and are off to an encouraging start. In addition, Blizzard has exciting plans for live ops and additional in-game content across franchises, including Hearthstone\u2019s three expansions in 2018 and Overwatch\u2019s in-game events. Blizzard will also start to see the benefit of its investment initiatives, as we expect the Overwatch League to be profitable in 2018, its first full year of operations.","We expect Activision to grow modestly year-over-year, driven primarily by Call of Duty\u2019s digital season of content and the exciting new release planned for Q4. As Coddy mentioned, Activision and Bungie are hard at work on Destiny 2 to improve the in-game engagement through regular updates and events, which we anticipate will benefit performance later this year with the release of a new expansion in May and a major expansion in the second half of the year. And we expect King to be up year-over-year, driven by ongoing live operations across the portfolio, and two or more new releases during the year including social casino.","As we\u2019ve indicated on prior calls, we\u2019ll begin to ramp our ad business in 2018. We expect the minor positive profit contribution weighted towards the back half of the year as we continue to roll out additional video ad products, methodically develop capabilities and infrastructure, and build the business for the significant opportunity that we see over the long term.","Now, turning to numbers for guidance. On a GAAP basis, for 2018, we expect revenues of $7.35 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $100 million. We expect record net bookings of $7.45 billion. We expect product costs of 22%, operating expenses of 53%. Our GAAP net interest expense is expected to be $136 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20%. We expect 776 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.78.","For 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 44%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $95 million and we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 20%. We also expect non-GAAP EPS of $2.45, including a GAAP deferral of $0.05.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.82 billion including GAAP deferrals of negative $540 million. We expect net bookings of $1.28 billion, growing year-over-year. We expect product costs of 20%, operating expenses of 53%, and our GAAP net interest expense is expected to be $30 million, our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20%. We expect 771 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.47.","For Q1 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs of 20%, operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $29 million, a tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 including a GAAP deferral of negative $0.34.","In closing, in 2017, our inspired teams across Activision, Blizzard and King demonstrated the enduring nature of our franchises. We believe the combination of leading owned IP and franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class content capabilities and creative excellence, geographic platform and business model diversity, and continued fiscal disciplined, focus and business prioritization provide an incredibly powerful engine for sustained financial performance, driving meaningful growth in 2018 and beyond.","Now, I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, Riccardo and Dennis as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs.","Chris Merwin","So, this one is for Riccardo. We\u2019ve seen some pretty impressive growth for King, lately. You\u2019ve invested in some more frequent content updates and we\u2019ve seen improved player engagement as a result. But beyond, I guess, the improvements and monetization for King, can you talk a bit more about the pipeline and the two or more new releases in 2018 that you mentioned in the prepared remarks?","Riccardo Zacconi","So, we have several teams working on new games, first of all. And those are games using the existing franchise IP as well as new IP. So, we are creating also new IP. And these games are at various stages of production, and it\u2019s a multiyear pipeline. So, as you heard before, in 2018, we plan to release at least two new games including social casino in partnership with PlayStudios.","I would like to highlight that we set ourselves a very high bar for new game launches. We will only launch games of the highest quality and we\u2019ll only launch them when they\u2019re ready. When we think about games pipeline, it\u2019s not just about new games, it\u2019s also new content for our existing live games where we develop new features and live ops. In 2017, we focused this development on increasing engagement and increasing monetization, and this has allowed us to hit several mobile bookings milestones. As you heard earlier, we had in Q3, our highest-ever mobile bookings quarter, and in Q4, we hit our highest ever mobile booking week.","In 2018, we will continue focusing on engagement and monetization, but we will also focus these new features on rich initiatives. So, we expect to continue to drive positive engagement and monetization as well as we expect to attract new users. So, if I think about it, we exited 2017 with a strong momentum. And I believe that we have a great pipeline, both of new titles and new content for our live games.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Laura Martin with Needham.","Laura Martin","Let\u2019s talk about the Overwatch League. It sounds like everything is going great. Could you sort of give us an update on how it did benchmark against your expectations and what surprised you, both on the upside and downside? And then, on the monetization, as we\u2019re modeling 2018, you said you\u2019re going to sell more teams. Could you talk about monetization generally and then where do you think the teams will sell for more than the first 12 teams?","Mike Morhaime","This Mike from Blizzard. First off, I want to take a moment to thank everyone on the Overwatch League team for the amazing job they\u2019ve done. Overwatch League was an ambitious undertaking, it required supported collaboration across Activision Blizzard starting from the Overwatch game team although up to Bobby who as you know has been a strong supporter of the league from the beginning, as well as from a host of stakeholders and the communities. I want to especially thank all the pro players who compete, the team owners who really got behind our vision for the league, our partners over at Twitch and our sponsors who believed in what we were building. I want to also thank the viewers who tune in especially those people who are coming to the studio and bringing their passion and energy and filling up the stands. They\u2019re an inspiration to everyone who works on Overwatch League. It\u2019s really been wonderful to see how everything has worked out so far. We\u2019re very pleased with the high-quality that we have been able to enjoy every week. The games have been exciting to watch and the reception from our viewers has been really spectacular. So, so far everything has either met or exceeded our expectations.","We made a landmark two-year media rights deal with Twitch and more than 10 million people tuned in to week one, worldwide. We had an impressive audience per minute of over 400,000 on opening day. We\u2019ve also been very happy that several major brands have partnered with Overwatch League including Intel, HP, Toyota, T-Mobile, and Sour Patch Kids.","While we\u2019re pleased, it\u2019s important to note that this is only the beginning. Our focus is going to be on continued growth of the audience through improvements to the broadcast and the live viewer experience. In the mid to long term, we think the audience growth is the key to seeing impact both to the bottom line results and to the Company as a whole, and I think also to drive popularity in the game as well. In terms of selling expansion teams, we are very excited with the reaction and the interest in expansion teams. I\u2019m pretty confident to say that the price is going to go up.","Operator","We will take our next question from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust.","Matthew Thornton","Maybe one for Eric on Destiny 2. Can you kind of give us little more color just on the trends you are seeing around player engagements, in-game monetization, and then, again, little more color just about how you are thinking about the game and the plans for 2018?","Eric Hirshberg","Yes, absolutely, Matt. Happy to talk about Destiny 2. And I want to start just by putting it all in context because we did have a very successful launch of the game. As Coddy mentioned, it was the number two game in North America, the number four game globally, and it was also very well received, it had an A7 rating, that was the full 10 points of improvement over Destiny 1 and it received a 120 awards and nominations. And on top of that we saw a very positive sentiment and new franchise high levels of engagement for the first couple of months post launch. Now after that meaning after players report a significant amount of hours already into the game, we have definitely seen some real sentiment issues surface in a couple of areas, and we got plans to address those. For example, one of the things we wanted to do with Destiny 2 was to make the game a little bit less of a grind based on feedback we heard and we also wanted to provide players with more direct pass to getting the game\u2019s best rewards. And that actually allowed our core players to consume the content faster than we anticipated. And that has led to an increase in players calling for more challenges and better rewards in the ongoing game.","Now, this is a live game, and responding to player feedback is a part of the process in this game and any live game. And we feel we have the right plans in place to address the concern. Last week, Bungie posted a detailed roadmap of the changes that we have coming over the next several months. And thus far, those plans have been very well received as have the changes that we\u2019ve already put into the game itself already and the sentiment is already starting to shift. And also, remember that we have a great expansion coming in May and a major expansion coming at the end of the year. And those events have always been opportunities for us to reengage our community and win back people who have churned out.","This is an incredibly passionate group of players and that passion is a good thing, even when the sentiment is critical because it shows how deeply people care about the game. And we think that\u2019s one of the thing that makes us a great franchise. And we are fully committed to listening to and communicating with our community more frequently and more transparently than ever and making the right changes to improve the experience. And we think we have the right path forward.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tim O\u2019Shea with Jefferies.","TimO\u2019Shea","So, Coddy touched on this in the opening remarks, but I wanted to get a better sense for where Call of Duty finished the year in terms of full game downloads. And then, maybe if you could give us little color on what your expectations are going forward?","Spencer Neumann","See, as you\u2019ll recall, I mentioned last quarter that we\u2019re seeing a consumer-led shift to full game downloads in our console business. It\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve already experienced in the games business on PC platforms, and of course digital transition is not unique to gaming; it\u2019s impacting pretty much every form of entertainment consumption. So, the good news for us is, as I also discussed last call that it\u2019s good for our business; it brings us closer to our consumer and with better economics. So, with that context, Call of Duty finished the year at 30% digital mix. And we mentioned last year that our digital mix was about 20% to 25% on Call of Duty. So, this year\u2019s performance -- it\u2019s essentially in line actually, a bit of an acceleration in that historical 5 percentage-point increase we\u2019ve been seeing the past few years. And I should underscore that these are big absolute numbers, when we\u2019re talking about Call of Duty because it\u2019s such a mass market game. As Coddy mentioned, Call of Duty: World War II is the biggest day one digital release ever of PlayStation, and in aggregate, it represented the biggest Activision digital title ever released on console.","As we look forward, Tim, we\u2019d expect the mix shift in 2018 to be similar to what we saw for Call of Duty this year. It obviously a bit tough to predict with certainty given that it\u2019s ultimately consumer-driven but I know there\u2019re teams that are -- they\u2019re going to continue to innovate with compelling digital offers and other strategies that deliver value to the community and will also continue to support our important retail partners. So, overall, the trends remain strong and they\u2019re positive for our business and the good news is we got quite a bit of runway ahead of us.","Operator","Up next, we have Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Mike Olson","I just have one. You talked about the opportunity for the actual league. But, could you talk about the Overwatch League impact on Overwatch, the game itself, as it relates to engagement, monetization and\/or core game sales?","Mike Morhaime","The Overwatch League has increased overall engagement with the franchise, between viewership and game play. When you consider the hundreds of thousands of fans watching each match and average watch time of over an hour each night, we\u2019re tapping into a whole new avenue for players to express their passion for Overwatch. Of course, there are other positives for the game overall. The Overwatch League has driven a ton of buzz and awareness for the game. And so as that increases, our players have new ways to customize their playing experience with in-game digital skins as well as physical merchandise. And we\u2019ve seen our players respond well to both of those. We\u2019re also looking forward to launching additional initiatives to tie the viewing experience better with the play experience. We think that over the long term, the league will bring in new players as people see the excitement around the league and may even start to train to become the next pro player. Outside of league, we have additional plans to keep Overwatch fresh and players engaged. We already released a new map called Blizzard World in January. We have the Lunar New Year event launching today and there\u2019s additional plans later this year for new heroes and seasonal events to come out. That\u2019s all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brandon Hoffman","Hi. This is Brandon Hoffman on for Brian Nowak. So, you had strong performance from Call of Duty: World War II and there\u2019s excitement about digital in 2018. Can you talk a bit about the CoD pipeline forward?","Bobby Kotick","Absolutely, the CoD pipeline is one of my favorite topics. Before we talk about World War II, I think it\u2019s worth stepping back and talking about how pleased we\u2019re with the Call of Duty franchise overall. Obviously, Call of Duty: World War II was the number one console video game in the world in 2017 and that makes Call of Duty the number one franchise in world eight of the last nine years and the Call of Duty: World War II also delivered the biggest launch quarter we\u2019ve seen on current generation console, even higher than Black Ops III as I think Coddy mentioned. And engagement on World War II has also been strong, not quite as strong we\u2019ve seen from the Black Ops franchise which of course has been our stickiest games but we have seen strong participation with our first two seasonal events, the Winter Siege and the Resistance. And we have actually a more robust calendar of those types of events in the game than we\u2019ve ever had before.","So, our strategy of bringing Call of Duty content to whatever game our fans are choosing to play is really continuing to pay off because also in 2017 we saw that in Black Ops III, the Zombies Chronicles piece was the number one top selling add-on content on PlayStation last year which is more remarkable given that it was released almost few years after the launch of the original game. So that of course sets the stage for the game we have planned later this year which is being developed by our team at Treyarch. Now, as you know, they have developed some of our most successful games ever. And they\u2019ve proven time and again that they know how to keep our players engaged for the long haul.","So, overall, I would say our strategy for Call of Duty is working. World War II is a blockbuster; we\u2019ve got a thriving Black Ops community who is excited for the upcoming Treyarch developed game. And I honestly really wish I could say more about what we have in the pipeline because I\u2019m so excited about it but suffice it say. I think we have the best three-year slate in Call of Duty\u2019s history which is really staying something given this franchise\u2019s history. And I think we\u2019ve got multiple different game universes that we know our players love on tap. So, obviously more to come on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan","I wondered if you could talk a little bit about some of the moves you\u2019ve made, whether it would be investments, acquisitions to position the Company for the advertising opportunity across King. And then, maybe the second one would be how do you think about extending those capabilities or assets across other brands or platforms of the Company in the coming years?","Riccardo Zacconi","Advertising for us is a strategic focus given the opportunity we have with our large and engaged audience. So, we are prioritizing investments across multiple areas. First of all, we are building a world-class team and we are investing in our teams on several dimensions on the ad product, in engineering, in sales and in analytics. And we have already people in place. And this year, we plan to scale these teams further. Second, we are investing in creating great ad products. And by that I mean ad experiences that resonate with our highly engaged players and that are well-integrated into the game play, and also deliver real value to our advertisers. So, to get these right, we have embedded the X [ph] teams within our game teams including in Candy.","So, third, we are investing in our own ad tech infrastructure. In 2017, we\u2019ve seen early success with a dozen of global brands buying advertising across a number of territories in five different games. And we have seen repeat buys as a result of the strong completion and viability metrics.","In 2018, as you heard Spence earlier, we\u2019re expecting only a modest bottom line contribution from ads as we plan to ramp individual ads opportunity, and as we continue to invest in the significant opportunity for the long term. For the second part of the question, I will hand over to Coddy.","Coddy Johnson","I think first, just to step back, and you know that we have several key initiatives underway. We\u2019re building our capability in one area of the business, enables flexibility and option value to bring that capability to other areas of the business over time. Overwatch League could be a great example of this. So, the focus now is completely and solely on Overwatch success. But over time, the professional city-based league approach, infrastructure, the knowhow, the team, the processes, the support structure could logically go on to support other franchises that have strong esports momentum.","And broadly, the way to think about this, Eric, advertising we think is another good example of this. And perhaps specifically, we have the opportunity probably in a couple of areas that are impacting. The first and foremost one is the opportunity that Riccardo just spoke to. Ads for the key mobile network is our primary focus right now. It\u2019s the first step in building our internal ad products, tech deck, team and infrastructure. The second, we do have a near-term opportunity to bring relevant advertising to our esports audiences. We are already off to a good start there with Overwatch League, media rights, sponsorships, advertiser interest, but we see further opportunity in our owned MLG platform. And over time, third, there could be opportunities in other areas of the Company, particularly as we explore ad-based experiences across new games that are suited to that form of media.","If you then just step a little bit back, we have over 50 minutes of engagement per day in our games right now, and that\u2019s not yet including all the time spent watching games in our franchises. So, we think there\u2019s a pretty compelling opportunity to do what you said, which is to be able to bring advertising to other brands and platforms across our network.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc.","Evan Wingren","This is for Mike. Just wondering, what are your expectations for World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth in terms of the size, engagement or any other innovation in the game for this expansion?","Mike Morhaime","So, at Blizzard, we always get excited about new launches. And we in addition to our players are very excited about Battle for Azeroth\u2019s features, which include new Allied Races, to give players even more character customization options, players who preordered the expansion have been enjoying early access to some of the Allied Races already, and that has helped drive early preorders. We\u2019re very pleased with the results so far. Battle for Azeroth also includes two huge continents for players to explore as well as some new game play modes. Warfronts is a new cooperative mode where players will band together in massive battles inspired by Warcraft\u2019s RTS roots. And the Island Expeditions mode will include randomized elements for small groups to enjoy with great replayability which is very important in the game like Global Warcraft. Content always drives engagement. So, just like we did with Legion, we are planning a steady stream of content after launch to maintain engagement.","As for what\u2019s ahead in 2018 with Battle for Azeroth, we\u2019re looking forward to sharing more in the months to come and releasing expansion this summer. There\u2019s a ton of buzz right now in the community and at Blizzard. The team is very excited about this expansion.","Operator","And our last question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin Sebastian","I guess, I just wanted some clarification on where development stands for some of the new mobile titles in the pipeline, not only in King, which I think was already addressed but across Blizzard and Activision following up on some of the announcements on personal, last year perhaps.","Coddy Johnson","So, you are right. I\u2019d probably break them, mobile efforts and new games into two buckets. The first you mentioned which is the ongoing efforts at King on their mobile pipeline. It\u2019s just worth highlighting and they\u2019re taking a very focused approach to development. And as mentioned, expect to have two or more new releases during the year, in addition to the ongoing updates inside their existing live games, which really are just in the live games initiatives in and of themselves that drive new players and bring in new audiences. So, there is as you know and as we speak to a lot, there is real focus there.","But the second opportunity is to take our very successful PC and console franchises and extend them to mobile. And we think this is the time to do it and it\u2019s an exciting opportunity for few reasons. First, mobile gaming is of course not very much at scale, large and growing with billions of people around the world who essentially have a mini console or PC in a pocket. And kind of the second reason that the technology we feel has advanced to a point where we feel the mobile platform now that can fulfill the requirements of our core IP. There is also for us we think a really important opportunity in Asia where we already have some of the most successful non-mobile franchises. And as you know, many of the top mobile games there now are based on existing console or PC IP. That was their roots in console and PC and they moved to mobile. And we think there is an opportunity for us as well over time to explore our IP on mobile in that region. We obviously want to get this right, we want to do it well at super high quality for our players and audiences who matter a great deal to us. So, it takes the investment and time. But we do plan to see some early results there this year from our mobile investments and we expect more meaningful impact in 2019 and beyond. So, we\u2019re working hard in the pipeline and we will let more news to share down the road.","Bobby Kotick","Okay. I think that was the last question. Right? So, well, thank you all for joining the call today. We appreciate it. We appreciate your time. And we look forward to seeing or speaking with you -- and speaking with you over the next few weeks and months. Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 3, 2016.","We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call, however, as discussed on our July 29 conference call, due to updated compliance and disclosure interpretations issued by the SEC staff on May 17, 2016, we are no longer able to present non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of deferrals. On this call and in the future, we will continue to provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of expenses, related stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, expenses, including legal fees, costs, expenses, and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, expenses related to debt financings and refinancings and the associated tax benefits.","These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures. There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary sheet.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Colin. Many of you may notice that the voice reading you this safe harbor is a different voice than usual, and that's because Amrita is out on maternity leave and we're happy to say, she had a beautiful baby a few weeks ago and she's doing well, but we're looking forward to her being back to accompany Colin on the next call.","We delivered another record quarter, and we continue to focus on building enduring franchises for our nearly 500 million monthly players around the world. Continuous innovation within existing franchises and the creation of new franchises like Overwatch helps broaden our audiences, deepen engagement and increase player investment. We believe gaming is the most engaging form of media and players spend tens of billions of hours a year with our franchises.","In fact, this quarter alone, our players spent over 10 billion hours playing our games. This strong engagement and the social experiences that are such an important part of game-playing have been the catalyst for our new opportunities in enhanced game monetization, expansion of our franchises into linear media and consumer products, and greater involvement in advertising supported spectator gaming like we have with MLG.","It's estimated that as many as 225 million people are now watching organized gaming competitions. Competition between videogame players is becoming as thrilling to watch as traditional professional sports. With the launch of professional global leagues, we believe games spectating will grow significantly as an opportunity for us and for our players. The increased popularity of spectator gaming will enable us to celebrate and reward our players and recognize their accomplishments. Professional gamers will eventually be as celebrated, honored and recognized as professional athletes.","Professional gamers will be the role models and goodwill ambassadors of the digital generation and we believe great new business opportunities are emerging throughout the esports ecosystem which we helped pioneer more than a decade ago with games like StarCraft.","In May, Blizzard released Overwatch, which in about four months has already eclipsed 20 million registered players making it Blizzard's fastest, new intellectual property to reach that mark. And Overwatch was specifically designed to be the definitive competitive game.","We're uniquely positioned to realize the full potential of esports. We have some of the most successful iconic franchises in gaming and direct relationships with nearly 0.5 billion monthly active users, a powerful combination that distinguishes us from the rest of our competitors. And we have unmatched commercial capabilities that have served our shareholders extremely well over the last 25 years.","Before I hand off the call, I want to take this opportunity to thank the talented people who drive the success at our company every day. They are our greatest asset, inspiring play, competition and community by creating the most engaging entertainment in the world.","Thomas and Dennis will now share the details of our record quarter.","Thomas Tippl - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Bobby. Thanks to the efforts of our creative and commercial teams, 2016 has continued to be a record-setting year. We over-performed our plan delivering record third quarter revenues, up almost 60%, and EPS more than doubling year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis.","On the back of this strong momentum, we are raising our full-year guidance once again. As we've discussed before, our results are driven by focus and execution against our three strategic pillars. First, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.","Let's start with audience reach which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players this quarter. In Q3, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 50% year-over-year and 25% over the previous record in Q2. This increase was driven in particular by Overwatch and World of Warcraft. Blizzard's MAUs have more than doubled from two years ago, thanks to compelling new content and the broadening of the portfolio to new franchises and new platforms, including mobile.","World of Warcraft: Legion launched on August 30 and has reenergized players worldwide. The expansion sold through 3.3 million copies on launch day, matching the all-time record achieved by previous expansions and making it one of the fastest selling PC games ever. The exciting new Legion content led to an almost 30% quarter-over-quarter increase in MAUs, building on momentum established earlier in the year.","Overwatch's strong momentum carried into the third quarter and its player base continues to grow. In fact, Overwatch became Blizzard's fastest game ever to reach 20 million players. Overwatch also continues to have strong global appeal with a roughly even player split between East and West, and the number one position in Korean IGRs from launch all the way through Q3.","Hearthstone continues to add players and also had record MAUs this quarter, increasing by double-digit percentage year-over-year, thanks to great gameplay, regular content updates, and accessibility across platforms, including mobile.","Activision also had record Q3 MAUs, driven by continued strength of Call of Duty and strong re-engagement in Destiny. Activision has increased MAUs 18% over the last two years on the back of a more focused, yet broadly appealing slate of content.","Call of Duty: Black Ops III continues to be the best-selling current-gen game life-to-date, and its follow-on content has led to continued strength in the player base with record franchise MAUs for the third quarter. Destiny's new expansion, Rise of Iron, released on September 20, addressed a passionate community eager for new content and drove an increase in MAUs quarter-over-quarter. Activision and our talented partners at Bungie are hard at work on a sequel to Destiny which should energize both Destiny's passionate fan base and bring millions of new fans to the franchise next year.","Turning to our second strategic pillar; deepening engagement. Each time we offer our players an opportunity to engage with our franchises, whether in or outside of gameplay, they respond passionately. These opportunities include not only additional in-game content which drove over 10 billion hours of playtime in Q3 alone, but also out-of-game experiences, including esports and fan events like Call of Duty XP and BlizzCon.","An expanding player base and strong engagement across a number of franchises led to all-time Blizzard engagement records virtually across the board, including monthly, weekly and daily active users; unique users and playtime. This is a testament to the epic compelling content the Blizzard team has been creating.","For World of Warcraft Blizzard's priority with the recent Legion expansion was to provide meaningful content and features that supported stronger ongoing engagement. Blizzard has already released Legion's first Patch, Return to Karazhan, making it the fastest post-expansion content Patch in franchise history.","In addition, Blizzard has offered players a new way to interact with World of Warcraft by releasing a companion mobile app. For the first time, players can manage select in-game activities and continue their gameplay even when away from their PC. Millions of players have already used the app and are logging in an average of four to five times every day.","Esports overall continues to draw large and growing audiences, and our Major League Gaming division keeps innovating to celebrate the best players and most exciting game-playing. During the quarter, MLG held tournament events for Call of Duty: Gears of War, Destiny, and World of Warcraft, developing deep industry relationships. Our esports report and premium content recorded about 50 million video views on Facebook, growing 67% quarter-over-quarter and reached a record 11 million users in a single day. In our games, our proprietary video player and GameBattles will soon be integrated with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and will allow fans easy access to Call of Duty World League in professional play, as well as amateur competitions.","We're also looking forward to the MLG Las Vegas event held over three days in December which will feature the first Call of Duty World League event for Infinite Warfare and an Overwatch Invitational. Esports also features prominently at this weekend's BlizzCon, which again, sold out in minutes with millions more expected to join the action through live steaming or virtual tickets. Over 200 top players from around the world will compete in global finals across five Blizzard franchises. The participants started off match play last week and the unprecedented eight days of competition will culminate in what promises to be a weekend of epic sports action.","This year's event which marks the 10th BlizzCon and commemorates Blizzard's 25th anniversary will also feature community events and contests, hand-on play and \u2013 hand-on play with pre-released version of Blizzard games, discussion panels with developers and artist and more. It's going to be a very exciting weekend and we look forward to seeing some of you there.","Also during the quarter, Activision held Call of Duty XP, their largest fan event ever. The event showcased the passion and commitment of Call of Duty fans for the franchise broadly and for Call of Duty World League esports events as well. More than 1,000 teams participated in the Call of Duty World League during the 2016 season which recorded 121 million views.","We also launched our first TV show, Skylanders Academy on Netflix. It is the first initiative for our film and TV division and offers a brand new way for fans to interact with our franchises. We think the combination of the TV series and the opportunity to create your very own Skylanders is part of our recently-launched game, Skylanders: Imaginators is a compelling one for kids around the world.","And finally, we recently announced a new live-action game show based on the Candy Crush franchise to be distributed domestically by CBS and internationally by Lionsgate. This is just one more example of the strength of our IP and engagement with our franchises outside of core gameplay. These additional opportunities to engage also reinforce our franchises with our existing players and introduces them to potentially new players.","Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Our direct digital connection to our players, development of new analytical capabilities and new business models all support our efforts to offer great content to our players to invest in. Digital in-game content increased to another record this quarter. Actual in-game digital player purchases were a record at more than $1 billion this quarter and a record $2.8 billion year-to-date. This was driven by broad-based strength, including record participation in World of Warcraft value-added services.","In Overwatch, customization items continued to perform well, thanks to a consistent flow of new content including time-limited seasonal events. Summer Games, Overwatch's first seasonal event spanned several weeks in August and drove record engagement, as well as record participation in the event's unique in-game customization items. In October, Blizzard unveiled its Halloween Terror event which included Overwatch's first-ever player versus environment mode and players responded with even higher engagement and participation. Also, Hearthstone released a new adventure in the quarter, One Night in Karazhan, which performed even better than the last adventure.","Turning to King, whose top franchises continued to perform well despite slightly lower MAUs this quarter. The Candy Crush franchise continued its momentum of increased gross bookings year-over-year. Farm Heroes, King's second largest franchise, also increased mobile gross bookings year-over-year driven by the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga. Strength in top titles led to growth in mobile overall with mobile gross bookings up year-over-year. Time spent per user and average revenue per paying user also increased year-over-year showing strong engagement from King's core players.","In fact, King continues to have three of the top 20 grossing games in the U.S. for now the 11th quarter in a row. King has also made progress against its advertising initiatives, a large opportunity given the size of King's player community and its strong engagement. We've now been testing advertising in Candy for close to three months and we are progressing well against our internal milestones. We continue to believe this can be a positive contributor to EPS starting in 2017 and scaling up into 2018.","For Activision, in-game revenue was driven by Destiny's expansion, as well as Call of Duty which continues to deliver record performance for the quarter and the year. Year-to-date, the number of purchasers of Call of Duty in-game content grew more than 100%, and along with robust participation in Season Pass and a-la-carte map packs drove an increase in average revenue per user as well. It also is an exciting time for Activision as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is set to release tomorrow. Its bold new setting has opened up numerous meaningful innovations for gameplay, paired with a classic feel that Call of Duty is known for. And with three modes, including Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies, it is a complete package for every type of fan.","Also included in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare's Legacy Edition is the ultimate bonus content, Modern Warfare Remastered. The game has been faithfully updated for current-gen to look better than ever. Based on the excitement around Modern Warfare Remastered and the pre-orders, we expect to sell a higher percentage of our higher value premium SKUs than ever before.","So in summary, our record performance year-to-date has confirmed that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off and will set us up for success in the holiday quarter and beyond.","And now I'll hand it over to Dennis.","Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we've made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. As a reminder, our non-GAAP results no longer exclude the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP \u2013 our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Our segment results, however, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals like they always have been. This aligns with how Bobby, our management team and our board continues to review the business and our overall performance.","With that backdrop, I'd like to first start with our segments, as they are the engine behind our consolidated financial results. Starting with Activision, on the back of strong Call of Duty engagement and the successful launch of Destiny's Rise of Iron in September, Activision delivered record Q3 operating income of $123 million and also achieved record year-to-date operating income of $309 million, up 27% versus last year.","Blizzard delivered Q3 segment revenues of $727 million, which were nearly double last year's Q3 performance. This also helped fuel record third quarter segment operating income of $321 million, which is up 2.5 times versus Q3 of last year. And year-to-date Blizzard segment revenue of $1.8 billion is up 59% versus last year, and operating income of $740 million is up 93% versus last year.","I wanted to pause here for a second and mention that just the Activision and Blizzard segments, so excluding King, also set a Q3 and year-to-date record for combined segment revenue and operating income. Notably, this performance drove year-over-year organic growth for Activision and Blizzard segments of 15% for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Operating income grew even faster year-over-year, increasing 78% for the quarter and 67% year-to-date.","Turning to King, as expected, revenues were down slightly quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, but as Thomas noted, importantly the Candy Crush franchise and mobile overall performed well with bookings growth year-over-year. King's operating income was down this quarter, mainly due to marketing costs related to the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga, as well as investments we are making in our promising Advertising business.","Let's now turn to our consolidated results and raised outlook for the full year of 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined measures. Please refer to our earnings release for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter, we generated record Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.57 billion, $78 million above our August guidance and $578 million or 58% above Q3 last year. The net effective deferred revenue was $62 million for the quarter and also above guidance of $45 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.26. That is $0.20 above guidance, of which $0.10 is related to the timing of our call premium, which I will discuss in more detail later when I cover the balance sheet. We generated record Q3 non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $0.49, $0.10 above guidance and more than double the $0.20 we generated in Q3 of last year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP as redefined, EPS was $0.03 and above guidance of $0.01.","The over-performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by multiple factors, including Overwatch full game sales and in-game content, the strong performance of the World of Warcraft: Legion expansion, as well as the continued strength in Call of Duty in-game content.","Turning to the specific P&L items, please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q3, GAAP product costs were 22%. Operating expenses were 59%. Interest expense was $63 million, including a $10 million GAAP loss upon refinancing of our term loan. And our GAAP tax rate was 14%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 758 million shares, including participating securities.","On a non-GAAP basis as redefined, product costs were 22%, operating expenses were 43%, interest expense was $52 million, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%.","For the year-to-date, on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.59 billion, up 39% year-over-year, and operating margin of 21% and EPS of $0.94. On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we generated operating margin of 36% and record EPS of $1.52, up 45% year-over-year.","Digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver for yet another quarter, producing record Q3 digital revenues of $1.3 billion, growing 114% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter. As Thomas mentioned, nearly $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales alone. And year-to-date, digital player purchases were a record $2.8 billion.","Our strong overall digital performance drove non-GAAP operating margins to a Q3 record of 35%, up from 23% operating margin in Q3 of last year. The continued strength in digital provides not only a source of growth for our business, but also will continue to benefit future operating margins as well as cash flow performance.","In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance has led to record cash flow generation. In addition, our ability to directly engage our customers with continued content updates has helped further shift our business to more recurring and less seasonal revenue streams with Q3 and year-to-date records for EBITDA as well as operating and free cash flow. This quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $456 million and free cash flow of $428 million after capital expenditures.","Year-to-date, we delivered $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and $1.2 billion of free cash flow, both up dramatically year-over-year. Q3 non-GAAP, as redefined, adjusted EBITDA of $574 million was up 131% year-over-year.","Turning to the balance sheet, I'd like to start with a quick summary of the positive refinancing activity we completed this quarter. In August, we restructured our term loans which not only allowed us to realize interest rate savings, but moved us to a completely unsecured capital structure which is more consistent with our investment-grade rating. In addition, our positive credit rating trajectory continued to improve with yet another one notch upgrade from Moody's. This was our second upgrade from Moody's in less than 12 months on the back of our spring upgrade from S&P. All of this served as great tailwind as we headed into our debut investment-grade debt offering which we completed on September 19.","We issued new five and 10-year notes which will replace our existing 2021 notes. Subsequent to closing, we exercised our call right on our 2021 notes which had a 30-day notice period. Because of this, our Q3 balance sheet reflects a temporary increase in both cash and debt as the call notice to redeem our legacy 2021 notes straddled the quarter end. Subsequent to quarter end, on October 19, we redeemed our legacy 2021 notes inclusive of the call premium which reduced both our cash and debt positions by approximately $1.5 billion.","Also, please note that the call premium expense drove a $0.10 timing difference between Q3 and Q4 versus our guidance for GAAP EPS. This will not impact the full year and is merely a shift from Q3 to Q4 for GAAP only based on the settlement date.","We are very pleased with the reception of our new investment-grade notes and the overall progress we have made on our capital structure since we first issued debt as part of the Vivendi buyback transaction three years ago. To put that progress in perspective, our gross debt levels are nearly equivalent to when we first issued debt in 2013, but since then, we have paid down more than $2.1 billion of debt, added King to our portfolio, moved to a fully unsecured investment grade capital structure and decreased our blended cost of debt to under 3%, thanks to our strong performance and improved credit rating. So, a great progress on this front as well.","Regarding liquidity and cash, as adjusted for the subsequent $1.5 billion redemption of our legacy 2021 notes in October, we had approximately $2.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet with over $600 million held domestically.","Now, let's turn to look forward to our outlook for Q4 and full year 2016. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.86 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $522 million, product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 61%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $129 million. GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $765 million and EPS of $0.05.","For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $45 million, a tax rate of 30% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 including GAAP deferrals of $0.34.","Now, let's take a look at our full-year 2016 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million. Product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 57%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $313 million.","Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17% including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard for simplification for share-based compensation. We expect 762 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.11 versus our previous guidance.","As we said on prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year, as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include among other things transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results.","For 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $213 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, up $0.09 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.10, which is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance. Again, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP as we previously defined it, revenues and EPS, you would simply add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and to non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted.","So on the back of our strong business momentum, from an EPS perspective, we're essentially passing through all of our Q3 over-performance for the full year in actuals and increased deferrals, whereas for revenue, we are passing through roughly half of the Q3 beat, largely due to small variations in FX rates versus our last guidance, particularly in Europe. Please see our press release for current FX assumptions.","In summary, as you can see, 2016 is shaping up to be a record year on the back of strong performance across our diverse franchise portfolio. Our underlying business fundamentals remain incredibly strong with our direct digital consumer connection powering deeper engagement and more opportunities for player investment in our franchises than ever before.","In addition, we have great call options on promising long-term opportunities like esports, advertising and consumer products. So it's a great time to be in our business with so much opportunity in front of us. As always, we will continue to attack each opportunity with an emphasis on world-class execution and business excellence across all aspects of our organization.","Now, I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take a first question for Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Activision is obviously evolving. It appears to be positioned to add several incremental categories of revenue over the next few years, each of which you touched on a bit in your prepared remarks. Between esports, King Advertising and consumer products and content, which category would you say you're most excited about? And which could you have the most impact on your results in the next couple of years? Thanks.","Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Mike. Great question. You hit on one of the hardest things in our business right now, which is really the prioritization of all the great opportunities we have in front of us. And first, I'd probably add one thing to your list, which is probably the biggest near-term opportunity, which is additional in-game content. As you've seen in our numbers, we've seen incredible growth in this area over the past several years, but we really think we're still only in the early stages here. And if we can do it right and not only drive additional player investment, it can also drive additional engagement as you deliver content to fans more frequently and consistently, as we saw in Q3. So this is really an enormous opportunity just based on the current engagement that we have across our portfolio.","And we're also excited about many of the new opportunities that you mentioned. We are making good progress in our Advertising business with King. And as Thomas mentioned earlier, we expect it to contribute next year and scale up in 2018. We're off to a very good start with our first TV show, Skylanders Academy, which just launched last weekend on Netflix, extremely high-quality and it's nice progress in that initiative. And as you heard Bobby say at the beginning of the call, we're incredibly excited about esports and the opportunities we have in this space, given our strong and owned IP portfolio. You only have to look as far as BlizzCon this weekend to sort of see that in action, and this longer term is an enormous opportunity for the company.","So across all these areas, we'll continue to manage our investments with the same discipline and prudence that we do in all parts of our business, but undoubtedly more opportunity in front of us than we've ever had before.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one on World of Warcraft: Legion, it sounds like you drove a nice uptick in users and paying subscribers. Any help at all on where you are now in global paying subscribers? Just talk about strategies you might have in place to keep retention high on those payers going forward, and I have one follow-up.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. First, we're very happy with the Legion launch. We worked very hard to make Legion our best expansion, and we're pleased and gratified by the player reaction so far. We no longer report subscribers, but as Thomas mentioned, our MAUs were up 30% quarter-over-quarter, and that built on the momentum we saw earlier in the year. In terms of Legion performance, it has matched or exceeded our prior expansions launch performance across metrics like sales, player base, and participation in value-added services. So we're very excited to see how players are reacting and engaging in the new content, including our new Legion mobile companion app.","We're seeing players spend their time across a whole variety of activities, and with all of the content that's available to them, we're hopeful they'll have a lot to do for a long time. It is a big priority for us to continue to provide new content to Legion players. Last week, we released our first content Patch for Legion less than two months after the launch. This is the fastest that we've added a new major Patch to a World of Warcraft expansion in the game's history, and it's also bigger than the initial content Patch that we released for the last few expansions.","Our players have reacted very positively so far, and we're looking forward to furthering the momentum that Legion has generated into BlizzCon, the holidays and beyond, and following up with more content next year.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And I have one follow-up. 2017 ramp, (34:54) some would call it a tough compare. Destiny is obviously one of the bigger titles as we think about next year. Anything more you can talk about kind of on timing or digital aspects or innovation around the new Destiny, drive more user growth, engagement or monetization? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Brian. Thanks for the question. So, as we mentioned, we're on track and really excited about what we think is going to be an awesome sequel for Destiny in 2017. No announcements today on timing just yet. But what I will say is, that sequel is designed to both excite our highly-engaged current players, but also to broaden the appeal even further, bringing in new fans and bringing back lapsed fans, as well. So that's our primary focus right now.","Beyond that, in the past, I've mentioned that the incredible demand for Destiny content has somewhat outpaced our ability to deliver upon that demand. And going forward, along with our partners at Bungie, we've put together what we believe is a very smart approach that will allow us to deliver that steady stream of great content to keep our players engaged and keep the universe live and growing in the wake of that sequel.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from Chris Hickey with Atlantic Equities.","Chris P. Hickey - Atlantic Equities LLP","Thank you, and congratulations on the quarter. I had a question about King. MAUs were down slightly this quarter, but you said that time spent per user was up and it's obviously good to hear the mobile business continues to grow. What are you seeing in terms of overall engagement there and how should we be thinking about MAUs from here?","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hey, Chris, it's Riccardo. Well, first of all, I think in terms of strategy, I think that we see that our focus on the top franchises is really paying off. And as you noted, while we see that \u2013 we see a slight decline in MAUs quarter-over-quarter, the mobile gross bookings have grown or we managed to grow gross bookings year-on-year. And very importantly, the Candy Crush Saga franchise overall gross bookings also grew year-on-year. This is the result of hard work from the teams in the end of life (37:08) titles, focusing on creating fresh new content, both through live operations as we described in the past, and through launching new features. So this has resulted in, number one, in increased engagement and time spent per player has grown year-on-year, it's now over 30 minutes per day; and secondly, we have increased also the monetization per player. The average revenues per paying player had increased substantially year-on-year.","So looking forward, the plan is to continue the investment in the live games, creating more content both through live ops and features. So we expect to focus not only \u2013 and have an impact not only on retention of players, but also monetization. So both monetization and retention are key targets for those expansions. And secondly, we are also focusing on new games. We have a pipeline of new franchise titles to attract new and lapsed players and we have one game in final stages of polish. It's shaping up well and it's slated for a Q1 release.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. We know it's very early, but how are Call of Duty sales trending this year relative to last? Overall, should we think about Call of Duty user levels, revenue and profitability in 2016 as up, flat or down? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Brian. Well, let's see, how do I answer that? First of all, I think it's obviously too early to make any comments on our annual release, which hasn't released yet with Infinite Warfare. But I think that it is important that we think about Call of Duty as a year-round business, which is designed to have a steady stream of content throughout the year to keep our players engaged, and obviously our annual release is a huge part of that engagement-driving strategy. But when we do our jobs right on this franchise, we manage to keep people engaged year-round. And this year we definitely achieved that with record operating income, which Thomas mentioned, for the franchise year-to-date. And I think probably the best news is that's been accompanied with also a record in monthly active users, so in this case engagement and the business are going hand-in-hand and helping one another.","So on the annual release, as you know, we've modeled Infinite Warfare, which is a new sub-brand, down versus Black Ops III, which is our best established sub-brand, and that only makes sense given our historical patterns. But we think that we have delivered a great game that we think is going to do great over the holiday quarter. And it's got huge innovation for our fans, and as you know, keeping a franchise that's been on top for as long as Call of Duty has fresh every year is no easy task, and Infinity Ward has definitely done that with Infinite Warfare, which has a ton of new experiences and gameplay mechanics for our fans while also feeling \u2013 giving that classic Call of Duty feel that our fans love.","Second, Thomas mentioned we think it's the most complete entertainment package in the industry. It's got a full campaign. The multiplayer builds upon. One of the stickiest and most played multiplayer games in the world. And it's the first time that we've had a full Zombies mode on the disk of the main release in a Treyarch (40:41) title. We know there's a lot of fans who appreciate that. And of course we have Modern Warfare Remastered for those who \u2013 those of our fans who long for the classic Call of Duty gameplay with our best bonus content ever in our Collector's Edition. So overall, we feel really good about both the quality and the breadth and the variety of the content that we're putting in the marketplace. We think we're going to have a strong quarter.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, guys. And maybe just as a follow-up on King, I was hoping you could provide a little more detail on the ad testing, specifically how monetization and engagement is tracking with paying and non-paying users in those tests? And then at what point in the next year should we expect those ads to roll out more broadly and contribute to revenues? Thank you.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Colin.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Let me give you an update on the ad business. So we have been testing various ad units over the past several months, and we have tested these ad units in two Candy Crush games. And our plan is to increase inventory by adding additional cohorts of players through the end of the year with these ad units.","As I said in the past, we believe that advertising is an attractive opportunity to monetize non-paying players, and we see that because of the size of the network, and also because the players are so engaged on our network, that the interest from high-quality brand advertisers is very strong. So we want to take this opportunity, and there's a lot to do to take this opportunity. And the teams are working hard as we speak; on one side, on building the inventory; and on the other side, we are building the team and the infrastructure required to take this opportunity.","So, regarding the second part of your question, we believe that advertising will begin to contribute to bottom line, as Dennis was saying before, in 2017 and that we will be able to scale it in 2018.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our final question from Chris Merwin with Barclays.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks for taking my question. So for Overwatch, can you just talk a bit about what your plans are around new content next year just to keep your users engaged? Is your hope to have some sort of new content out every year whether it'd be an expansion or a full re-release of the game? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with the launch of Overwatch. As Thomas mentioned, it's our fastest IP in Blizzard's history to achieve 20 million players, and we're happy to see our players reacting favorably to the new content and new experiences that we've been adding to Overwatch so far. We think Overwatch will achieve record launch-year revenue for Blizzard game this year. We've already had several new content releases since launch and player participation continues to build momentum.","As Thomas said, engagement and participation in the Halloween event in October exceeded the one for the Summer Games event in August. So, so far we've released a new hero, new map, competitive play mode, and we have more content in development. We're very excited about player reaction to the Overwatch shorts and the plans we have for Overwatch in esports which we will discuss more at BlizzCon tomorrow.","It's too early for me to discuss our plans for 2017, but what I can say is that the two events that we've had so far have shown us we have a great model for follow-on content. We've found that it stimulates our audience and drives record engagement. So you should expect to see more events like Summer Games and Halloween, and additional content, which we'll discuss in more detail later. So as the community continues to grow and our player base continues to react positively to the content we're creating, we're very excited about the prospects for the future.","Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","All right. On that note, Mike, thanks for the BlizzCon tease for this weekend. We look forward to seeing you all \u2013 many of you this weekend at BlizzCon in Anaheim and we look forward to talking to you all next quarter on our conference call in early February. So thanks for your time today.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect."],"320":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today's call over to Kristin Southey. Please go ahead, Kristin.","Kristin Southey","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's fourth quarter 2013 conference call. With me today are Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; and Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment.","And I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q will define filing with the SEC and those indicated on the slide that is showing.","The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation, and while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.

Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted at www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation.","There is also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a 12-quarter financial overview, highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary sheet. This quarter, we have also added a number of EBITDA metrics to our earnings release and slides for our new debt investors and analysts.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and thank you for joining us today. 2013 was a transformational year for Activision Blizzard, and for our industry. On October 11, Activision Blizzard became an independent company once again. The majority of our shares are in the hands of public shareholders, many of whom are long-term committed investors, including our Chairman, Brian Kelly and me.","Our transaction with Vivendi delivered immediate benefits to our public shareholders in the form of significant earnings per share accretion. Even more importantly, this transaction gives the company new focus and flexibility.","Our combination with Blizzard five years ago brought together in one company the two most creative talented groups of employees in our industry and a collection of some of the most valuable intellectual property in all of entertainment. The merger also came with the majority shareholders, whose interests understandably were not always aligned with the interest of Activision Blizzard. The challenges and constraints that came from being a controlled company have all been eliminated, and we believe as an independent company we can generate strong returns for all of our stakeholders as we have for over 20 years.","For the full fiscal 2013, Activision Blizzard delivered better than expected financial results, based on the continued success of our games. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated over $4.3 billion in revenues, 31% operating margin, earnings per share of $0.94 and operating cash flow of over $1.26 billion.","Our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our annual cash dividend to $0.20 per share and an accelerated debt repayment of $375 million based on our strong cash flows.","Over the past five years alone, we have returned almost $10 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This maybe more valued in the enterprise value of most of our major competitors combined.","Our great result this year and every year are due to the remarkable talent and relentless commitment to excellence of our employees around the world. Their efforts aligned with our long-term strategy and operating discipline continue to produce industry-leading creative and commercial results.","We're once again the number one independent console and handheld publisher in Northern America and Europe combined, including toys and accessories. We have the most (successful base) MMORPG of all time, and we continue to lead our industry in our ability to generate free cash flow from operations.","Here are some of the highlights from 2013, which we'll be hearing more about later in the call. Activision Publishing's Call of Duty: Ghosts was the number one game across all platforms and the number one next generation game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in both North America and Europe in the fourth quarter, establishing Ghosts as the third sub-brand for the Call of Duty franchise, in addition to Modern Warfare and Black Ops.","For 2013, including toys and accessories in North America and Europe combined, Skylanders was the number three overall videogame franchise or retail across all platforms. And in the fourth quarter, Skylanders was the number one children's franchise again.","In 2013, Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm was the number one PC title in North America. Diablo III, following its record-breaking success on the PC was the first Blizzard game to come to console in more than a decade, launching on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2013. And Diablo III ended the year with over 15 million units sold through cumulatively across all platforms, which (bodes) well for the upcoming launch of the Diablo III PC expansion pack in March. And World of Warcraft will remain the number one subscription-based MMORPG, ending the year with approximately 7.8 million subscribers.","Much to our positive surprise, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 sold over 7 million units combined in 2013, faster than their predecessors did at their launch.","Not only these devices deliver faster processing and better graphics, but these new consoles and continuing improvements to broadband infrastructure world-wide provide new and improved capabilities for online gaming, including same-day downloads, improved social features and new opportunities for emerging potentially higher margin business models like the sale of virtual items, downloadable content and other value-added online services that will provide a greater flexibility for our audience to access, consume and pay for content.","The new console should be catalyst for growth and margin expansion. And over the next two to three years as their install base grows, we expect to have greater opportunity to capitalize on a rapidly expanding audience, broader international penetration and more profitable business models.","In 2013, we also saw for the first time large creative opportunities coupled with sizeable financial returns on mobile devices and tablets. These categories had much more limited potential in the past. But we believe our capital investments over the last few years will likely result in great new types of games, as well as strong financial returns beginning this year, and growth and international expansion in the future particularly in geographies like China.","In particular, free-to-play games have achieved scale that should now allow us to realize great returns from the investments that we've been making in this area. Over the next few years, we plan to introduce at least three potential groundbreaking franchises operating on our free-to-play transaction systems designed to appeal to players across numerous platforms and in numerous geographies. These games including Hearthstone, Heroes of Warcraft, Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty online, all have enormous potential.","We released Hearthstone and closed beta in 2013, and then opened beta earlier this year on PC only. It is off to an incredible start attracting millions of players in both the West and in China with strong engagement and monetization. Hearthstone is on track to join the World of Warcraft, Diablo and StarCraft as Blizzard Entertainment's fourth mega franchise.","In 2014, we planned to launch Hearthstone on tablets and smartphones. This is the first for Blizzard, and it will enable fans around the world to play Hearthstone on hundreds of millions of additional devices. In many countries, the mobile Internet is the fastest growing interactive entertainment platform and Hearthstone is well positioned for great success.","Heroes of the Storm, which we showed at BlizzCon and are continuing to develop, will bring together for the first time iconic Blizzard characters from across all franchises and an accessible free-to-play online universe. And Call of Duty online, which will be launched first in China with our partner Tencent will bring the leading video game franchise to Chinese audiences in a free-to-play game and in a genre that is now a leading game category in China.","Over the next few years, we expect to realize the broad potential and increased opportunities for monetization from these games, and we will be bringing our focus expertise as developing and investing against these franchise for the long-term to excite audiences for many years to come.","We believe our new games have the potential to be among the largest and most profitable in their respective categories and could generate meaningful profits over the next few years.","In addition to our established brands, we're currently deep in development with the richest plate of new IP in the company's history, which should position us well for long-term growth.","In 2014, we expect the global video game industry will grow, and we plan to release several new games that we hope will set new benchmarks for innovation and should enable us to grow revenues year-over-year and well into the future.","In 2014, Activision Publishing plans to release new games based on Call of Duty and Skylanders, as well as Destiny, our new game from Bungie, which has the potential to be our next billion dollar franchise.","Destiny delivers a groundbreaking new universe, and it capitalizes on advances in connectivity to create an innovative shared world action experience. We expect that Destiny will become the best selling new video game IP in history when it launches across Xbox and PlayStation consoles on September 9.","In 2014, Blizzard Entertainments plans to deliver more new content to its audiences than ever before. I already mentioned Hearthstone, its great start and our plans for the year to expand it to new platforms.","On March 25, Blizzard released Diablo III, Reaper of Souls, the PC expansion for the record-breaking Diablo III.","Blizzard is also working on an exciting new expansion for World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor, which should unveil the great excitement at BlizzCon.","Blizzard continues to work on Heroes of the Storm, which I mentioned earlier. Although like Call of Duty online, no launch date has been announced. We look forward to sharing more about this game with you in the future.","2014 is our first full year with new consoles from Sony and Microsoft, our first full year of renewed independence and our first year of commercializing broad appeal free-to-play games.","In 2014, we also plan to launch the biggest new IP in our company's history, Destiny, and perhaps the best Call of Duty game ever created. We remain well positioned to pursue the many opportunities throughout all of interactive entertainment whether new business models, new platforms, new geographies or new genres.","In 2014 and beyond, we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends to provide great games for our fans and strong returns for our stakeholders.","Now, Dennis will review our results and share our outlook.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our better than expected Q4 and full year 2013 financial results. And then I will review our outlook for growth in 2014.","From nearly every perspective, 2013 was an important year for Activision Blizzard. We have been talking about the risks and volatility associated with the console transition for more than a year now. As expected, these risks materialize in Q4. A strong next-gen demand was enabled to offset the decline in current-gen software. We also saw a significant amount of consumer spending shift from software to hardware with the new console launches.","Despite the volatility and uncertainty of this transition, Activision Blizzard still produce better than expected financial results, achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 31% and generated operating cash flow of more than $1.26 billion.","In addition, this year we return to independence and improved our capital structure in a highly accretive way via our 429 million share repurchase from Vivendi. We also paid out over $215 million in dividends.","Operationally, we were the number one Western publisher and established a leadership position on next-gen consoles. We also continue to invest our capital in the strongest pipeline of new opportunities in our history.","In summary, 2013 was an important year that delivered solid financial results and challenging backdrop, while setting the stage for portfolio expansion, revenue growth and record EPS in 2014.","Turning to our financial results, please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also the numbers that I will be quoting are compared to the prior year, unless otherwise noted.","Our Q4 results were better than expected with revenues in the quarter driven by Activision Publishing's Call of Duty: Ghosts, Skylanders: SWAP Force and Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft.","Turning to the specific P&L items, please note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we generated better than expected revenues of $1.52 billion and an operating margin of 19%. We have interest expense of $51 million and our tax rate was 25%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted share count was 780 million and GAAP EPS was $0.22.","On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we generated better than expected revenues of $2.27 billion and a better than expected operating margin of 38%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 23%, and quarterly non-GAAP EPS was a record $0.79.","Our solid Q4 results capped a better than expected year. For the full year on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $4.58 billion, operating income of $1.37 billion, a tax rate of 23% and EPS of $0.95.","On a non-GAAP basis for the year, we generated better than expected revenues of $4.34 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.36 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 31%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 33% with adjusted EBITDA being defined as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation.","Our tax rate was 23% and our EPS was $0.94. We exceeded the non-GAAP outlook we gave last February for revenues of $4.18 billion by 4%, and operating income of $1.26 billion by 8%.","In terms of cash flow, in 2013 we generated operating cash flow of over $1.26 billion and non-GAAP free cash flow of $1.19 billion. As Bobby mentioned, over the past five years our strong cash flow generation has allowed us to return $9.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.","And today our Board of Directors approved two important capital allocation matters. Based on our better than expected financial performance, the Board authorizes $375 million repayment as part of our term loan, which will be paid in February.","In addition, for the full straight year our Board approved an increase to our cash dividend per share to $0.20 payable in May.","Turning to the balance sheet as of December 31, we had $4.45 billion in cash investments of which $1.1 billion was held domestically. We had gross debt outstanding of $4.7 billion and net debt of less than $300 million, putting our net debt to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA ratio at approximately 0.2 times.","Now, let's turn to our 2014 outlook, which calls for non-GAAP revenue growth, record digital sales and record EPS driven by the strongest product slate in our history and the full year benefit of our new capital structure.","Beginning with Blizzard, this year Blizzard will launch a minimum of three titles; it's most ever in one year, which include a brand new franchise and unique monetization models. Hearthstone, Blizzard's newest franchise moved to opened beta in January and already has millions of players globally, and early engagement and monetization trends look very promising.","On March 25, Blizzard plans to launch PC expansion Diablo III: Reaper of Souls. And later this year, Blizzard is expected to deliver another great major game release. This year we expect Activision Publishing to launch a record three tentpole franchise titles.","In Q1 and Q2, we expect to generate revenues primarily from Skylanders and Call of Duty catalog sales and downloadable content, although we do not expect these will exceed the first half performance in 2013 due to weakness in current-gen sales.","In Q3, we expect the launch of Bungie's Destiny to drive revenues, although we will incur significant marketing, amortization of development costs, which will impact the initial contribution to operating income consistent with launching large new scale IP like this.","And in Q4, we expect to launch new highly innovative games based in Skylanders and Call of Duty, which Eric will talk about in just a moment.","As Bobby mentioned, this year we will continue investing in new games with long-term potential in the fastest growing global segments, including Activision Publishing's Call of Duty online for China and Blizzard's free-to-play Heroes of the Storm. We have not factored contributions from these games into our outlook, because we do not have confirmed launch dates at this point.","Now, before reviewing the numbers, please note that our new lower share count could result in higher EPS variability, especially in the smaller quarters. Additionally, we are launching more than one new unproven IP this year, which always has risk.","For 2014, we expect a slower first half of the year. In addition because the majority of our major launches are in the back half of the year, which will mean greater revenue deferrals into 2015, we expect lower GAAP revenues and earnings in 2014 than in 2013.","For 2014, we expect GAAP revenues of $4 billion, product cost of 24% and operating expenses of 53%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $211 million and a fully diluted weighted average share count of 750 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20% and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.76.","On a non-GAAP basis we expect revenue growth of 6% to $4.6 billion, product cost of 25% and operating expenses of 43%. Higher year-over-year due to the new IP launches I previously mentioned. We expect non-GAAP operating income growth of 8% resulting in an operating margin of 32% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34%.","Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 25% versus 23% in 2013, due to discreet tax benefits realized in 2013 and the lack of a federal R&D tax credit in 2014. For the year, we expect non-GAAP reported EPS to increase 34% to a record $1.26.","In addition, and as we've done in the past our full year outlook for both GAAP and non-GAAP is based on approved upon exchange assumptions protect ourselves against some level of potentially adverse fluctuations in currencies. The difference between our planning, assumptions and current spot rates equates to about $0.07 of EPS.","For the March quarter, we have one major launch Diablo III: Reaper of Souls arriving late in the quarter on March 25. And as I mentioned we also expect current-gen console sales, including DLC to be down year-over-year.","On a GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $885 million, product cost of 33% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $54 million and a GAAP tax rate of 20%, GAAP and non-GAAP share counts of 745 million and GAAP EPS of $0.15.","For the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues at $675 million, product cost of 24% and operating expenses of 55%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 26% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.09.","In terms of seasonality, we expect the year to be more backend loaded as our major new releases are scheduled to be in the back half of the year.","So in summary, Activision Blizzard delivered better than expected financial results during a transformational year, which saw as return to independence, improve our capital structure and establish a strong position on next-gen consoles, while making progress developing significant new games and high margin business models.","In 2014, we expect to generate non-GAAP revenue growth and record non-GAAP EPS. We have never had larger opportunities and have never had a better pipeline to address them. As always our focus, strategy of doing a few things extremely well while keeping a closed eye on cost has served us well and we expect it to continue to serve us well in the future.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric Hirshberg to discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. 2013 was another year of industry-leading performance for Activision Publishing. We were the number one console and handheld publisher in North America and Europe combined. We delivered non-GAAP operating income of nearly $1 billion despite significant headwinds from the ongoing console transition.","Our performance is driven by our two blockbuster franchises, Call of Duty and Skylanders, which including toys and accessories were two of the top three franchises in North America and Europe combined. We also had four of the top 10 games of the year in both North America and Europe.","Additionally, Call of Duty: Ghosts was the number one game in the fourth quarter in both North America and Europe and was the number one game on both next-gen consoles.","In 2013, Call of Duty was the number one franchise in North America for the fifth consecutive year. Call of Duty also delivered franchise record digital revenues and industry-leading engagement levels. Also in 2013, Call of Duty had four of the top 10 most played games on Xbox Live, for Xbox 360. In addition, Black Ops II alone was played for 4 billion hours in 2013.","Skylanders was the number three franchise of the year in North America and Europe combined, and worldwide live to-date has sold through approximately $2 billion of retail including approximately 175 million toys. Skylanders reached these milestones faster than any property from independent publisher in video game history. Also, Skylanders had the number one kids' game for the third year in a row in North America and Europe.","We also continue to make progress on Call of Duty online for China and our next tentpole franchise, Destiny. Destiny won over 50 awards at E3 and Best in Show at Gamescom. Destiny finished 2013 as the most pre-ordered 2014 game and is on track to become the most pre-ordered new IP ever. We also believe we are on track to make this the biggest new IP launch in the industry's history.","In 2014, Activision Publishing for the first time has plans to deliver three tentpole AAA franchises positioning us well for growth. None of this would be passed without the tremendous creativity, effort and dedication of our development teams, our employees around the world, incredible support of our global, retail and platform partners, and most importantly, the passion of our fans worldwide.","I want to thank Infinity Ward, Raven and Neversoft for making a great game that our fans love, Call of Duty: Ghosts, and that carries visions for making Skylanders: SWAP Force the highest rated game in Skylanders' franchise history.","Turning to our industry, in 2013 we estimate that video games drove consumer spending in excess of $60 billion worldwide, which we expect to grow in 2014. We have never had more or larger opportunities. The console cycle had started strong and demand for next-gen games was higher than expected partially offsetting weaker than expected demand for current-gen titles.","In 2014, we expect demand for next-gen games to grow; however, we again expect that to be offset by lower demand for current-gen games. Long-term, we expect the new consoles to drive industry growth and expand our opportunities.","Let's talk about Call of Duty. Today, we are announcing two significant changes to our development process that are both designed to ensure even greater levels of innovation and creative excellence for each Call of Duty title. For the first time, this year's Call of Duty game and future Call of Duty games are being built on a three-year development cycle.","There are several advantages of doing this. The first is, of course quality. This will give our designers more time to envision and to innovate for each title. Simultaneously it will give our content creators more focus on DLC and micro DLC, which as you know have become large and high margin opportunities and significant engagement drivers.","Finally, it will give our teams more time to polish, helping to ensure that we delivered the best possible experience to our fans each and every time.","In order to implement the three-year development cycle, we needed a third studio capable of delivering the level of excellence required for the West's biggest interactive entertainment franchise, which bring us to our next change in approach this year.","The development of this year's Call of Duty game is being led by Sledgehammer Games. Sledgehammer is a AAA studio built from the ground up around proven talent with a 90 plus rate of pedigree, both in studio leadership and throughout the organization. They've demonstrated their skill on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and on their past highly rated games. They are the perfect choice to support our new approach and bring fresh ideas and creativity to this great franchise and to raise the bar for next-gen games overall, which we believe they can do. We look forward to sharing more details on future calls.","During 2014, we also have exciting digital plans including full game downloads, DLC and micro DLC for Call of Duty: Ghosts.","On January 28, we released Onslaught, the first DLC pack for the Xbox, which will be launched on other platforms shortly. We are also once again offering season packs; this provides four Ghosts DLC packs were discounted to adjust the retail price of $50.","In 2013, we introduced micro DLC items for the first time and they have been very successful. This year for those who are outstanding on micro DLC offerings given players a wider range of options to personalize and customize their experience. Let's turn to Skylanders.","In North America and Europe combined, Skylanders was the number three best selling franchise in 2013, including toys and accessories. And we are focused on maintaining our leadership again this year.","For 2014, the latest wave of SWAP Force toys arrived on retail shelves in January, and we have more toy releases plan for this year than year ever have before. For this Skylanders game, Toys for Bob, the originators of both the franchise and the genre are back at the home.","We expect our new game to once again move the category we created forward with yet another creative breakthrough and new play pattern. We will share the details with you soon. However, for competitive reasons we will be reviewing the Skylanders game this year later than we had in previous years.","Now, turning to Destiny, as Bobby said, we believe Destiny could be Activision Publishing's third billion dollar franchise and we are working hard to make it the biggest new IP launch in video game history. Bungie's last franchise is Halo, which sold over 50 million games on Xbox and Xbox 360 with an average 90 rating on their watch. The potential of pairing the creators of Halo with the publishers of blockbuster franchises like Call of Duty and Skylanders should be self-evident. Together, we are bringing gamers an ambitious and innovative game, which combines the intensity of great first-person action with the character investment and social connections within RPG in an immense connected universe.","We believe the game is on track to deliver record pre-orders for our new franchise. A public beta is planned for summer. We expect to launch the game on September 9 on PS4, Xbox One, PS3 and Xbox 360. We look forward to expanding this universe for years to come and you will see much more in the months ahead.","In addition to our 2014 slate, we are also focused on bringing the biggest console franchise in the West to the biggest online gaming audience in the world with Call of Duty online for China.","Our partner Tencent redefined the free-to-play action game model in China and is working closely with best optimized Call of Duty online for Chinese fans. This is a new and important opportunity for us and we look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls.","So to summarize, in 2013 Activision Publishing generated nearly a billion dollars of operating income, and in 2014 we are focusing both on strengthening our leadership positions with our existing blockbuster franchises while adding new exciting pillars to our portfolio, each of which has massive commercial and creative potential. Our early success on the next-gen platforms and our larger slate in 2014 should enable us to deliver even better financial results in the future.","And now, I will turn it over to Mike Morhaime.","Michael Morhaime","Thanks, Eric. Hello, everyone. 2013 ends on a strong note with our most successful BlizzCon yet. More than 4.5 million viewers around the world tuned into the show where we gave you two news games, Heroes of the Storm and the next expansion for World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor.","More than 24,000 attendees got a chance to download those games in addition to Diablo III: Reaper of Souls on PC and PS4 and Hearthstone are free-to-play digital card games. We received very positive player feedback in press coverage on all of our games that has come given us great momentum as we head into the great 2014.","Before we look ahead, let's review World of Warcraft in Q4. Global subscribership in the quarter ended at 7.8 million subscribers worldwide, and slightly above where we ended Q3, meaning that the player base has remained pretty stable for three successive quarters.","We should use the strength in Q4 for a few factors. The excitement from BlizzCon, seasonality from the holidays and a refresh of the recruit of final program which offer special test inbound to players to bring revenue into World of Warcraft.","As we head into Q1, we are not going to benefit as much from the same factors that drove Q4. So we will continue to work ways to drive engagements as we move closer to the release of the next expansion.","Warlords of Draenor will reintroduce players with some classic settings and characters from our Warcraft strategy games. In addition through a new confident, and inventions, Warlords will include Garrisons, which are personal fortresses within the game. Players can collect computer controlled followers to work in that Garrisons, customize their face with structures for special battle sets and invite friends to explore their personal piece (inaudible).","Players will also get the ability to instantly boost one character to level 90 when they purchase the expansion. We recently announced that players will get access to this boost when they pre-purchased a game. So, people would be able to enjoy their new muscular character right away in Mists of Pandaria.","We think that this is a great feature that will make it easier for friends to play together in World of Warcraft. It's also attractive for veteran players, who have already experienced the level and process multiple times and wants to quickly raise a new character to deal ending combats.","We also had some exciting news for Diablo III: Reaper of Souls in Q4. The game will shift for Windows and Mac on March 25, and we began taking pre-orders in December. We also kicked-off beta testing in December and feedback from players has been positive. The expansion will add a new class, the Crusader as well as new areas for players to explore and new features like adventure mode and Nephilim Rise, which enhance for replay ability.","An output modeling system will make playing and collecting gear even more satisfying. We're also removing the auction house from the game on March 18, a change that has been welcomed by players.","I'd also like to talk a bit about Hearthstone, our free-to-play digital collectible card game. Players build decks of cards that consist of familiar spells and creatures from World of Warcraft and battle against other players using the cards. Players can collect new cards, simply by playing the game or purchase cards with real currency.","Entry into a special game mode called Arena can also be purchased with Indian gold or real currency. Millions of players across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America participated in Hearthstone's closed beta test. And a couple of weeks ago, the game transitioned into open beta, which means that anyone can now download the game without any special invitation.","Concurrently across the globe, it has grown steadily since open beta started. And Hearthstone continues to be one of the most popular games watched on Twitch.","The launch of open beta is a great follow-up for the success we had at BlizzCon, while a 100,000 concurrent online viewers watched the finals of our Hearthstone invitational tournament.","We also announced at BlizzCon that we're working on in iPhones and Android versions of the game, which we expect to ship this year. In the near-term, we hope to just quickly transition into launching on iPad.","Hearthstone isn't the only free-to-play game on our site. At BlizzCon, we also announced Heroes of the Storm, a new free-to-play online team brawler. Players can choose from an array of iconic Blizzard characters, customize their abilities and team up with friends to battle other players. Heroes take a more fast pace accessible approach to a genre that has grown extremely popular in online gaming over the past few years.","Players and staff are very excited about the game at BlizzCon. We also showcased Heroes at G-Star in Korea, where it was named most anticipated new game by a (forward) G-Star attendee.","Brand new auto franchise is StarCraft II. The Heart of the Swarm expansion is the number one selling PC game at North American retail last year. And a couple of weeks ago, we made the StarCraft II arcades available to anyone via the free starter version.","We're hoping on a change or encourage new players to try StarCraft II and bring visibility on the thousands of user made games and maps created using our in-game tool.","Since the patch, we are seeing increased player engagement. Going forward, we will continue in (inaudible) with the World Championship series. And we're hard at work on the final chapter to the StarCraft II saga: Legacy of the Void.","To sum up, Q4 was quite busy, an exciting quarter for Blizzard. We showed excitement for all of our games with a very successful BlizzCon and look to make 2014 a great year for Blizzard gamers with multiple game launches.","Thanks. And I'll turn the call back over to Kristin.","Kristin Southey","Thanks, Mike. And we'll start with the questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Edward Williams. Please go ahead sir.","Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets","Just looking at a couple of things, if I could quickly, you guys continue to generate quite a bit of cash. Can you give us a sense to how you prioritize dividends and stock buybacks, debt reduction and M&A activity?","And then secondly, you alluded to it little bit, but can you give us a sense of the console transition, where we should look for demand for legacy software, adoption of new software from new systems and kind of what you're seeing at current retail inventory levels?","Dennis Durkin","Okay. Hey, Ed, it's Dennis. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the first one, and then maybe I'll hand over to Eric to talk about some of the console transition trends.","Obviously our priorities with our new capital structure are around debt repayments and debt servicing. We're very comfortable with the sort of the leverage ratios that you see inside of our capital structure, it's very modest.","We obviously are committed to making sure that we're delivering value to all of our stakeholders. You'll see that by the dividend today. We currently don't have a share repurchase authorized by the Board currently, but like all things whether it's M&A or other activities, we're going to be opportunistic relative to new opportunities, whether it would be inorganic opportunities, but with the same discipline that we've always used in terms of evaluating those and making sure that they're going to be accretive to the things that we do as a company. I think those are larger priorities relative to our cash.","Eric Hirshberg","And as for the second part of your question, I'll take that. The console transition is really no surprise here for us. We've discussed consistently on previous calls that we expected the console transition to create some headwinds and it has. The good news is that the next-gen is off to a great start better than expected. The demand for current-gen software is down perhaps a bit more than expected. And for those reasons, we do have supply in the channel, but we ultimately have great retail plans and proper funding in place to sell this inventory through.","Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question with Brian Pitz from Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Thanks. Question is for Michael or maybe Dennis. Heroes of the Storm is going after a big market opportunity and game looks great so far from what we've seen. Given that Heroes though is a trickier free-to-play model, how should we think about the impact? How many users would really be required to deem it successful?","And then quickly on the level 90 boost for Warlords, what impact could this follow the seat change essentially have on the WOW sublevels longer term? Thank you so much.","Michael Morhaime","Okay. Well, on the Hero side from my perspective, I think it's too early to tell. Our focus right now is just getting the game right.","On the level 90 boost and its impacts of long-term sustainability to the game, I think actually we view this as a positive. I think on the one hand, I think it really helps with winning back players and making it easier for them to catch-up to their friends. And also from a content creation standpoint it allows the developers to really focus on the endgame, which is where most players are anyway and making out most fun.","Dennis Durkin","I would just maybe add two comments on top of Mike's to build on that. On the Heroes side, obviously that's a huge market opportunity and we like to go after very large market opportunities. And we feel like we have a great IP to go after that. It is about building a great game for that market. And so, that's the key to that. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's not in our guidance for the full year.","And then the second one on the level 90 boost, just to add on to Mike's comments, another big factor and this is making it easier for returning players to come to the game, which we think is obviously very important for those players who have lapsed out of the ecosystem. So we think that's obviously positive as well.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Just real quick, as a follow-on, any sense for potential pushback from the community on the level 90 boost for the guy who haven't left the franchise?","Michael Morhaime","Well, we announced the plans for this at BlizzCon. And I'd say the community reaction was very supportive.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company. Please go ahead, sir.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. One question, first off on Destiny, just given how important that new franchise is in terms of the growth this year. How secure should we feel with respect to the release timing? And ultimately who makes that decision, if there are any changes necessary at the publisher level or developer level?","And then secondly, in terms of World of Warcraft, Mike, the user-base, any chance you can provide a split or release some indication around the trend line of users in Western markets versus the lower value markets. I'm assuming given the higher online subscription revenues that this growth came from the West. Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg","So, this is Eric. I will take the first question on Destiny. The best way for me to answer the question about the release date is that we have a very strong history of meeting our dates once they are announced and we have every confidence of the game. The game looks great, and it's on track and we will deliver that -- we're planning on delivering that date.","As far as the second question, as of everything we do on Destiny is a partnership. The partners of Bungie are interestingly completed aligned and we're building this as a ten-year franchise and we need the best game possible. So, we will make any decisions as we have in the past with the partnership.","Michael Morhaime","Okay. And the other part of the question was on the East-West split. So, in Q4 we were slightly down in the East and slightly up in the West.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird","Thanks, guys.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Colin.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen.","Doug Creutz - Cowen","Yes, thanks. Sort of we can talk about Call of Duty a little bit. I think you acknowledged a little earlier in the call that you did add some inventory in the channel. Does that imply that the game maybe underperform where you're expecting going into the launch? And given that and given the competition the shooter genre are coming into 2014, how should we think about your expectations for performance this year? Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg","I think that I addressed at the last question about the channel inventory and the fact that there is really nu surprise there. We expected the console transition to create some headwinds. And they happened in the ways that I described. We think that we are properly funded to sell that inventory through.","Looking forward to 2014, as both Bobby and I said, we think we have a superlative game in the works and that we have some new approaches this year that we think are going to be very positive, with the three-year development cycle with the injection as a lucrative leadership from some very intelligent folks at Sledgehammer games. And that we think the 2014 game is going to be one of it's not the best Call of Duty game ever.","Doug Creutz - Cowen","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. It's been reported in the media that Chinese Ministry of Culture approved the Call of Duty online back on December 4. I'm just curious, what's holding back the official launch of that game and same goes for Hearthstone as well. And then secondly with Hearthstone, how much of your financial contribution do you expect to come from Asia versus the rest of world? And what type of financial or what percentage of people do you expect might be paying for the game?","Eric Hirshberg","So, on Call of Duty online, it's great to have the government's approval early in the process and that will lose a potential obstacle later. But that's very separate from the game development process and making sure that we have a great game which is what's driving our launch schedule. And so, we are approaching, this is a sizable long-term opportunity for the company. And we're taking the time to polish the game and make sure that its right before we launch it.","So, then on Hearthstone question, Mike, do you want to start with that?","Michael Morhaime","Yes. So we do have approval from the government to release Hearthstone, which allowed us to go live with the open beta in China concurrent with the rest of the world. With respect to financial contribution, we don't provide that type of guidance, but what I can say is we're seeing a similar trend globally in terms of a very healthy engagement and monetization.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon everyone. So I want to ask about Skylanders, just give us your thoughts on the competitive landscape in 2013, what you're anticipating for 2014, and any changes that might be brought to the game play?","And then separate from that, Dennis, if you could comment on the timing and recognition of the NOLs you require as part of the Vivendi transaction, any of that contemplate in your guidance for 2014? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg","Sure. And I'll take the first part of Skylanders. As far as the competitive landscape, again there is really nothing new for us here. We always had competition in every category, we operate and that's nothing new. Actually what was new was not having competition for a brief spell on the Skylanders franchise because we invented the category. But as we've said a number of times, it was only a matter of time before competition entered the category-based, given the success of Skylanders.","I think that the important thing to know is that we're able to grow the business in 2013 despite both the console transition and new competition for the first time. We grew and the category grew. We think that also shows the same power of the playback. And we were able to outsell our competition from their launch forward and from my launch forward.","As for in the future if any game play changes, as I said, we're not reviewing that just yet, but we remain focused on the thing that got us here which is breakthrough creativity and breakthrough innovations and Toys for Bob is back at the home this year. And all I can tell you is that we have a great game in the works that we're very excited about.","Dennis Durkin","And then on the second question related to the NOLs, as you may recall from our comments last summer and then again in the fall, the $200 million tax benefit from the NOLs and the related indemnity from Vivendi are large. We're going to have a balance sheet impact and not a P&L impact. So, they will effectively lower our cash tax payments over the course of next four years when they're utilized. And essentially that will offset the purchase price per share that was paid. So, lowering the 13.60 per share amount in equity on a go-forward basis, our tax rate, including the interest tax shield from the depth that we now have for from the transaction is expected to be 25% of -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks.","Andrew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus","Thanks, guys.","Dennis Durkin","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question of the day will come from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital. Please go ahead sir.","Neil Doshi - CRT Capital","All right, thanks guys. Mike, I wanted to know if you could maybe talk about Diablo III: Reapers of Souls and how should we be thinking about the opportunity for that game, especially as it kind of hits the consoles later on?","And then also, maybe just broadly speaking, what do you think could really help reignite growth at World of Warcraft within the first set for World of Warcraft beyond this year, but trying to get back to kind of the levels that you guys had a couple of years ago? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime","We're very excited about the upcoming expansion of Diablo. There is a lot of excitement in the community about new Diablo content. We don't provide forecast in terms of how we think it will perform. But I guess if you want to compare to previous expansion releases, Diablo does have a very large base and it is larger than the Wings of Liberty base at the time launched Heart of the Swarm last year.","In terms of World of Warcraft, we think that the ongoing engagement in the game really is just dependent on ongoing content, and we're continuing to invest in growing the World of Warcraft development team and creating new content. And really looking towards getting into beta on Warlords of Draenor, we think there are a lot of great features that will drive engagement with the game and hopefully bring players back to the game.","Neil Doshi - CRT Capital","Thank you.","Kristin Southey","Great. Okay. On behalf of everyone at Activision Blizzard, we want to thank you for your time and consideration. And we look forward to speaking with you soon.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"659":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Please note today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christopher Hickey, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christopher Hickey","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's second quarter 2019 conference call.

Allen Brack, President of Blizzard; and Humam Sakhnini, President of King will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available for the Company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.","A number of factors could cause the Company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.

In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both the GAAP and non-GAAP results.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Bobby Kotick","Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. Our second quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenue and earnings per share. In the first half of 2019 we prioritized investments in our key franchises and we expect to expand reach, deepen engagement, and drive player investment as a result. We're very encouraged by the early results of this renewed focus.","Our 300 million players spend tens of billions of hours every year watching and playing our games and yet we believe we're just scratching the surface in terms of fulfilling the reach, engagement and player investment potential of our franchises. We see even more clearly than ever before the potential for growth across all our franchises as we create great content for new and existing platforms, leverage our wide array of business models, and capitalize on new engagement models. Each of our business units is focused on delivering more frequent, more compelling, more engaging content and the focus is already delivering better than expected results.","This month, Blizzard is proud to be celebrating the 15th anniversary of World of Warcraft with the release of World of Warcraft Classic. Well over a 100 million players have played World of Warcraft since its launch and the upcoming release is a great example of Blizzard responding to our players' encouragement. We're excited to welcome over 40,000 Blizzard fans at BlizzCon this November and millions more around the world via live stream. The teams at Blizzard are hard at work to ensure that this is truly the best BlizzCon we have every hosted.","At Activision, more platforms, more countries, more players, is the new Call of Duty battle cry. We intend to drive Call of Duty to greater scale than ever before through the release of Modern Warfare and Call of Duty mobile and we believe we will achieve greater reach, engagement, and player investment than ever before. And at King, Candy Crush continues to crush it and it was once again the number one app on the U.S. Mobile App Store.","We remain the industry leader in esports and we will broaden the audience of Call of Duty even further through the launch of Call of Duty Global League. We've now sold 8 teams, all at a premium to the initial Overwatch League team sales and with superb owners. And the 2019 season of the Overwatch League continues to break viewership records. In the second quarter, the season's stage two finals live on ABC was the best performing esports broadcast to date across ESPN and ABC and both stage two and stage three recorded double-digit growth in hours watched year-over-year.","Our organization and our team owners are now preparing to host games in their home markets for the next year and it really is remarkable that in just the league's third year our owners are actually able to host games in their home markets. And we're excited to see regular season games in cities around the world as well, especially across North America, China, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom.","This content is creating great opportunities for broadcasters, sponsors and advertisers. We believe no professional sports league has accomplished anything like we've accomplished in the three-year period in all of sports history. And our in-game advertising initiatives are continuing to grow at incredible rates. Advertising net bookings doubled year-over-year in the second quarter and with the foundation for advertising initiatives now in place, we're actively exploring opportunities to leverage these capabilities across other parts of the business, especially with our esports content.","We remain excited about our growth prospects, we're laser focused on our priorities and our opportunities have never been more compelling. None of our success would be possible without the most talented, focused, committed employees in our industry and the support of our stakeholders. We're grateful for both.","Thank you. And now Coddy will review the highlights of our operations for this quarter with you.","Coddy Johnson","Thank you, Bobby. Activision Blizzard exceeded its second quarter outlook with strong, creative, and commercial execution and with top line performance at Activision and favorable cost timing driving operational upside. In our recent earnings calls I've shared how we\u2019re increasing investment in our key franchises this year across Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Diablo, we're expanding our development teams and resources so that we can accelerate the delivery of content in our pipeline and pursue new business models, broaden our communities, and delight our players.","These expanded teams are working on innovative new content across console, PC, and mobile for both in-game content and for new releases. Most of the work underway will set us up for future growth, but we also saw encouraging early progress in several of our flagship franchises, in particular new in-game content for Call of Duty, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft reinvigorated those communities and drove improved Q2 fans.","At Black Ops 4 we saw market improvement in daily engagement trends since the introduction of a new Alcatraz Blackout Map in April and more frequent events throughout the quarter. And our ongoing work to offer even more compelling in-game experiences delivered strong year-over-year growth for net bookings from in-game items versus World War II.","In Hearthstone a great response to the rise of Rise of Shadows expansion and the substantial new single player content led to net bookings growth versus the prior quarter and versus the Q4 expansions and World of Warcraft saw growth in subscribers in the second half of the quarter driven by both the Rise of Azshara major update late in the quarter and by building excitement on the imminent launch of World of Warcraft Classic.","Now we recognize that these are early signs of progress and that there is more work ahead, but the enthusiasm with which our communities are responding, again highlights the growth potential of our franchises and we intend to build on this progress as we continue increasing investment in our key franchises in the second half.","I'll now provide more detail on our Q2 results against our three key metrics, reach, engagement, and player investment. Starting with reach, which was 327 million monthly active users in Q2, Activision monthly active users were 37 million. Reach was lower year-over-year due to the exclusion of Destiny monthly active users and a decline in Call of Duty catalog, but importantly Black Ops 4 monthly active users grew year-over-year and throughout the quarter versus last year's title.","We think this is the result of the increased frequency and quality and live operations including seasonal events, new game play and immersive new in-game experiences across the Black Ops environment. Engagement was high with hours played in Q2 growing over 50% year-over-year versus the last title and we plan to continue our investment in development of talent, tools, and analytics as we look to build on this momentum in Q3 and beyond.","Elsewhere at Activision, our strategy of re-mastering our rich library of [indiscernible] continued to deliver with the Q2 release of Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled. The game drew positive critical reviews and strong sales particularly through digital channels.","Moving on to Blizzard, which had 32 million monthly active users up slightly from Q1. Hearthstone monthly active users increased sequentially following a new release of the Rise of Shadows expansion and deeper, more engaging single player content in the quarter. While the competitive environment is increasingly challenging, we see substantial opportunities ahead for the Hearthstone franchise. Our expanded Hearthstone team plans to build on the strength of its Q2 content cadence with a strong pipeline of new content and features over the coming months that we think players will love. And we look forward to the team announcing their plans.","Overwatch monthly active users were relatively stable sequentially with engagement increasing following release of the Workshop, which enables the community to flex their creativity and build their own nodes. Hundreds of thousands of new game modes have been created and played in millions of sessions already.","And in World of Warcraft subscriber numbers have increased since midnight following the release date announcement and beta for Classic and the Rise of Azshara content update in late June. The World of Warcraft team is focused on delivering substantial incremental content in not expansion years has resonated with both the current and maps players and community excitement around Classic continues to build ahead of its August 27 release. Blizzard will be supporting the release with a major awareness campaign through a large community of players who have been a part of world of World of Warcraft over the last 15 years.","King monthly active users were 258 million in Q2, 4% lower year-over-year due to decline in reach for their web titles and for King's smaller games more generally. But most importantly, Candy Crush monthly active users grew year-over-year driven by growth in the original Candy Crush Saga and the addition of Candy Crush Friends. King continues to expand live services, features and content across the Candy franchise to drive up reach and engagement. In fact, recently King released the 5000 level for Candy Crush Saga, just another remarkable milestone for the title.","Which brings me to our second key metric, engagement. The King network continued to engage deeply with total time spent and the Candy franchise is growing strongly year-over-year and across our franchises we continue to see strong engagement from our communities. At Activision the Call of Duty franchise saw double-digit year-over-year growth for total hours played in the quarter and at Blizzard the yearly time spent per player increased year-over-year.","As Bobby highlighted, esports have been the growth priority for the company where we celebrate player achievement and community passion and provide high-quality spectator experiences, as well as further strengthen the durability of our franchises and generate new revenue and earnings streams.","Overwatch League hours viewed continued to grow year-over-year in our two stages held during Q2. Season-to-date the viewership and average new audience have grown well into double-digits year-over-year. And as we prepare for the new Call of Duty city based league starting next year, Call of Duty World League continues to enjoy momentum with average minute audience for our two events in Q2 growing around 50% year-over-year.","Our third key metric is player investment. In-game content, features and services delivered approximately $800 million of in-game net bookings this second quarter. King was the biggest contributor with Candy Crush again the top grossing franchise in U.S. app stores as it has been for the last two years and King's advertising business continues to ramp with net bookings growing sequentially and doubling year-over-year. The business remains well on track to exceed $100 million dollars in net bookings this year.","For the rest of the portfolio, the largest driver of the year-on-year decline in in-game net bookings is the inclusion of Destiny in the year ago quarter, as well as the fact that for some of our franchises we're not yet providing the flow and frequency of content that our communities expect. We did however, see clear evidence that our investment in-game content [indiscernible]. Hearthstone net bookings grew sequentially in Q2 following the release of Rise of Shadows and the introduction of the paid single-player content outperforming Q4 expansion and for Call of Duty we saw strong backups for engagement trends matched by players investing in the new content.","Black Ops 4 net bookings for in-game netted year-over-year versus World War II and are ahead of World War II on a comparable like to date basis. Looking forward we plan to build on the strong engagement and on our Call of Duty franchise with new experiences in the coming months. We're continuing to make great progress, laying the groundwork for new content in the esports league, which will launch with teams hosting games in their home cities in 2020.","On the mobile side, Call of Duty mobile is currently in soft launch in Canada and Australia. The early performance indicators and consumer interests are very encouraging, although we continue to plan conservatively on our financials for the launch. On October 25, we have the global console and PC launch for Modern Warfare, an incredible rebirth of the celebrated series developed by the team and [indiscernible]. Built on a engine with a step change in visual, audio and game play fidelity, Modern Warfare is breathtaking. There is just no other word for it. It includes a great campaign set in the current data we think stands apart from anything else in the industry and we're thrilled about existing fans and new players.","Gunfight is a new 2B2 node with dedicated close quarters mal-stepping with lot of fun to the franchise. The fan favorite Special Ops card node returns with more replay build in than ever before. And as we announced last week we think Modern Warfare delivers the industry's ultimate multiplayer playground. The game will not only feature the multiplayer game play that our fans know and love, but also note that the port 20B 25 fight [ph] and an epic large scale experience that will support more than 100 players. The game also delivers the phenomenal built from the ground up PC experience and for the first time in Call of Duty history the game will support cross platform play.","Last week, multiplayer revealed between 36 of the world's most prolific streamers play against one another under one roof, held the number one spot on the industry's top gaming platform and the response from fans has been the strongest we've seen in years and fans will get the first taste of the action in our multiplayer open beta in September. We have a number of surprises in store after that including the largest post-launch content pipeline in franchise history.","Now we know, we're in an important time for the Call of Duty franchise and we feel that we're well prepared to deliver fantastic experiences across esports mobile and in-game [indiscernible].","In summary, in Q2 we made good progress. In several of our franchises we saw our communities respond to the improved cadence and quality of in-game content enabled by our increased investment in development. We see this as a proof point that we're taking the right actions to return to core business of the growth we know is possible and the ongoing momentum in our esports and advertising initiatives highlights the potential to further enhance the reach, engagement and monetization of our portfolio.","I'll now hand the call over to Dennis to discuss our financial performance. Dennis?","Dennis Durkin","Thanks Coddy. Today I will review our better than expected Q2 2019 results, as well as our outlook for Q3 and the full-year. Q2 GAAP and non-got EPS were ahead of our prior outlook. Key factors included business over performance and favorable cost timing, as well as an equity investment gain and a lower tax rate.","To review the quarter, I'll start with our segment results Activision revenue was $268 million, down year-over-year against a comparable that included Destiny. Key quarterly contributors were Call of Duty in-game revenues and the successful launch of Crash Team Racing, Nitro Refueled. Our operating income was $55 million with an operating margin of 21%, which was 4 percentage points lower year-over-year due to lower revenue and mix effects.","Blizzard revenue was $384 million, lower year-over-year due to a decline in in-game revenues. Operating income was $75 million with the revenue decline partially offset by lower costs. Blizzard's operating margin was 20%.","King revenue of $499 million was roughly flat year-over-year and modestly higher in constant currency. Candy Crush net bookings grew year-over-year with the ads business doubling over the same period. Operating income was $171 million and an operating margin of 34% which is consistent sequentially and year-over-year.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter we generated Q2 GAAP revenues of $1.4 billion, $81 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $189 million. Net bookings of $1.21 billion were $57 million above our May outlook.","We incurred a GAAP only restructuring charge of $22 million. We recognized an unrealized gain on an equity investment of $38 million which is included in our GAAP to non-GAAP EPS and we generated Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.43 and Q2 non-GAAP EPS $0.43 and Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 which was $0.18 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.15.","From a cash flow and capital structure perspective, Q2 operating cash flow of $154 million grew strongly year-over-year due to working capital timing. We paid a cash dividend of $0.37 per common share which was up 9% year-over-year for a total of $283 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2019. Our cash investments at the end of June was approximately $4.7 billion and we ended the quarter with a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.","Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for the second half of 2019. Blizzard released Hearthstone's latest expansion Saviors of Uldum this week and is launching World of WarcraftClassic globally on August 27. The team will continue to support Overwatch with new content and events and is preparing for the release of Warcraft III: Reforged later in the year.","King is planning numerous features and innovative live ops across its portfolio and Activision will build on the strong engagement for Black Ops 4 with additional features and seasonal content for the Call of Duty community. At the same time, the team will be ramping marketing as they prepare for the launch and ongoing support of Call of Duty mobile and of course Modern Warfare, our most important release of the year on October 25.","Before I discuss the specifics of outlook I'd like to provide a little context. First of all I would note that a significant portion of the earnings upside in Q2 was driven by timing and lower than forecast costs, and given the abundance of potential we see with our franchises we still intend to invest most of these announced during a year.","But as we turn our focus to the back half of the year, we continue to feel great about how our key H2 releases are shaping up [indiscernible] encouraged by our progress against our key initiatives. At the same time, the environment remains competitive. The ongoing shift to digital means retail dynamics are risk factor, business models are evolving, and FX headwinds have increased since we last provided guidance. As a result we see a wider range of possible outcomes in the second half.","With all that said, we feel great about how the second half is shaping up. We are maintaining our net bookings outlook for the year and are increasing our full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS outlook.","Now on to the numbers. ForQ3 on a GAAP basis we expect net revenues of $1.1 billion including the recognition of GAAP deferrals of $5 million. We expect net bookings of $1.1 billion. When you model Q3, bear in mind that last year benefited from the Battle for Azeroth expansion and Activision's results included the Destiny Forsaken expansion. We expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 29% and operating expenses including software amortization of 66% and a GAAP only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. The expected tax rate of 23%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $772 million and EPS of $0.05.","For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 29% and operating expenses including software amortization of 53%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.20 with no impact from GAAP deferrals. On a GAAP basis for 2019 we expect net revenues of $6.2 billion including GAAP deferrals on $110 million.","We expect net bookings of $6.3 billion, product costs, game operations, and distribution expenses of 24%, operating expenses including software amortization of 54% and a GAAP only restructuring charge of approximately $150 million. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 22%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $774 million and EPS of $1.41.","For 2019 on a non-GAAP basis we expect product cost, game operations and distribution expense of 24%, and operating expenses including software amortization of 45%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS $2.02 which includes GAAP deferrals of $0.13.","So in summary, in Q2 we continued to make progress as we positioned the company to take advantage of the many growth opportunities we see across our franchises. Our combination of leading owned franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best in class developer talent, and geographic platform and business model diversity creates a powerful foundation for longer-term growth.","We still are [indiscernible] and the competitive environment is as dynamic as ever, and we're taking the right steps to deliver the world-class execution and quality content delivery that has characterized our company for many years. I remain confident that executing against our plan will position us to deliver strong results and shareholder value over the long-term.","Now I welcome our business leaders J, Humam, and Rob as they joint for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Matthew Thornton of SunTrust.","Matthew Thornton","Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on World of Warcraft, can you just talk a little bit about just the lit you're seeing from the introduction of the classic mode as well as the recent patch Rise of Azshara and just how sustainable you think that is here into the second half from an engagement standpoint? Thanks.","J. Allen Brack","Hi, this is J, first on World of Warcraft more broadly, the team is always looking for ways to meet the demand for more content between expansions recognizing the kind of sort of the deep love that players have of the game and the value of new experiences. The recent update, Rise of Azshara is a good representation of how we think about large updates for the game.","While Classic is also part of our effort to increase available content, players have shown a lot of support for both Classic and Rise of Azshara. Regarding Classic specifically, for many years we've really heard from players their desire to play the original version of the game and it was a great experience for me personally to announce the start of that effort at BlizzCon.","Overall, this has been a pretty significant undertaking. There has been a lot of technology challenges, but I think the team has really fed a lot off of the excitement that they've seen from the community from the overall player base. We're really proud of the work that has gone into creating the game and we're also really excited for the launch on August 27.","If you are a subscriber, while Classic is automagically included with your subscription, so it's greatly increasing the available content to players and is really a good way to maintain our connection to the game.","We've had over 100 million players experience wow and that's a global number. So it's a great opportunity for many players who were once part of the community to return and re-experience the game as they, as it once was.","Now to your specific question, there is a lot of excitement around Classic and it's really exceeded our expectations already, but it's really difficult to predict sustained engagement post launch. We have seen a lot of strong interest, and we'll see, you'll see us continue to work to drive awareness around the launch in the coming weeks. I thank you for the question. I really appreciate it. Classic is something that's really close to my heart.","Christopher Hickey","Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","Yes. And that will come from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, it's on Matt on for Brian. Thanks for taking the questions. So first one is just looking at the King business, can you go over sort of the key drivers and vectors for growth from here? And then turning to the core, how should we think about MAU and sort of in-game monetization trends heading into the second half? Thanks.","Humam Sakhnini","Hey, it's Humam. Thank you for the question. So after a couple of quarters of MAU sequential growth, overall King MAUs fell a bit to 258 million in Q2 and I mentioned on the last call that we tried to be quite disciplined on user acquisition and we spent less in marketing in Q2 compared to Q1 and so MAU as well have been slow over the quarters.","But with the headline MAU figure you don't necessarily see the important underlying trends. One of the most important ones that look at is [indiscernible] for Candy Crush, our largest franchise which were up year-on-year and with Candy and mobile continuing to represent the larger share of our mix versus web and smaller titles in the portfolio, the overall year-on-year and the new trends have been improving. ","And then specifically on your question on monetization Candy Crush bookings grew year-on-year in Q2, and to me that - those are the growth story for the franchise that has started happening in 2017 and 2018 and I saw it again in Q2. And these long-term trends are really kind of about what we're doing in the franchise and how we continue to invest in content and new features for our players.","So, we know that content drives player engagement and you heard we just released 5,000 level in the original Candy Crush, great milestone for the game. But content is much more than just adding levels. We're adding innovative features and life ops that creates many different ways for our players to enjoy our games, and that means that we offer fresh ways for everybody in the titles - to engage with our titles whether are just starting or where they are at level 5,000.","So, and on top of all of this, we're adding new features, which drive monetization. So as I look forward, we have a pretty strong pipeline of these features planned for the coming quarters and they will continue to deliver these features to our players to drive engagement and also monetization.","Christopher Hickey","Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","Of course and that question will come from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","Hi, thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the future of the Call of Duty franchise. Specifically, it seems that with the focus toward Call of Duty titles that might have the potential to sustain over multiple years. We may be going toward a business model that doesn't necessarily involve annual [code] [ph] releases but instead a few franchises that are perpetual live service games. Would that be consistent with what's your vision for the future of Call of Duty looks like? Thanks.","Robert Kostich","Mike, it's Rob. Thanks for the question and it's a good one at that because we're taking some important steps to grow the franchise overall, and there's probably a few things I mentioned here. Now obviously Call of Duty mobile, it's going to be an ongoing live services title. We're building a huge stream of content and events, keep our players around the globe having fun for the long haul on this one. But if I look overall on the console and PC side, we do still see new launches as a critical part of our future.","These new releases are, have been and continue to be a huge engagement drivers for our community because they bring a robust set of new experiences to our fan. So that said, obviously we want to also build player engagement here over time as well. We're very committed on this front. You're going to start seeing that in a few ways, first with modern warfare.","We're going to have cross platform play as Coddy mentioned and we're also not having a season pass. Now this is important and we're doing this because we want to build one massive community where everyone can come together and have fun each and every day and to support that community as we go forward.","We're investing significant resources post launch content events and new ways to play that we think fans are going to really love. So what I'd say is, we're really looking forward to the launch of modern warfare, it is a great game. And we believe it's the beginning of an incredible journey for our community. Thanks.","Coddy Johnson","Hey, Mike. It's Coddy. If I might just jump on to the question, just to talk more broadly, not just Call of Duty, but also the rest of the franchises in our portfolio, because I think the question is broader really about how we think about live services. And we recognize that the key to player engagement is really great ongoing and [frequent] [ph] content coupled with like core game play features and services that really keep the players engaged.","And you've heard that today, the investment that we're putting against that initiative and the resources we're bringing to bear and earlier results we're seeing are really meant to think about our franchises as live services. That said, we do see across many of our franchises major upfront launches as a very effective and important way to refresh the franchise, to drive innovation, to reach out to new players, to expand the community and so in the resources there are putting into our franchises.","As you see in the additional investment, we think we can get the best of both worlds. We can get live services an ongoing way and then major upfront launches to really drive innovation and to refresh the franchise and expand the community.","So you'll see, you'll continue to see big launches from us, and we're looking forward to telling you more about those in due course.","Christopher Hickey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","Next question will come from Kunaal Malde of Atlantic Equities.","Kunaal Malde","Hi, thank you. Could you expand on your comments about the Overwatch League performance in the quarter and also kind of talk about what effect do you expect the home-and-away format of games to have next year? Thanks.","Dennis Durkin","Hey. You bet. Hi, Kunnal it's Dennis. I'll take this one. It's a great question, obviously because viewership is a great indicator of the health of any league any sports league - like the Overwatch League, and I know from the outside, because we are -- we have some great streaming partners and we're also on TV, it's sometimes hard to get the specific date on that.","You heard in Bobby and Coddy's comments that when we looked at the two OWL stages that were held in Q2 the average minute audience which is the best, probably the best what measure of viewership was up strongly and when you look at the season-to-date average minute audience is up 15%, with the U.S. actually up over 30%, so encouraging trends there.","And then demographically, when we kind of parse through that even more importantly is that we're seeing growth in our younger U.S. audience as well and that's in a year when nearly every other major traditional sport is seeing viewership decline in those audience segments. So I think this really highlights how the expanded roster this year is driving more interest in more places for the league, and that also the work that we've done to enhance the viewing experience is really starting to help deliver some results.","Now that's not to say we're done on that journey. There's still a lot of room for further improvement in the viewing experience and this is a key focus area for us as we think it's critical to continuing to make the broadcast not only compelling but easily digestible for mass market audiences.","On the second part of your question around the home-and-away format, yes we're excited for next year. We think it will be a big driver of not only for local fan interest in many of our markets, but also broader viewership as well. We did see some early indicators of solid progress on that this quarter with the Dallas and Atlanta home stands that brought thousands of spectators to the home arenas in those respective areas and obviously the atmosphere in those arena is actually I think translated well into the broadcast. ","So I think that bodes well for as we roll out format out next year across the league, both not only for the Overwatch league, but for the Call of Duty league as well. So, yes, it's still early innings to use a sports analogy and there's still plenty of work to do, but early signs are very encouraging.","Christopher Hickey","Thanks Kunaal. Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that will come from Ray Stochel of Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond Stochel","Great, thanks for taking my question. One on Blizzard, so how do you balance Blizzard Polish, as you guys call it, an increasing demands from consumers around the speed and pace of content? Thanks.","J. Allen Brack","This is Jay, this is a question that the teams really spend a lot of time considering on how to be successful and it\u2019s a priority for me personally. There is a high demand of Blizzard game content and it's a challenge we faced for a long time. I think we have made some headway over the years. At the same time, I think it's very clear that we could be doing better, and that was one of the driving reasons for us increasing the amount of developer talent at the company as well as really focusing on our priorities this year.","Having more people in place to support the various initiatives that we have and the various features is really critical. It's the -- the process of iteration that we feel is really critical to us reaching the right quality levels.","It's going to take some time to further ramp up on content delivery across our franchises, but we're happy with the early progress. We've seen significant new content for Hearthstone and for World of Warcraft just this quarter, and those are both very positively received by both communities. And ultimately, that's how we're thinking about Blizzard quality.","Internally, we talk about craftsmanship, and to us that's about meeting our expectations as well as the player expectations and both in terms of frequency of content and in the level of polish. And so when we say that we're aiming to release more Blizzard game content for our players, it means that they can start to look forward to not just more Blizzard games, but more Blizzard quality game experiences across the board.","Christopher Hickey","Right. Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that will come from Alex Giaimo of Jefferies.","Alex Giaimo","Great, thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping to get an overall update on the advertising opportunity at King and whether you're still confident in the ability to scale that business over time?","Humam Sakhnini","Hey, Alex. Thanks for the question. It's Humam. So we have a lot of momentum in advertising right now and I still see a substantial opportunity for ongoing growth. I'm going to give you a little bit of color on that. So on the demand side, the -- ad product is in safe premium environment and that's differentiated proposition for the advertisers. And we're seeing both new and returning brands recognize this and as we are seeing this, we are continuing to build our sales capabilities.","So we have a number of strong partnerships as well around that with ad platforms that help fill the engine -- we're making available. And on the supply side, we recently introduced ads into Candy Friends our newest Candy title and we are working on putting ads into Candy Crush Jelly Saga and at rescue saga in the back half of the year.","So we've made good progress on both supply and demand, and we're continuing to increase impressions. As you heard ad net bookings doubled year-on-year again in Q2. And we're well on track to exceed the 100 million mark that I talked about. And as I look ahead, we're planning to continue to grow within the King that work and educate more brands and partners about the strength of this value proposition.","Coddy Johnson","Hey, Alex. It's Coddy, I may jump in as well. Here, just stepping back for a moment, because it's to king's credit that they've built a really tremendous ad platform and set of capabilities that are delivering the results that we talked about today and that Humam just gave some more color on.","We also have the opportunity now to bring this capability elsewhere in the business. We are actively working on this including looking at certain new mobile experiences and also at esports and we think there's a lot of potential to deploy what we've learned across the rest of the company where it makes sense, and so overall there's there is momentum for us, not just in the existing ads business inside King, but we think plenty potential for further growth across the rest of the business.","Christopher Hickey","Thanks, Alex. Operator, we have the next question please?","Operator","And the next question will come from Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company.","Mike Hickey","Hey, Bobby, Coddy, Dennis, Chris, nice quarter, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just curious, perhaps in your Activision re-masters opportunity obviously you have a huge library of IP, there to work with. So I guess just how meaningful is re-Masters business and what the opportunity for further re-Masters in the future? Thank you.","Robert Kotick","Hi Mike, it's Rob, I'll take that one. So at Activision we have seen great results from re-mastering some of these beloved games over the last couple of years. If you look at Crash and Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Crash Team Racing, they are all credible games and our teams have done a really great job in modernizing them for today's platform. Now the player response due to these have been fantastic.","And I'd say, for example, if you look at Crash and Sane Trilogy; that one sold through over 10 million copies. So they are obviously having a big impact on our bottom line and a real impact there, but I'd say what's really important is that it's reaffirming the enduring nature of these franchises for us. And as you mentioned, when you look at our IP library, we think there's a lot of IP in there the fans are going to want to experience again. So now what I'd say stay tuned for some future announcements.","But just beyond pure re-masters are also a lot of opportunities now to innovate and think about totally new content within these IPs. So as we think about it, there is a lot of growth opportunities for the business over time within Activision, based on our library of IP and frankly more broadly across the company, where the company did collectively have the ton of great IP.","Christopher Hickey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that will come from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Olson","Hey, good afternoon. Speaking of great IP, you guys have a great track record of creating new IP but we know how difficult that is to do. And just wondering, can you talk about new IP development and how you're thinking about the opportunity there in general? Thanks.","Coddy Johnson","Sure. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the question. This is Coddy. Happy to talk about new IP initiatives, but first I do want to just pause and emphasize that we feel fortunate to already have a number of large established franchises with global recognition and passionate communities and it's worth pausing there because we do feel strongly and see result around thinking of those as beachheads that we can build on where there is tremendous scope to innovate inside of them.","And we do feel the execute on that potential, the company should be and will be substantially larger than it is today, and we think this is not just true for ourselves, but broadly in gaming and entertainment where large established franchises really do give you a significant competitive advantage and we're leaning into that.","That said, it doesn't mean we're only focused on the existing portfolio franchises. We have new IP projects underway across each of the businesses. And as you mentioned, we've had a -- we think one of the best or when a top track records of putting out new IP and part of the reason for that is that we have a very rigorous screen like process through which we put new ideas.","We're looking at creative, at commercial, at design at every stage of development from prototyping all the way through the build and testing and it's a high bar. And honestly many and maybe most ideas don't make it through. But we think this like that rigorous approach is the right one because of the demands of the fans and of the industry are increasingly significant.","You have to be disciplined about the process, not just because it's the launch of the IP, but it's about sustaining it and growing it over time. That's by far the best experience for the players when you can launch in sustaining grow. It's also by the way, by far the best business model and it's what really drives the returns. And so, that's what we look for, and that high bar means that it takes time for us to bring games to bear and it also means we don't talk about our plans too early. But I want you to be rest assured we have new IP initiatives underway and given our track record, we feel pretty confident about our ability to have success here over the future.","Christopher Hickey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","And that last question will come from Ryan [indiscernible] of Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones, if I may. First regarding the soft launch testing you're doing for Call of Duty on mobile, can you maybe share some of the early feedback you're getting from the players there? And whether there is anything in the data suggesting, hey this game could be top 10 or top 20 grossing on mobile? And then along the lines of mobile, can you talk briefly on what you and your partners over in China are seeing regarding the approval process there for games like Call of Duty and Diablo? Thanks.","Robert Kotick","Hey, Ryan, it's Rob. So yes, Call of Duty mobile now has been in soft launch in Canada and Australia, the last few weeks and the early indicators, so far, very promising and we're seeing very strong and very strong results across all key metrics, including installs and retention. Players are reacting to and I think loving the authentic Call of Duty game play, the characters and the setting and obviously an ability to play across a wide variety of fun modes and when we look at the pre-registrations for the game to us it suggests a real high anticipation and organic demand for the game globally.","So like I said, I do think the early signs are encouraging and now as we think about mobile, there is another interesting thing for us, which is the opportunity here for tens of millions of people to experience Call of Duty for the first time. Now, if we get that right, this could be a step change for us in the franchise's reach. As you know, there are several mobile action games right now that are generating significant reach in revenue. So this game does have potential to be meaningful to us. All that being said, this is a new initiative and we are always particularly careful not to get ahead of ourselves when it comes to forecasting these things, but as I mentioned, we do feel very good about what we're seeing so far.","Now you asked about China and, as you'd expect, we're planning very prudently there and working through the process, but we're not going to wait for China to launch this game elsewhere. We've been keen to get this game into the community's hands as soon as it's ready and they shouldn't have to wait too much longer. Thanks for the question.","Christopher Hickey","All right, thanks everyone for joining us today. We greatly appreciate your interest and support and we look forward to seeing many of you in-game this fall and hopefully in person at BlizzCon towards the end of October. Thanks again.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We would like to thank you again for your participation.

Speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activison Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision; and Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors discussed in the risk factor section of our SEC filings, including our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC, and those indicated on the slide that is showing.","The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation, including information provided to the company by King Digital Entertainment and our preliminary assessment on the impact to our financial information of purchase price accounting, and while we believe them to be true, they may ultimately prove to be incorrect. The company undertakes no obligation to release publically any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, February 11, 2016.","Unless otherwise indicated, our speakers will be referencing non-GAAP measures which include the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games. Expenses related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, expenses including legal fees, costs, expenses, and accruals, related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, the related debt financings and the associated tax benefit.","Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation. There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we'll also be posting a financial overview, highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one page summary sheet.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. This month, Mike Morhaime and I are celebrating our 25th anniversaries with the company, and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Mike and the incredibly talented team at Blizzard for 25 years of creating some of the world's most inspired, enduring and entertaining franchises. They have one of the best track records of any game company in the creation of franchises, and this year with Overwatch, Blizzard will launch its first entirely new franchise in 17 years. From the reaction so far, Overwatch is on track to become a fantastic success. Mike, thank you for 25 extraordinary years, and I'm looking forward to many more together.","We ended our 2015, our 25th year, with $4.6 billion of revenues, $1.5 billion of operating income and $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. Upon the expected close of our acquisition of King later this month, we'll have over a 0.5 billion monthly active users in 196 countries, which as an entertainment network, ranks only behind Facebook, YouTube and WeChat in monthly active users. We'll have seven times the audience members of Netflix and have a larger audience than Snapchat and Twitter combined. We'll be the world's leading standalone interactive entertainment company and we expect 2016 to be a record year for the company, with $6.25 billion of revenues and more than $2 billion of operating income.","In the past 25 years, based on yesterday's stock price, our compound rate of return was over 1,000% and we outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 300%. In our Annual Report last year, we shared our plans to enhance engagements in our franchises and celebrate our players through initiatives like esports. And we're really beginning to better realize these plans.","Last year, our Activision Blizzard games were played for over 14 billion hours and spectators watched over 1.5 billion hours of video content based on our games. In the 2014-2015 season, fans of the NFL watched about 7 billion hours of nationally-televised games, which is less than half the time spent engaged with our franchises. Those televised games generated approximately $7 billion of broadcast rights fees for the NFL and another $4 billion in other revenues including sponsorships, merchandise and ticket sales.","When we think about our franchises, we view our responsibilities to our fans and the associated business opportunity through the lens of these leagues like the NFL, the Premier League, the NBA, Major League Baseball or NHL. Our franchises today generate revenues principally from the sale of interactive content but not meaningful revenues from tournament play, advertising, broadcasting and pay-per-view, licensing or merchandising, all of which are great future financial opportunities we are pursuing.","We think competitive gaming and the spectator opportunities connected to organized gaming competitions could provide sizeable opportunities for shareholders and great rewards and recognition for our hundreds of millions of players. We continue to believe that esports is another long-term growth pillar for the company, and our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming has accelerated our strategic plans. esports helps fuel one of the underlying drivers of our strong financial performance, which is a deepening engagement with our fans.","As I begin my 25th year at the company, I couldn't be more excited about the many, many opportunities we see ahead. Prioritization of opportunity remains a great challenge but our well-defined strategy and focused execution have enabled us to make great content, satisfy large audiences and generate superior shareholder returns for 25 years. Our talented teams around the world are committed to our future success, and for their effort and commitment to excellence, we are very grateful.","Now, Thomas will discuss the key drivers of our overall performance, Dennis will review our financial results and 2016 outlook in detail and Mike and Eric will discuss the results of their respective operating units. Thomas?","Thomas Tippl - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bobby, and good afternoon, everyone. Activision Blizzard had another successful year in 2015. We achieved record digital revenues up 20% year-over-year, and for the first time in 2015, our digital revenues were larger than our retail revenues. At constant currency, we achieved 4% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth above 2014's record levels. These results are driven by our strategic focus and execution on growing our audiences, deepening engagement and providing opportunities for more player investment. Let's briefly go through each of these key business drivers.","First, we broadened our audience reach with successful new content launches and expanded onto new platforms and geographies. In the fourth quarter, our monthly active users grew to our highest level ever at over 80 million users. For the full year, MAUs grew 25% over 2014. And in key markets like China where we launched three new games in 2015, our revenue growth accelerated to 87% year-over-year, faster than ever before.","Second, we drove deeper engagement by providing outstanding game play and frequent content updates. Players spent 3.5 billion hours playing our games in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, engagement was up 16% to a record 14 billion hours, and this doesn't include rapidly growing hours spent spectating which we estimate for Activision Blizzard alone is now 1.5 billion hours. Third, we progressed in something that is very hard to do, but is critical for our business. We shifted to a year-round player investment model, while growing engagement at the same time. And as a result, we grew our revenues from in-game content and services to over $1.6 billion. That's up 57% year-over-year at constant FX.","When executed well, increased player investment and deeper engagement are not a tradeoff but instead can reinforce each other, and we are pleased that our results are proving out this important element of our business strategy. As we look ahead to 2016, in our core business, we expect continued growth from these strategic initiatives against a backdrop of an increasing installed base of devices capable of delivering games around the world. We will continue to see the shift towards a digital distribution network, and most importantly, we will deliver another year of the very best interactive entertainment in the world.","In addition to the organic progress we made in 2015, we also created opportunities for growth ahead through new corporate initiatives focused on the fastest-growing parts of our industry. Let's start with King, which we expect to add to our portfolio later this month. King operates in the large and rapidly growing mobile segment with a world-class management team, exceptional game development talent, and great commercial instincts. In addition to being significantly accretive this year, we expect the transaction will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as a world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, geographies and business models.","Second, our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming will accelerate our opportunities in esports. Major League Gaming provides us with a superb streaming platform, league management expertise with MLG Pro Circuit and online competition and prize play through the GameBattles platform. We believe our investments in esports fit perfectly with our strategy to deepen audience engagement by celebrating our players, delivering high production values to our communities and providing greater opportunities for player investment.","By the end of February, we'll have one of the largest entertainment networks in the world with over 0.5 billion monthly active users in some of the strongest franchises in all of entertainment with meaningful new long-term growth opportunities for future value creation. We couldn't be more excited to welcome the incredibly talented teams at King and MLG into the Activision Blizzard family.","So now, I'll hand it over to Dennis who will take you through our results in detail.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results, and then I will review our outlook for 2016.","Twelve months ago, our original non-GAAP outlook included revenues of $4.4 billion, 30% operating margin, and EPS of $1.15. Today we are announcing that we delivered revenues of $4.62 billion, a 32% operating margin, and EPS of $1.32; once again exceeding our initial guidance, this year by $221 million on revenues and by $0.17 on EPS.","Importantly, digital revenues achieved a quarterly record in Q4, and for the year, grew 20% or 29% at constant FX versus last year to an all-time annual record of $2.63 billion. This represented a 57% share of our total revenues, up from 46% last year. This strong growth in digital revenue was driven by new and emerging high-margin opportunities including in-game content and services, which grew 57% at constant FX. These in-game content and services now account for about a third of our total revenues. In addition, console full-game downloads grew 56% year-over-year or at 65% at constant FX.","From a capital perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow for the sixth year out of the past seven years. Further, we strengthened our balance sheet and we were upgraded to investment-grade by Moody's. We paid a record dividend to shareholders, repaid $250 million of our debt and continued to invest in a strong pipeline of new opportunities with high margin potential and announced agreements to acquire King Digital and Major League Gaming. So, it was a busy year on many fronts for the company.","Now, let's take a moment to review our operational performance for 2015. Activision grew in 2015 on its path to becoming an increasingly digital business with digital revenues up nearly 70% this year, driven by strong growth from full-game digital downloads and in-game content and services. We still have considerable opportunity in digital because even with this strong growth, less than 50% of Activision revenues were digital last year.","In Q4, Call of Duty: Black Ops exceeded our plan in prior year in practically every key commercial and engagement metric delivering upside for the year. And more importantly, the Call of Duty franchise had its largest player community ever at yearend. Destiny's Q3 release, The Taken King, continued to perform strongly as well. We did however experience lower than expected performance on Skylanders and Guitar Hero, which Eric will discuss in more detail in a few moments.","2015 was an important year for Blizzard with expansion across more platforms, business models and regions than ever before. It was the first year since our merger that more than 50% of Blizzard's revenue was derived from content in games other than World of Warcraft. Blizzard has also exhibited strong growth in new territories with China revenues reaching new highs. Blizzard's large online community is growing and is stronger than ever.","Now let's turn to our financial results. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.35 billion, up $135 million versus our November guidance, an operating margin of 18% and GAAP EPS of $0.21, up $0.12 versus our November guidance. For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $2.12 billion, an operating margin of 40% and EPS of $0.83. We outperformed November guidance by $0.01 on EPS. We came in slightly below our revenue expectations largely due to foreign exchange and underperformance on our casual franchises on console.","In terms of EBITDA, in Q4, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $862 million and $1.55 billion for the year. Operating cash flow for the year was $1.19 billion and free cash flow was $1.08 billion. We had no share repurchases during the year. On a non-GAAP basis for the year, revenues were $4.62 billion, down slightly year-over-year and up 4% at constant FX. Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.47 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 32% or 34% at constant FX, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34%. Our tax rate was 22% and our EPS was $1.32. At constant currency, our EPS grew 13% year-over-year above 2014's record EPS levels.","Turning to FX, please note that as discussed on prior calls, the strong dollar continued to be a headwind as our international revenues were translated at lower rates than in 2014. In the quarter, the year-over-year FX impact was $125 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS. For the year, there was a significant FX impact of $364 million on revenue and $0.28 on EPS.","Turning to the balance sheet, as of December 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $1.35 billion was held domestically. Approximately, $3.6 billion of this cash was held in escrow and combined with the incremental $2.3 billion term loan we have committed from our banking syndicate, we'll provide funding for the closing of our pending King transaction.","Now let's turn to our plans for 2016. For the first time, as we shift to a year-round engagement model in our business, we expect more than 50% of our earnings to be realized in the first three quarters of the calendar year. For our Activision business, we expect Call of Duty to continue its strong momentum by the delivery of fantastic new game content including multiple map packs, in-game content and an innovative new Call of Duty game in Q4.","For planning purposes, as we have assumed in past years, we have modeled Q4 new release sales to be down from last year's Black Ops III levels. We do expect overall Call of Duty franchise revenues, however, to be up for the year given strong engagement trends leading into the digital season for Black Ops in the first half of 2016. On Destiny, we expect to deliver a new expansion in 2016 but note that we no longer expect a full game Destiny release during the year. We do however expect a full game Destiny sequel to now come in 2017. For Skylanders in Q4, we expect to release an innovative new game, which for guidance purposes we plan to be down year-over-year given the challenging competitive environment in the toys to life category.","Turning to Blizzard, we have a lot of exciting plans this year that Mike will cover in more detail later in the call. Blizzard plans to release the highly-anticipated Overwatch in the spring, as well as the Legion expansion for World of Warcraft in the summer. In addition, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will have ongoing content updates throughout the year.","Our 2016 guidance today also includes King, as we expect to close the transaction later this month. Note that there are few key closing conditions still outstanding, including Irish High Court approval and EU regulatory approval, both of which are expected shortly. King has already launched Candy Crush Jelly Saga, the first of three new franchise games that are expected in 2016. We are excited about their plan and look forward to closing of the transaction soon. On capital allocation, our board has once again increased our dividend, this year by 13% to $0.26 per share payable in May. Additionally, once we've closed the King transaction, our primary focus for the near-term will be on debt reduction and we plan to repay up to $1.5 billion of debt in 2016.","With that context, now let's review the numbers. For 2016, we expect GAAP revenues of $6.1 billion, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 65%. We expect GAAP net interest expense of $245 million. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect a fully-diluted weighted average share count of 767 million and a tax rate of 25%. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be down versus prior year as the expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP results.","I want to highlight that there could be significant movement in our GAAP outlook as it will be impacted by estimates and assumptions, which may be materially different when the King transaction actually closes. These estimates and assumptions are inherently difficult to predict. Please refer to our GAAP to non-GAAP outlook reconciliation tables in our earnings release for more details.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.25 billion, product cost of 23% and operating expense of 44%. We expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 32% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $235 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.75, which as we indicated when we announced the transaction in November, contemplates 30% accretion from King.","A few things to call out to help you understand the non-GAAP EPS numbers here. First of all, please note that as was mentioned earlier, we do not expect a full-game Destiny release this year, which has an approximately $0.15 impact on our guidance. A full-game Destiny sequel is now expected in 2017. Also note that we plan to transition King's current compensation plan from an equity-based compensation program to a cash-based profit-sharing plan more similar to what is used today at Blizzard and in Activision studio organization. Overall this is value-neutral as it moves equity expense into compensation expense. However, it will negatively affect non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.06 this year. We believe that this incentive structure has proven successful in our existing business and we're confident that it will also drive business results with King. Note that both the Destiny timing and the King compensation impact are included in our $1.75 non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.","Now let's turn to our quarterly outlook, which assumes King closes later this month. On a GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.26 billion, product costs of 21% and operating expenses of 58%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $55 million, a tax rate of 25% and share count of 756 million shares. We expect GAAP EPS of $0.21. On a non-GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect revenues of $800 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 57%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.11.","In summary, 2015 was an important year for Activision Blizzard and we again delivered strong financial results during a truly transformational year for the company, which set a strong foundation for future growth. With the largest interactive entertainment network, some of the most important wholly-owned franchises in all of entertainment, solid execution skill and continued business discipline, we are poised for continued success in driving shareholder value creation over the long-term.","Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. 2015 was an important growth year for Activision. Our digital revenues grew by 68% year-over-year. At constant currency our total revenues grew 7% and our operating income grew 30% year-over-year with more than 600 basis points of margin expansion.","We're providing great year-round content that our fans love and as a result our monthly active users were up 20% in 2015 year-over-year with a double-digit increase in Q4 as well, reaching our highest level ever. We grew our leadership on next-gen and we now have four of the top 10 titles on PS4 and Xbox One live to date, including the number-one spot with Call of Duty: Black Ops III. And our partnership with Sony is off to a great start on both Call of Duty and Destiny.","This year we saw our largest franchise, Call of Duty, ascend to new heights with performance above our plan. OI and margin growth for Call of Duty continues to expand, and we also saw phenomenal reception to in-game content and services. This is a virtuous cycle. Engagement creates the opportunity for us to earn additional player investment by providing more great content, which in turn leads to more engagement.","Along with our partners at Bungie, we continued to grow Destiny's incredibly loyal audience base and introduce new ways to excite the community throughout the year, culminating in the release of The Taken King, which achieved record digital attach rates in Q3. And the Destiny community responded well to the new content we made available for purchase in-game in Q4, which allowed players to customize their experience.","Our games for core audiences did extremely well, but our games for casual audiences performed below expectations, largely due to greater competition in the toys-to-life genre and we believe because of the casual audience's shift to mobile devices, which will benefit the company overall in the future. We want to be where our casual audience is. In light of the pending King transaction, we're exploring new opportunities on mobile.","While Skylanders performed below our expectations, we believe in its future and remain committed to the franchise. We will do what we always do, which is to make sure that we have right-sized the investment on our efforts in the category while continuing to introduce breakthrough innovations that our fans will love. We're excited about the innovations in the next Skylanders game launching this fall from the creators of the franchise and the genre, Toys for Bob. More on that in the coming months.","We expect to launch Skylanders Academy, a new animated TV series later this year, which will help extend the reach and the popularity of the franchise and introduce our characters and their adventures to new audiences. Next, Guitar Hero Live is a fun, high-quality game that introduced innovative new game play to fans, including the GHTV platform, which keeps our community engaged and will allow us to cost-effectively deliver new content and build our installed base. We plan to release new content, but not another full Guitar Hero console game this cycle.","Turning to Destiny, the Destiny community is one of the most passionate, loyal audiences for a game that we have ever seen. Our audience has logged nearly three billion hours in the game. We're excited to announce that we will be bringing a large new expansion to Destiny this year that players are going to love. We will also be delivering other content and events throughout the year to keep the community engaged. We are also working with Bungie on the sequel to Destiny, which will be coming in 2017, and we look forward to sharing more with you on this in the future.","Finally, Call of Duty, which continues to gain momentum and set new records. In quarters one through three, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare over-performed our plan and the prior year with very strong performance on our digital season of content. In Q4, Call of Duty: Black Ops III exceeded our plan and the prior year in practically every key area: retail sell-in and sell-through, digital full game sales, digital in-game sales and season pass sales.","Black Ops III delivered the biggest entertainment launch of 2015, even beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens in its opening weekend. Black Ops III was the top-selling console game globally by a wide margin in both units and dollars sold through. In fact, according to NPD and GfK, we sold through more copies of Black Ops III than the two closest competitors in the genre combined.","On a franchise basis, Call of Duty was number one in North America for an incredible seventh year in a row and has now surpassed 250 million units sold life-to-date worldwide with over $15 billion in sell-in on full game and in-game content. Importantly, engagement on Call of Duty exceeded both our plan and the prior year. Call of Duty franchise monthly active users grew by 20% year-over-year in December and time spent grew by 30%. In fact, in November and December, we had the highest monthly active users in franchise history.","This reach and engagement is a promising sign as we look ahead to Black Ops III's upcoming 2016 season of content. Season pass sales for Black Ops III have increased significantly year-over-year, setting a franchise record for total sales.","We're seeing that players are deeply invested in personalizing their game play experience in the game. We launched Supply Drops for Advanced Warfare well after the launch of the game itself, driving significant player investment and strong engagement. We have already launched an early version of Supply Drops in Black Ops III and we plan to create more fun, new content for our fans to enjoy in the months ahead.","This Q4 we will have a new innovative Call of Duty game from our award-winning studio, Infinity Ward, the makers of the Modern Warfare series. And, of course, our esports initiatives on Call of Duty are transforming the experience for pro players and fans alike. Interesting Call of Duty esports continues to rise with a third more people watching the prequalifying matches for Call of Duty World League than watched the championship matches last year. The top teams in the world are competing each week in live broadcast competition to see who will qualify for the Call of Duty World Championships later this year. We'll broadcast 750 hours of competitive Call of Duty programming, but more importantly we'll inspire millions of Call of Duty fans to celebrate the game in a whole new way.","And now I'll turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Eric. 2015 was another strong year for Blizzard. We achieved an all-time high in active players and ended Q4 up nearly 25% in average MAUs year-over-year. On a constant currency basis we achieved even higher revenues in 2015 than 2014, which was a record year for us. These results reflect our careful and long held approach to growing our community and deepening their engagement with high-quality content.","In 2015 we expanded to new platforms and new regions, bringing our games to more players than ever before. In addition, we broke new ground with the first live telecast of a collegiate esports tournament on ESPN. And our ninth BlizzCon highlighted the amount of diversity and diversity of upcoming content in our pipeline. BlizzCon also showed the strong connection we have with our global community. More than 25,000 Blizzard gamers attended the show from all 50 states and nearly 60 countries. We had our highest live stream viewership ever with over 10 million people around the world tuning in, and we had record audience on pay-per-view as well. Our specific franchise highlights further demonstrate the value we see in delivering and supporting high-quality game experiences globally.","Hearthstone had a great quarter and a great year. For those who might not be familiar with Hearthstone, it's our free-to-play collectable card game on PC, Mac, tablet and mobile. It has very strong global appeal and it brought Blizzard to a new genre on new platforms with a new business model. Ahead of BlizzCon, Hearthstone surpassed 40 million registered players and it closed out December with record global engagement in multiple categories including MAUs. The introduction of Hearthstone on mobile last year was a big contributor to that.","We announced our new adventure, The League of Explorers at BlizzCon and launched it the following week. League of Explorers brings new cards, new game mechanics and a lot of personality. Despite the shorter window to launch and no presales as we'd had with our previous adventure, League of Explorers sold over 20% more units as of six weeks post launch. We also expanded Hearthstone into a new region. In October we released the Japanese version providing easier access for new and existing Japanese players.","Moving onto World of Warcraft, we saw quarter-over-quarter growth in Q4 as we kicked off presales at BlizzCon for our new expansion, Legion, which is coming out in the summer, and we released a new content patch. With Legion we're taking care to build off the best aspects of Warlords of Draenor to create an experience that appeals to an even wider audience and which offers more opportunities for sustained engagement.","Legion adds a new hero class, customizable weapons, class order hauls, which strengthen the social elements of the game and more. This will give players more compelling options for extending their experience. With this expansion we are again offering a character level boost immediately with pre-purchase. And for the first time, we're also offering early access to the new character class, which will be activated for everyone who pre-purchases the expansion once it's ready.","Before I move on, I want to thank our community for the generosity they showed with the World of Warcraft charity pet that we offered on behalf of Make-A-Wish. With our player support we achieved a new record for the donation we'll be making to Make-A-Wish, over $1.7 million. That reflects the passion and power of a very strong and very engaged community.","Next, Overwatch, our new IP, which will be a big step into a new genre for us as well as our first simultaneous release across multiple platforms. As with other Blizzard franchises, we have long-term plans to support this new IP with more content and also with external world-building efforts and a robust esports program. Overwatch made a lot of news in the quarter and continued to build momentum. We announced the remainder of the 21 hero launch lineup at BlizzCon and revealed the console versions of the game. We also began closed beta testing reaching top-viewed status on Twitch. In addition, we shared our plans to patch in more heroes after launch, which received a very positive response. We are excited about Overwatch's potential and we look forward to sharing more details as we get closer to its spring release.","One of our big highlights for the quarter was the launch of StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void. The new features and content make StarCraft II easier to get into than ever before, and we saw a lot of excitement with the launch. As of its first 24 hours, Legacy of the Void had sold through more than 1 million copies. In addition it received multiple awards for best strategy game of 2015.","At BlizzCon we announced a series of standalone digital mission packs featuring Nova, a popular character in StarCraft II and Heroes of the Storm. This content will give players exciting new options for continuing their StarCraft II experience, and it will be a great entry point for anyone new to StarCraft. We've been very pleased to see a very positive player response and look forward to releasing the first mission pack in the spring.","Q4 was also a busy one for Heroes of the Storm, our free-to-play team brawler that features iconic characters from across our bestselling franchises. With Heroes of the Storm, we've worked hard to push the boundaries of the genre, while keeping the game engaging and accessible for the widest possible audience. For example, at BlizzCon we announced a new game mode, The Arena, which will mix up gameplay with fun parameters, smaller maps and shorter sessions when it's released later this year. We also revealed our tenth Battleground and three new heroes at the show, including Cho'gall, a hero controlled by two players. Players around the world have responded with enthusiasm for unique heroes like Cho'gall, and with support for the experience that Heroes of the Storm delivers. Heroes of the Storm had a great close to the year, taking home multiple awards, including Best Competitive Multiplayer and Best MOBA from Game Informer.","I also want to touch on the Diablo III, which has a strong and active community nearly four years after launch. The game performed very well throughout 2015, in part due to our launch in China, which broke sales records there. Players and the media have been enthusiastic about the content we've added over time and our recent patch in January is no exception. There are new zones, legendary weapons, set dungeons and more. In addition we periodically restart seasons, refreshing the challenge for players. Diablo III continues to thrive in all regions and we appreciate all the support from players around the world.","We are also supporting community engagement and franchise growth outside of our games, particularly with world-class esports that represent the diversity of our portfolio and our audiences' interests. At BlizzCon we had our strongest esports lineup to date and crowned champions in Hearthstone, World of Warcraft Arena, StarCraft II and Heroes of the Storm, four very different but equally exciting esports experiences for attendees and spectators online.","Looking forward, 2016 will be our biggest Blizzard esports program ever. It will be Heroes of the Storm's first full year of global competition. In addition, Heroes of the Dorm collegiate tournament is return and we've added another evening of primetime coverage this time. With the final matches \u2013 The Heroic Four \u2013 playing out over two nights on ESPN 2. We also made changes to the StarCraft II World Championship Series and Hearthstone's Championship Tour to give local heroes even more opportunities to shine. And we're excited about our esports plans for Overwatch and look forward to sharing more details about that in the future.","With strength across all franchises and broader reach than ever, we're very enthusiastic about 2016. We are especially excited about the spring launch of Overwatch and look forward to releasing World of Warcraft Legion in the summer on the heels of the June release of the Warcraft movie. With all the content and activities we have planned, we expect another year of solid growth of the Blizzard community and we're very excited about the future.","As Bobby mentioned, Monday was Blizzard's 25th anniversary. We've poured our hearts into making great games for 25 years. We're very proud of the worlds that we've created and the great moments we've shared with our players. We are extremely grateful for the support of our players, and we look forward to many more adventures in the next 25 years and beyond.","Thank you, and I'll turn the call back over to Amrita.","Amrita Ahuja - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we're ready for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll first go to Doug Creutz from Cowen and Company.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company","Hey. Thanks. Just on King just briefly, you can confirm that I can do math. With a $1.75 guide and 30% accretion, it sounds like you're expecting $1.35 from the existing business and $0.40 from King. And then the longer question is with King, most of King's peers advertise in their games and King does not. And I know King had some reasons why they made that decision, but I'm just wondering if you look at that, do you think that's a significant opportunity for King going forward? Thank you.","Thomas Tippl - Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Doug. So the way we think about advertising, we think of it as a proven part of large network entertainment businesses like Facebook, YouTube and even Twitch. And therefore we believe it could also be a huge opportunity for the network that we're building, particularly the parts that are accessible for free. Now all that said, we have and always will prioritize a great user experience above all else, and therefore this is an opportunity that we will approach with great care and is also the reason why none of it is factored into the plan and the numbers that we just shared with you today. But when you think about the future, we think there's a significant opportunity and with that significant option value there.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company","Great. And then just the question about guidance?","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Doug, it's Dennis. On that, due to the ongoing King transaction and the Irish regulatory restrictions until we get that approval, we're actually not able to unpack the specifics of the pieces. So we'll have to cover that as we get into our next quarterly call.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company","Okay, fair enough.","Operator","And we'll now move to Brian Pitz from Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. A question on Destiny. Lots of change obviously going on at Bungie right now. Maybe you could comment on what it all means? And then any commentary maybe on micro transaction plans for the driving of ongoing engagement? Thanks so much.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Brian. So, first of all, it's important for us to keep it in context and acknowledge that we have incredible success on our hands with Destiny that we've created with Bungie, the partnership between Activision and Bungie has proven to be a potent one and we don't see that changing. I think Bungie's proven themselves to be a capable team over many years and many games and combinations of leadership. So while the decisions that they made recently related to their organization are up to them, we're confident that our interests remain 100% aligned and that we're going to continue together to deliver amazing content for our shared fans.","On the second part of your question, Destiny is one of the most engaging games of all time and our first job is to make sure that it stays that way. So all the content that we're providing is designed to make sure that we not only capitalize on that engagement, but also continue to make the game better and better for our fans, and that's why we're planning on delivering a large expansion this year and more incremental content along the way to keep fans engaged. And of course we're looking forward to Destiny 2 in 2017.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll now go to Neil Doshi from Mizuho.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Mike, can you maybe help us think about the units built into the guide for Overwatch? I know you guys don't really guide to units, but maybe help us think about other games in the past as a potential comp and how we should be thinking about Overwatch's contribution? And then what drove the solid growth in China revenue, and how much of that came from Call of Duty in China? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","So you're right, we don't typically provide sales guidance. But what I can say is we're extremely excited about Overwatch. It's an important step for us into a new genre that we think has a ton of potential. We have seen a very positive response from players, over 8 million players have signed up for the beta test. Since beta we have been very happy with viewership interest on Twitch.","Overwatch is every bit a Blizzard game in terms of I think it exemplifies the design values that we have. It's a ton of fun, it's excellent gameplay, art style, interface. And so I think we're bringing a Blizzard take to an already very fun genre. We're looking forward to launching on PC and consoles on a simultaneous launch this spring. And like other Blizzard franchises, we have long-term plans to support Overwatch through ongoing content, world-building efforts outside of the game to build the franchise, the IP and a robust esports program. So we have a lot of reasons to be very optimistic that Overwatch will be an important long-term addition to our collection of franchises.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Right. And then to the second \u2013 I guess maybe the first part of your question about China and sort of how China revenues have moved. A lot of the growth came over the course of the year by having \u2013 we obviously have more games in in-market than we've had in the past. But it was really broad-based performance across the portfolio. Diablo obviously had a very strong year, Hearthstone as well caught online, and the rest of the portfolio. So it was really the breadth of the portfolio, but it was really broad-based performance across the portfolio.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","And we'll now go to Arvind Bhatia from Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Good. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if just going back to the Call of Duty online China question, just how that's been trending throughout the year and as you exit 2015, now that you've had a little bit of time to see it ramp up, how is it performing relative to what you might have expected? And does your 2016 guidance contemplate meaningful contribution from that? Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Thanks, Arvind. The game has been growing revenues month-over-month for the last six months in a row and we believe that the updates we have planned for 2016 will further improve the game play and the performance. The updates to come this year are going include enhancements to the user interface, to onboarding, the addition of supply drops inspired by the success we've seen with that in our western products, esports features and social systems that will make our communities' engagement even stronger and additional modes and maps and characters as well. We also continue to work closely with Tencent to bring more people into the game, which is critical. So we remain optimistic about the game's opportunities and as we said when we launched the game into beta, it will take time to build the ramp.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Relative to the second part of your question what's in the guidance, we have a very prudent I'd say ramp forward even though we have great aspirations for the opportunity that we have inside the game.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Hoping you could add a little detail on the investment required to support both esports as well as the broader multimedia initiatives? And more specifically, how much upfront and ongoing investment or risk do you take on versus the media partners?","And then secondly, obviously you mentioned competition intensifying with some of the casual games, but just to confirm is there any macro related pressure either we're seeing through price discounting or sell through that you can identify? Thank you.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'll take the first one, Colin. So as we said there isn't a significant investment in the esports individual operating unit initiative or in the other broader media areas. But what we step back and look at is ESPN. And when you look at ESPN with 80 million subscribers and you see the flight of some of the subscribers, and the opportunities that we see there is roughly $5 billion of operating profit there, $4 billion of league payments for the broadcast rights, and we have 80 million of our own players.","And over a long period of time we think that watching a video game competition is going to be a tremendous opportunity. It doesn't require a very big investment today, it just requires us to have and in fact most of the efforts we have are funded by things like organized competition ticket fees, but when you look at what the opportunity is for the future to enhance engagement, to build and strengthen our franchises, to celebrate our players, to provide rewards and recognition for our players; these initiatives are really important for the building of engagement and enhancing the value of our franchises.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I guess just to build on that from the investment side, all of our investments start with great people, we now have great leaders in those businesses to prudently invest behind, but as we always are, we're being very choiceful in how we invest and disciplined about the gated investments in those areas. This year it's really less than a couple pennies of investment that will go into our new divisions from an overall company EPS perspective. And most of that is against the media networks which is our esports division that Bobby was referencing there.","We do have additional esports investments in some of our business and franchise level details like Mike and Eric alluded to, but we think those are more around demand generation than anything and help support the franchises that they cover.","On your other question, Colin, around macro environment and sort of competitive aspects, it is, yeah, you hit on the obviously Skylanders and Guitar Hero points where in the casual segment on console there was more competition, that feels more category specific. When we look more across the broad base of our business, we feel we haven't really felt many of the macro trends that are sort of \u2013 and volatility we've seen in the overall market really affecting our business. And in fact, many of the digital trends when you look at our biggest franchises are stronger than ever. And in fact, in many new regions, even regions that are experiencing some turmoil like China, we've had great growth in the past year. So for us, it's more about delivering great content on cadence that will be the most important thing for us.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks, guys.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Colin.","Operator","And we'll now go to Eric Handler from MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Interested \u2013 what do you think is going to be the planned cadence of releases for Hearthstone this year? And maybe how should we think about the key drivers of growth there in terms of users, specifically like what markets are showing the best growth, and is there still growth drivers among the digital platforms? And also, when you think about higher spending per user, what's going to be the key driver of that?","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Okay. Regarding cadence, we definitely have plans for some great new content this year, but we're not quite ready to discuss the timing. I can confirm that our next expansion will be out in the spring.","As for growth drivers, we've consistently seen strong engagement pretty much universally globally, and we plan to continue supporting that with new content for the foreseeable future. Bringing Hearthstone to mobile last year drove a lot of growth, as did releasing a good amount of new content. We also plan to support the community around social events for the game such as fireside gatherings and high-profile esports experiences. This also drives engagement. In addition, we'll be looking at geographical expansion opportunities like we did last year with Japan. In general, spending does increase around new content, so we're focusing on providing great experiences with new content and making careful design decisions to make sure we protect the long-term health of the game.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And our last question will come from Chris Merwin from Barclays.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I just had one. For all of your titles, what percentage of unit sales were digital downloads in the fourth quarter? And as it relates to your 2016 guidance, what are you implicitly factoring in for digital downloads, and what would that imply for gross margins? Thanks.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Chris. Thanks. Obviously, the digital transition has been a very nice tailwind for us over the past several years. And really, front-line console games are the final part of that transition, but it's only really part of the equation. As we mentioned in the call in Thomas's remarks and my remarks, the add on content in services which is purchases effectively after the initial sale are really increasingly more important or as important and are growing incredibly fast and is one of the fastest parts of our digital portfolio.","To your question, though, on front-line titles, it really varies by title. So for games like Destiny, it had, in the high-20%s in terms of digital downloads. In terms of overall volume for Call of Duty just based on the size of the player base, full game downloads were a lower share than that, although on an absolute basis, full game downloads were up over 80% year-over-year, so very nice progress there. And we know when we look at the Blizzard side of our portfolio on the PC, the vast majority of those front-line games are delivered digitally.","Obviously that brings margin benefits for us as each new game gets delivered through digital channels, brings us gross margin benefits, and you'll see that in our overall corporate margin. We were at 32% this year, and with currency effects or excluding the currency effects, it would have been north of 34%. So overall, we think that trend is going to continue on the console side, particularly on the front side, and it will be a nice tailwind for us for 2016 and beyond.","Thomas Tippl - Chief Operating Officer","Chris, the vast majority of what we create are zeroes and ones, and when you look out over 500 million people in the network, you're going to see for the first time we really have the opportunity to sell our products in virtually every country in the world on every type of device, whether it's a mobile device, a desktop device or a console. And so the most important thing for us is engagements across our communities and then the opportunities for delivering player investment follow from there.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","All right. Thank you. Well, we appreciate the time today, and we look forward to talking to you on our Q1 conference call in the spring.","Operator","This concludes today's presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today's call over to Amrita Ahuja. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment; and Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors discussed in the Risk Factor sections of our SEC filings, including our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC, and those indicated on the slide that is showing.","The forward-looking statements in the presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation, and while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after today, May 6, 2015, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.","I would like to note that certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games, expenses related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, expenses, including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals related to the purchase transaction, and related debt financing and the associated tax benefits.","Please refer to our earnings release which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation. There's also a PowerPoint overview which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary sheet.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Amrita. Usually I end my remarks by thanking our incredibly talented, extraordinarily committed employees around the world, but today I'm leading with it because they are, in fact, the reason we remain one of the world's most successful game companies. And also, during this quarter, for the first time we were recognized by Fortune as one of the 100 best companies to work for.","Inclusion on this list is largely determined by employee survey results and to be recognized as a great place to work by a respected institution like Fortune is gratifying and rewarding, but being acknowledged as a great institution by our own people means more to me than just about anything. And I'd like to thank our wildly talented, inspired, driven, and hard-working teams for everything they do to capture the imagination of tens of millions of people day after day.","Our talented teams around the world continue to create experiences that inspire our players, drive deeper levels of engagement in our games by our massive and growing global community's events (3:36). In the last 12 months we had over 150 million active users around the world playing our games for more than 12 billion hours and spectators watching over 1 billion hours of linear content based on our games.","In the hour we'll spend on this conference call, we expect over 1 million people to interact with Activision Blizzard franchises alone. And in the past year our communities grew by more than 25%. This deepening level of engagement with a widening base of players across our franchises is what drove another successful quarter.","We delivered better than expected Q1 results, increased our 2015 non-GAAP revenue outlook to $4.425 billion, and our earnings per share outlook to $1.20 per share. On a non-GAAP basis we delivered record higher margin digital revenues of over $0.5 billion dollars, a first quarter record on an absolute basis and an all-time high on a percentage basis.","As we celebrate our 35th anniversary, we continue to create extraordinary entertainment for our fans. We couldn't be more excited to continue to do so for another 35 years. Our greatest achievement continues to be our ability to attract and retain the most talented employees around the world. And because of that I have never been more excited or confident about our future. And now I'll turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our better than expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2, and our increased outlook for 2015.","Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends on our year-round monetizing franchises. We overperformed our non-GAAP February guidance by over $60 million on revenue, $100 million on operating income, and $0.11 on EPS. Even though we had a relatively lighter slate in Q1 this year, non-GAAP revenue and EPS were flat to Q1 last year on a constant FX basis given strong digital trends. Non-GAAP digital revenues comprised a record percentage of overall revenues, up 800 basis points year-over-year.","Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Also the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted.","For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 15% year-over-year, an operating margin of 43% up from 37% last year, and a record quarterly GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 33% year-over-year and up $0.16 versus our February guidance.","For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $703 million, an operating margin of 29% and EPS of $0.16. Of the $0.11 in non-GAAP EPS overperformance versus guidance, about $0.05 was related to timing for costs that shifted out of the quarter, and about $0.06 was related to strong franchise momentum including digital sales and engagement trends with our large community of fans. Activision Publishing had a strong season pass, downloadable content, and expansion attach rates on both Call of Duty and Destiny. Console full game downloads represent a high teen share of total units and continue to increase year-over-year.","Blizzard Entertainment had steady and strong performance on Hearthstone with ongoing engagement on the Q4 expansion Goblins vs Gnomes. As mentioned during our February earnings call and consistent with our experience following prior expansions, we saw a decline in World of Warcraft subscribers. Subscribers ended the quarter at 7.1 million.","World of Warcraft's revenue performance at constant FX has been more stable driven by continued strong uptake on value-added services and price increases in select regions, which partially offset the subscriber declines particularly in the east. Moreover, Blizzard has successfully expanded their portfolio over the recent past and continues to do so. Growth from franchises like Hearthstone and Diablo have boosted Blizzard's top line and have pushed Blizzard's non-World of Warcraft revenue stream from 30% of total revenue in 2013 to 40% of total revenue in 2014, even while the World of Warcraft revenues also increased in that period. And new franchises like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm are expected to further expand non-World of Warcraft revenue to more than 50% share of the Blizzard business in 2015.","So strong recurring franchise diversification is in process inside the Blizzard portfolio, which sets us up for a bright 2016 and beyond.","Turning to specific P&L items, please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q1 GAAP product costs were 20%, operating expenses were 37%, and operating margin was 43%. GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense was $50 million and our GAAP tax rate was 20%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted share count was 741 million including participating securities. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 21%, operating expenses were 50%, and operating margin was 29%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%.","In terms of cash flow in Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $223 million, operating cash flow of $209 million, and free cash flow of $188 million after CapEx. We also repaid $250 million of our term loan in February, and next week, on May 13th, we plan to pay a $0.23 per share cash dividend or approximately $167 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30.","Turning to the balance sheet, as of March, 31, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments of which over $1 billion was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of $360 million.","Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on our February call, currency fluctuations continue to be a headwind that we will monitor. In Q1 the year-over-year impact of the strengthening dollar was $68 million on revenue and $0.03 on EPS. As mentioned, both revenue and EPS would have been flat year-over-year at constant FX. In summary, Q1 was a very strong start to the year for Activision Blizzard.","So, now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q2 and for the balance of 2015. Our expected Q2 slate from Activision Publishing includes additional downloadable content releases from Call of Duty and Destiny and continued live operations during the open beta for Call of Duty Online in China.","Blizzard Entertainment's Q2 slate is a robust offering across the portfolio including Hearthstone's new adventure, Blackrock Mountain, Hearthstone's important iOS and Android smartphone releases, Diablo III's launch in China, StarCraft: Legacy of the Void's closed beta, and Heroes of the Storm's launch in June. In Q2 we also expect to begin the ramp in sales and marketing spending for our major releases in the back half of the year.","Now to the numbers. For Q2 on a GAAP basis we expect net revenues of $930 million, product costs of 20% and operating expenses of 52%. We expect a GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 25%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 745 million, and EPS of $0.21. For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $650 million, product costs of 19%, and operating expenses of 63%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.07.","Our expected Q3 and Q4 slate from Activision Publishing is one of the strongest we've ever had, including the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which we are very excited about, a new innovative release for Skylanders, and the return of one of our most beloved IPs with Guitar Hero Live, as well as further ramp up of our audience playing Call of Duty Online in China. Blizzard Entertainment will bring additional content and live service updates to World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, as well as bring Overwatch into closed beta.","Now to our 2015 full-year numbers. For 2015 on a GAAP basis we expect revenues of $4.25 billion, an increase of $110 million versus our guidance in February, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 50%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP we expect interest expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.09 from the February guidance.","For 2015 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, $25 million higher than our February guidance, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 45%, and an operating margin of 31%, 100 basis points better than the February guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.","For the year we are raising our full year outlook by $0.05 to $1.20. As I mentioned earlier, strong business momentum in Q1 amounted to $0.06 of EPS favorability, which is partially offset by $0.01 of FX headwind, given the further strengthening of the dollar since we last gave guidance in February. See our accompanying earning materials for FX assumptions.","So in summary the transition to digital continues inside of our business, helping to further drive our year-round engagement and monetization model, where our community can play and invest in their experiences throughout the entire year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms, and geographies are paying off and set the stage for growth ahead.","Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg - Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing is off to a great start, and in Q1 we significantly outperformed last year's results with revenues up 28% year-on-year. We have two of the top five video game franchises globally year-to-date. We continue to have three of the top five next-gen games life to date, with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare remaining the number one title on next-gen, as it has since its launch six months ago. Including toys, Skylanders is also the number one console franchise and title globally in Q1, outsold the number one action figure line globally and of course was the number one kids console franchise and title globally.","Over the past few years we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio which now includes three industry-leading franchises, each one of which keeps players engaged all year-round. This engagement creates a virtuous cycle, great content leading to large engaged communities, leading to our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content. This is why we had the biggest Q1 online player community in our history, up double-digit percentages year-over-year and it is also why, based on our current trajectory, Activision Publishing will likely deliver our biggest year yet of digital revenues.","So let me share a few more specifics by franchise starting with Call of Duty. In the first quarter revenue was up by a double-digit percentage year-over-year, due to the strong sell through of Advanced Warfare and growing online revenues per user across our recent Call of Duty titles. Sales of season pass and map packs were up significantly, and we introduced a new consumable digital mechanic in Advanced Warfare which drove engagement and allowed our players to invest more deeply in their online experience.","We recently revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops III from award winning studio, Treyarch. Nearly 100 million players have played Black Ops and Black Ops II, making Black Ops the most played series in Call of Duty history. In fact, Call of Duty: Black Ops II originally released in 2012, continues to exhibit record-setting engagement this long after release with millions of actively engaged players who are now eager for the next installment of the series.","Black Ops II is Treyarch's first three-year development cycle, and they've been making the most of it with unparalleled depth of content across three modes of play. The campaign can be played as a full single player game or as a co-op game with up to four players. The multi-player experience is the deepest we've ever offered in Call of Duty, and the mind blowing third mode, Call of Duty: Zombies experience features its own XP progression system for the first time.","Another benefit of the three-year cycle is that we've been able to get the press hands-on with the game earlier than ever before, and the response has been phenomenal. In fact, positive media sentiment is double what it was last year, and mind you, last year was our previous high water mark.","We're confident that anyone who gets their hands on the game will agree, which is why we're going to have hands-on multiplayer at E3, as well as this year our first beta in years. Fans who pre-order the game now on Xbox One or PlayStation 4 or PC will have access to the beta.","On to Call of Duty Online which commenced open beta in January in China, the largest gaming market in the world. We're seeing good early trend, especially with high engagement from core first person action players. As we said on our last call, this is a game and a business model that will take time to ramp, and we're now working with our partner Tencent to expand our audience base. We continue to be enthusiastic, both about the opportunity in China, and about the long-term prospects for our game.","Turning now to Destiny, which continues to have incredible online engagements from millions of active players. In fact, these players are still playing on average about three hours a day, as they have been since launch, with strong digital sales and expansion attach rates. In all, Destiny has now received 299 awards, including 31 wins for Game of the Year, most recently adding Action Game of the Year from DICE and Game of the Year at the BAFTAs. And every day, our great partner at Bungie continues to make the game and online experience better.","Later this month we plan to launch Destiny's second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, yet another great piece of content to keep our fans engaged. And in the fall, we'll have a major release, which will be the biggest content addition yet to the Destiny universe, and you'll hear more about that soon.","On to Skylanders, the industry's top console franchise and title of year so far. Skylanders has its own unique engagement and monetization loop, real world toy purchases that enable new and different play experiences in the game, and which roll out in waves for our fans throughout the year. As with our other franchises, Skylanders' average revenue per user has grown year-over-year. And while the toys to life category that we created is increasingly competitive, we believe it remains highly attractive, and one that we will continue to lead with industry-best innovation and gameplay. We'll have more details to share soon about the next installment in the Skylanders franchise, which will once again bring fresh innovation to the category and expand the audience even further.","Finally, Guitar Hero: in April, we announced a fall 2015 return for the beloved franchise, which has been played by over 40 million gamers. Consumers' affinity for the brand remains incredibly strong, and we've spent years developing meaningful, creative innovation. The new Guitar Hero game is one game with two ways to play. Guitar Hero Live lets fans rock real crowds with real reactions, and Guitar Hero TV is the world's first playable music video network, which offers hundreds of songs and additional content to constantly engage our players. The game will be available across console, smartphone and tablet devices. The fan and media response to our reveal has been overwhelmingly positive and we couldn't be more excited to share additional details later this summer.","Overall, we had a great start to 2015 across our portfolio of titles and we look forward to sharing more news with you at E3. So thanks. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Eric. Compared to last year's launch of Hearthstone, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, and presales for Warlords of Draenor, this year's Q1 was relatively quiet for Blizzard Entertainment. Despite this, we continue to have strong performance in terms of engagement. Without any major launches, Battle.net still ended the quarter with the largest Q1 player community in our history, up double digits percentage-wise year-over-year. This reflects ongoing strength across our portfolio of games.","On the World of Warcraft front, we launched the first Warlords of Draenor update in Q1, adding new content, Twitter integration and more. This update increased stability in the last few weeks of the quarter. Warlords of Draenor brought more players back than any previous expansion, and showed that even long time lapsed players will return when the right content is offered.","On that note, we recently revealed the next major update for the game, which will add a ton of new content that will appeal to players across a range of play styles. That's currently on our public test realm and we're looking forward to getting it into players' hands as quickly as possible.","We also announced the WoW Token System. Players who purchase a WoW Token priced at $20 can exchange that token with another player for gold. The player who received the token can then redeem it for one month's game time, or a set amount of play time in China. This provides two benefits: It enables players to pay for their subscriptions with their gold, and it provides players with a secure method for purchasing gold in game. We just launched World of Warcraft Tokens in April, so it's too early to see the long-term impact, but many players welcome the service and have been using it actively.","This was also a big quarter for Heroes of the Storm, our highly anticipated online team brawler. More than 11 million people have signed up for the closed beta test, which went live in January. We're seeing a lot of anticipation in the gaming community and we're continuing to collect great feedback from our beta testers as we drive toward the launch on June 2.","To showcase the action and depth that the game offers, we recently sponsored a collegiate eSports tournament, which we dubbed Heroes of the Dorm. Thousands of players formed teams at over 460 schools across the U.S. and Canada. And similar to March Madness, we created a 64-team bracket after a few qualifying rounds. Those teams then battled their way to the finals, which were televised live by ESPN.","This was the network's first ever live telecast of a collegiate eSports event. The competition was intense throughout the tournament and we saw the formation of many potential Heroes of the Storm college rivalries. I'd like to congratulate the Cal Berkeley Golden Bears on their championship victory. We also saw widespread positive commentary across a range of online communities about the event. This is a testament to the fact that Heroes of the Storm is not only fun to play, it's fun to watch. We think it has great potential as a spectator sport.","Q1 was also an important quarter for Hearthstone. Despite no new content releases, engagement and revenues were steady quarter-over-quarter and in fact have remained relatively stable since launch. The performance for the quarter was driven by a sustained pick-up of Goblins vs Gnomes. Players have really enjoyed the mechanics of the new cards, and we've seen some incredibly creative deck strategies.","During the last two weeks of March, we held presales for our second adventure, Blackrock Mountain. We were pleased to see that enthusiasm for the new content was even stronger than it was with Curse of Naxxramas last August, with 40% more sales in the same timeframe. That enthusiasm continued with the launch of Blackrock Mountain in April which was followed by the iPhone and Android phone versions of Hearthstone a few weeks later.","The mobile phone versions pushed Hearthstone to the number one spot for game downloads in over 25 countries across North America, Europe and Asia, and quickly drove the game to a new milestone of more than 30 million players. Hearthstone continues to be very popular with players worldwide and we're already hard at work on our next release for the game.","We also recently started beta testing the Chinese version of Diablo III together with NetEase in March. There has been a lot of anticipation for the game in China with about 3 million players signing up for the closed beta test. Two weeks ago we launched the open beta test, opening up the game to everyone else in China. Chinese players are able to access the base experience for free and can buy much of the content from Reaper of Souls via an add-on, which is already available for purchase across two offerings priced at $32 and $64. In fact, we just announced with NetEase that Diablo III has already achieved over 1 million unit sales in China, which is a fantastic reception from the community. We look forward to building on that momentum as we drive towards the commercial launch.","Lastly, at the end of the quarter we kicked off the closed beta test for Legacy of the Void, the final chapter of StarCraft II. We know the StarCraft community is eager to play through the conclusion of the story and we've already seen great positive feedback about the game's new multi-player features.","Archon Mode, which allows two players to team up and share control of an army has gotten a very enthusiastic response. We're excited about this feature in particular because it greatly increases accessibility for the game. As I mentioned previously, Legacy of the Void will be a stand-alone expansion that doesn't require either of the first two releases. So, it will be easier than ever for players to get into the game and experience all of the latest content.","On the eSports side, Season 1 of the StarCraft II World Championship Series came to an exciting conclusion with our finals event in France at the beginning of April. Season 2 is now underway and the finals are set to take place at the Metro Convention Center in Toronto at the end of June. It's a thrill to see the top StarCraft II players in the world compete for a spot in the global finals, so I hope you'll tune in online if you can't make it in person.","To recap, we had a great start to the year. With more games in more genres and on more platforms than ever before, it doesn't look like things will be slowing down any time soon. We announced that BlizzCon 2015 will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on November 6 and November 7, and tickets for the event sold out quickly once again. We're going to have a lot to talk about at the show as well as in the months ahead. So now I will turn the call over to Thomas.","Thomas Tippl - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll take a moment to summarize the key takeaways from today's call. First, 2015 is off to a great start. We over-delivered the plan for Q1 and raised our full year guidance, which now projects year-over-year EPS growth from operations. And even more important for the long-term prospects of our business, we saw a 25% increase in the size of the player community that engages with our games.","That leads me to the second key takeaway from today's call. We are successfully transitioning our business to a digital year-round engagement model, where our community can play and invests in their experiences not just at launch but throughout the year. This is important because it allows us to improve the player experience by delivering fresh content on a frequent basis while at a time creating value for our shareholders through deeper and higher margin monetization of the audiences we serve.","Lastly, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms, and geographies continue to pay off, and along with growing engagement and better monetization sets the stage for growth ahead. We are well underway to expanding our franchise portfolio from five to over ten, with four new intellectual properties already in market. The two IPs we launched last year, Destiny and Hearthstone, combined now have over 50 million registered players and nearly $1 billion in non-GAAP revenues to life to date.","We have two new free-to-play franchises if beta, Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm. We also recently announced that this fall, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return, with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about. And Overwatch is on the horizon with a beta this fall. We have an increasing focus on mobile and tablet, with Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones, and Guitar Hero Live's planned release to also include mobile and tablet at launch.","Finally, we are positioned for growth in new geographies and in particular in the large and fast-growing China market. We now have six franchises in the market in China, World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Diablo, and Call of Duty Online, up from two at the beginning of last year.","So now let's take a few questions.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And we will take our first question from Eric Handler at MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes, thanks for taking my question. First for Mike, with regards to Hearthstone, I think you touched on this briefly, but with the addition of the smartphone SKUs, how is that increased player engagement as well as impacted on monetization? And then I wonder if you have a data about how many players are actually playing on multiple devices?","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the question. The response to the phone version has really been very positive globally. We've seen an increase in new players. As I said, it's pushed us past the 30 million player mark. We're very excited about that. Overall engagement and revenue levels have increased meaningfully with the release of the phone version, and they continue to be strong. So we're not breaking down usage across platforms, but I think it is important to note that Hearthstone is a little bit unique, and that is a shared ecosystem. So many of our players do choose to play across multiple platforms and they have access to the same cards regardless of which platform they're playing on.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Collin Sebastian at Robert Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And congrats on another good quarter. It sounds like the initial reception for Black Ops III has been quite positive, and wondering if you could add a little more specific color on how the three-year development cycle is benefiting the game. And then how it will be differentiated from prior versions of Black Ops and even from Advanced Warfare. I think on the surface at least there appear to be some similarities between the titles. Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Thanks, Colin. Well, the first and I think most obvious advantage of the three-year cycle is just pure creative quality. That third year allows us more time to innovate and iterate and more time to polish and this is Treyarch's first Call of Duty game with that time period to develop.","So, the first answer is it's just going to be a great game. Secondly, you've heard a lot of talk today about driving engagement being key to our business strategy, and as I mentioned Black Ops is the most played series in Call of Duty's history. But beyond just that pedigree of both Treyarch and the Black Ops series, the three-year cycle has also allowed us to put a deeper offering on the disk.","The MP, the multi-player game is going to be the deepest and we think the stickiest we've ever made. The Zombies is going to be deeper than ever and it's going to have our first XP progression system, which we think will also drive engagement. And, of course, the campaign has big innovations in it as well. As I mentioned, you can play it as a single player game or as a co-op game with up to four friends. So, that drives not only increased engagement but replayability because there's more variability in the experience.","In terms of the differences with past Black Ops games and Advanced Warfare, the answer is honestly we're building on the successes of all of those games, but we're also bringing a lot of fresh ideas. I understand what you mean when you say you see similarities with Advanced Warfare, I think the movement system in Black Ops III picks up where Advanced Warfare left off, but improves it and makes it more athletic and intuitive and smoother than ever before, and that's been a big theme we've heard from the press who got hands on with the game at Reveal, which we've never been able to do before, which is another good advantage of the three-year cycle.","So, I think anyone who gets their hands on the game is going to agree, which is why we're doing hands on at E3 for the first time in MP in a long while as well as our first beta in years. So, we're really bullish on the content and think it's going to be a great experience.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","We'll go next to Arvind Bhatia at Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Thank you very much and like to add my congratulations as well. Quick question on Heroes of the Storm. Just wondering \u2013 we appreciate all the commentary, Mike. Just wondering if you can maybe talk about the monetization opportunity here this year and then just the ramp you're expecting over the coming years and maybe how you differentiate versus your competition? Thank you.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks. Well, first, we're really excited that the launch is just a few weeks away occurring on June 2nd. The team has really worked hard in fine-tuning the experience to make it fast, fun and easy to get into. And I do think that relative to some of the other options in the genre, it is easier to get into Heroes, and I think judging by the response that we've gotten from our recent Heroes of the Dorm tournament, I think it's easier to watch as well. The feedback that we've been getting from the closed beta tests has been very positive. There's a lot of great buzz around the game.","We've had, like I said, over 11 million people signing up for the beta test, so there's a lot of anticipation there. As you know, it's a very popular genre. I think the fact that this is a digital game with long-term content, opportunities we're very optimistic about Heroes of the Storm and how it can grow to become another key game in our portfolio. And I think in terms of how the monetization curve will look, we expect to get started strong on June 2 and we are hoping that that will grow over time.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Doug Creutz at Cowen & Company.","Doug L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Yeah, you guys only invest in projects if you believe there's a meaningful needle-moving opportunity. And obviously Guitar Hero was a property that moved the needle for you several years ago. But since then the market has changed a lot particularly relating to what casual gamers are doing these days. So, what do you see in the market now that leads you to believe that this can be a profitable investment for you? Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg - Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. Well, yeah, a lot has changed in the market in that time, and we think for the better in terms of our prospects with Guitar Hero. The first thing is that we think we have a great game innovation and that the franchise needs that. And we said when we put it on ice five years ago, that we wouldn't bring it back unless we really had a breakthrough creative way to bring it back and we think that we have that.","In terms of the way the market itself has changed, first of all online social play has transformed gaming over the past five years, and GHTV is going to be constantly updated with new content to keep the game fresh and to keep people engaged and it also allows people to compete online with their friends in a highly social way. We think this has the potential to have the kind of sticky long tail engagement that defines the rest of our portfolio and our major franchises.","Second, the game's been out of market for five years and during that time, we've had a console transition. We now have powerful new consoles in the marketplace that give us the opportunity to deliver that rock star fantasy in a more vivid and visceral way than ever before, which is what the live mode is really going to do.","Third is mobile has had explosive growth over the last five years with casual players. And one of the breakthrough innovations is that you'll be able to have the entire experience on mobile, and this is a great experience both on the go, on the glass, or with the full experience with the guitar and your big screen TV. So we think that's a big innovation for us and a big opportunity for us as well.","And finally, as I mentioned at the Reveal, we've improved and innovated on the guitar itself, managing to make it both easier and more accessible to a casual player, while also managing to make it more challenging than ever for an advanced player.","So we think we're going to widen the appeal of the game in that score as well. And also we mentioned that guitar is going to be forward compatible with any additional games that come out. That's going to be a better consumer experience we think this time around. It's going to focus us on innovating on the software and keeping the game more engaging as opposed to the hardware like last time around.","Doug L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thanks Eric.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon everyone. So as it relates to Destiny, Eric, can you talk about in more detail the plans around the more expansive DLC coming in the fall you that you alluded to and to the extent you're willing to discuss any updates on future console titles for this franchise? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Yeah, of course I would love to, Drew, but we don't have any new announcements today. But obviously, a constant stream of robust content is integral to our plans on Destiny. And I would say both the expansiveness of the universe as well as the innovation that Bungie has established with bringing together the best of both first person action games with MMORG (sic) [MMORPG] (37:25) has led Destiny to become already I think one of the most engaging games ever.","As I said, the active Destiny player is still playing for about three hours a day, which is just remarkable amounts of engagement from a large and passionate player base. So this points to exactly the kind of model that I spoke about for all of our games, great content leading to large audiences, leading to our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content.","So the answer is we have a very robust content plan for Destiny starting with our second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, which has already been announced. And then, you'll also see content being dropped throughout the summer, and then in the fall we'll have a major release, which will be the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet across all modes of play. Unfortunately, I don't have more details than that today, but we're confident it's going to be incredibly appealing not just to our current fans, but also to people who haven't yet joined the Destiny universe. It's going to be that big of an expansion.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks, Eric.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. A quick question on digital. What was your mix of digital business in the quarter? And can you provide any commentary on how this is trending? Thanks.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, thanks Brian. It's Dennis here. Just regards to the digital mix, it's obviously the highest we've ever had on a quarterly percentage. It was at 76% for the quarter. And you look back a couple of years ago, our digital mix was in the mid-30%s for the full year 2013. In full year 2014 it got into the mid-40%s, and obviously we're out of the blocks really strong in the beginning of this year. It's really driven by the full game download on the console, which is obviously transitioning over time. We're now seeing in the high teens in terms of percentage mix of revenue. And then across the business and really across all of our franchises is the add-on digital content and services that we're seeing to drive ongoing player engagement that all of the guys have talked about today. So all of this is really driving that mix up, and we'll see that continue to grow north of 50% across this year. It will be a nice tailwind for the business in the coming years.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our final question today from Michael Olson at Piper Jaffray.","Yung Rok Kim - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Thank you for taking the call. This is Yung Kim in for Mike. Activision's made a significant push into eSports between Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Dorm. How should we think about the opportunity there? Is it more marketing or is it directly monetizable?","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a great question. This is Bobby. For starters, what we've always found eSports has been a great way for us to celebrate our players, and that's really been the principal focus of the company's initiatives.","There may be commercial opportunities in the future. In fact, we expect there will be more commercial opportunities in the future, but right now you have so many players around the world who dedicate so much of their time and their energy and their passion playing our games that we never really want to take that for granted, and this is a way to celebrate them.","You've seen a lot of value created so far with star players. We have players who are earning over $1 million a year between endorsements and winnings. Then you've seen opportunities for shoutcasters at professional events who are also earning meaningful revenues. And then for our players themselves who are narrating their own game play and are now starting to develop millions of fans.","And then we have gamers who are competing in prize events like Blizzard's Heroes of the Dorm that we just hosted last weekend. We gave away college scholarships to Berkeley, the winning team. And we recently also had the Call of Duty championships where we paid out $1 million dollars in prize money.","So if you look at the numbers of spectators that are now watching gameplay, you're probably looking at just for our content alone last year somewhere around 1 billion hours of spectating of linear play. And so from a lot of perspectives it's something that when we look out into the future, we are incredibly excited about, both as a way to really recognize our player's investment and commitment but also from a commercial perspective.","Yung Rok Kim - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Amrita Ahuja, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Amrita Ahuja - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's first quarter 2018 conference call.","Before we start the call, we want to share with you an extraordinary error that was made by The Wall Street Journal earlier today, which caused trading volatility in our stock. The Wall Street Journal made a mistake and prematurely released a completely inaccurate headline, reporting our Q1 revenues as $1.7 billion instead of our actual Q1 2018 GAAP revenues of a record $1.97 billion. Not only did they report inaccurately, they did so in violation of our written embargo agreement. They have since issued an apology.","Our actual results are now clarified and reflect our strong performance and plans for growth, including a record first quarter well ahead of our outlook and consensus and increased guidance for 2018.","So today to review those results, we have with us: Bobby Kotick, CEO; Coddy Johnson, COO; and Spencer Neumann, CFO. And for Q&A Dennis Durkin, Chief Corporate Officer; Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.","A number of things could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and those on the slide that is showing. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after today, May 3, 2018.","We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call. We also provide non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, expenses including legal fees, costs, expenses, and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment; expenses related to debt financings and refinancings; restructuring charges and the associated tax benefits.","These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com, for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures.","There's also a PowerPoint overview which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary sheet.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us today. This was another record quarter for Activision Blizzard, with GAAP revenues of $1.97 billion, driven by record quarterly digital, in-game, and mobile net bookings. We also achieved an all-quarter record non-GAAP EPS of $0.78, surpassing our prior outlook by $0.13. And we generated record Q1 operating cash flow of $529 million, up nearly 30% year over year.","Our continued ability to set new records speaks to the breadth and enduring nature of our portfolio of franchises against the backdrop of a large and growing interactive industry.","Gaming is constantly evolving and innovating, which often expands the marketplace, and the success of Fortnite is no exception. This game is attracting new players of all ages and gender and it is helping gaming become even more mainstream entertainment.","Our biggest franchises are anchored by communities of tens of millions of players. And while many of our players try new games, they always come back to the franchises that are the foundation of the communities that they are a part of.","World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Candy Crush are great examples. These longstanding franchises are driving innovation into games at a regular pace with new in-game content, social features, and regular updates added to their ever-evolving rich game universes. World of Warcraft is on a very positive trajectory, with strong presales for the upcoming expansion content. And Candy Crush is demonstrating growth, holding both the number one and two grossing mobile spots in the U.S. for the second quarter in a row.","We see strength across the whole portfolio, including Overwatch, where total franchise engagement is up, and Call of Duty, where the digital season and reach have been strongly ahead of last year. And of course, we're all very excited about the highly anticipated Black Ops 4 release.","Gaming remains the most engaging form of entertainment, and it's projected to grow faster than any form of media except messaging, even faster than social media in terms of time spent. We estimate that the interactive entertainment industry exceeded $120 billion in total revenues last year and grew at 20% year over year. We are the largest standalone interactive entertainment company, and yet we represent less than 10% of this rapidly growing industry, which illustrates the sizable opportunity we see ahead.","Our core games business has always been our growth engine in terms of results and intellectual property creation. That will only get stronger as we focus on two especially large opportunities ahead of us. First, mobile gaming, which represents a unique opportunity for us to dramatically expand our reach to new and existing players, and we're leveraging our powerful franchises across the company in the creation of our new mobile franchises and titles. Second, we have room to grow our high-margin and recurring in-game revenue streams through a persistent focus on continuing to add value to all of our players' experiences.","We continue to be the leading innovators in professional esports. The inaugural regular season of the Overwatch League is progressing well, with millions of viewers each week and average viewing time of over an hour, which provides our multiple global broadcast partners and sponsors with access to a highly engaged and hard-to-reach audience.","The Overwatch League continues to thrive, and our players are getting even broader recognition of their incredible talents in mainstream media. We see even greater opportunity with the playoffs and Grand Finals still to come. And we've begun sales of our next round of Overwatch League teams. And over time, we believe our esports initiatives could rival traditional sports for audience interest, advertiser interest, sponsors, ticket sales, and merchandise sales, both virtual and physical.","Our five-year growth plan is in its earliest innings, and our greatest challenge remains prioritization of opportunity, which is an enviable challenge to have. We have the finest talent in our industry, and we continue to attract the very best and brightest people, drawn to the excitement, opportunity, and rewards our company provides.","We have a very exciting remainder of this year, and we thank you, our shareholders, as well our talented driven teams around the world for all of your support.","Now Coddy will review the highlights of our operations of this record quarter.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Bobby. As Bobby said, Activision Blizzard had another record quarter, growing year over year and setting top and bottom line records. We were able to deliver these results because of our incredible teams with some of the world's best creative, technical, and operational talent, because of our passionate communities and strong franchises, which have some of the world's most dedicated and engaged players, spectators, and fans. And because our teams continue to find more and more ways to serve our communities in those franchises with ongoing year-round streams of content, features, and services, so that even in quarters without large content releases, we can deliver records.","Before diving into the specifics of the quarter, it's worth building on what Bobby shared about one of the genres where we already have some of the world's largest franchises and communities, the shooter genre. The new battle-round modes that have recently entered the space have compelling survivor mechanics and large in-game player pools. They have also brought tens of millions of completely new players into gaming, both on traditional platforms like console and PC, but also on newer platforms for the genre like mobile. We are very, very encouraged by this.","The shooter genre was already one of the largest and growing. We are already one of the largest players in that space. New modes that attract new players bring us new opportunities to expand our own communities and to benefit from the significant pipeline of innovation that we have planned for our franchises.","As you saw this quarter, many of our franchises delivered records, with continued success across our three strategic pillars of reach, engagement, and player investment. On reach, the company had 374 million monthly active users this quarter. And for the second quarter in a row, King stabilized its player base of overall monthly active users just slightly down from last quarter and overall engagement remaining strong, with King's daily time spent per user at record levels. Importantly, the largest part of King's audience, Candy Crush monthly active users on mobile, grew for the second quarter in a row. And King plans to grow its network even further with new game launches planned for later this year and beyond.","Activision's successful 2017 launches for Call of Duty, Destiny, and Crash Bandicoot continue to draw large audiences, with 51 million monthly active users this quarter, up 7% over last year. Call of Duty grew year over year with players engaging across the franchise, including in Call of Duty: World War II. And as we look ahead to the fall, Activision plans to again be number one globally with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.","The studio behind the Black Ops franchise is Treyarch, known for innovation and highly engaging games, with Black Ops sub-franchise drawing over 200 million players and 15 billion hours played to date. Treyarch is now hard at work to deliver yet another amazing game. And everything about it will be community and engagement first, giving players more of the gameplay features and modes that they love and bringing all of it to players earlier than ever before in October. Tune in on May 17 when Activision will share more at the Black Ops 4 global reveal.","Now on our last call, we talked about the Destiny 2 sentiment issues and the plan to address them. The next step in that plan is the launch of Destiny 2's second expansion, Warmind, set for next week, featuring fresh updates and new content from our partner Bungie that make the gameplay more rewarding and the endgame more fulfilling. Bungie has a number of additional updates planned for the remainder of the year as well as a large expansion in the fall.","Activision continues to bring its rich library of owned IP back to some of the world's most passionate fans. Crash Bandicoot's launch on Facebook last year was a phenomenal success. And Activision plans to bring Crash to new audiences this summer on additional platforms like PC, Xbox One, and Switch. And then in September, Activision will release a new remastered collection of Spyro the Dragon on PlayStation and Xbox. Like Crash, it will be three games in one, the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. And what we know is that when we bring back our beloved IP in the right way, the community responds. And the Spyro reveal trailer has already had tens of millions of views, and preorders are well ahead of expectations.","Blizzard continues to engage audiences across platforms with 38 million monthly active users this quarter. World of Warcraft is releasing more content more regularly than ever before, leading to higher engagement sequentially, over-performance versus the prior expansion at this point in time, and strong community participation with in-game purchases. The next expansion, Battle for Azeroth, launches worldwide on August 14 and is already off to a great start, with preorders ahead of plan.","Hearthstone continued to reach and engage its large global audience last quarter, first with a novel promotion of under the Year of the Mammoth, which offered new and existing players a chance to expand their decks and gameplay at a great value. Blizzard also recently released a new player versus environment mode, Monster Hunts, on the back of the most recent expansion, and engagement has been great so far.","Overwatch continues to grow its community and engagement remains strong, with the most recent seasonal event, Retribution, having the highest participation rate to date. Now Overwatch's performance is driven by a commitment to the player community. And with its ongoing stream of seasonal events, maps, and heroes, Overwatch was recently recognized as the world's best evolving game.","To that end, Overwatch has now added new and innovative links between the game and the spectating experience for Overwatch League, which brings me to our second pillar, deepening engagement. Esports is, as you know and as Bobby said, a priority for the company. It's where we celebrate player achievement and community passion and provide awesome spectating experiences for a rapidly growing number of esports fans, nowhere more so than Overwatch League, which continues to reach millions each week.","We are seeing increased engagement for the franchise overall, with the hours combined spent playing and watching Overwatch growing quarter over quarter. And as Bobby said, this is even before the playoffs and Grand Finals later this summer. Overwatch League and its partners also introduced new engagement programs like token drops, cheermotes, and the new Twitch league pass, which deliver even better viewing experiences and new revenue opportunities.","And given all this progress, there is very strong demand for Overwatch League expansion teams. The league will therefore be highly selective in this approach, adding just a handful of teams in key strategic markets by end of year. More broadly, building out the Overwatch League allowed the company to develop a unique set of capabilities and infrastructure, and we plan to begin applying them to other franchises in the near future, including to Call of Duty. To that end, Call of Duty's 2018 World League completed its first phase in mid-April and continues to have strong viewership, with cumulative hours watched doubling year over year.","Turning last to our third strategic pillar, player investment, in-game content features and services continue to both engage our fans and contribute significantly to our results, delivering a Q1 record of $1 billion of in-game net bookings. King continues to drive player investment and had its highest net bookings quarter since Q1 of 2015, with 3% sequential growth and 13% growth year over year. And for its core business on mobile, King had its highest net bookings quarter ever.","Just as importantly, the absolute number of paying players increased quarter over quarter. And for over four years, King has had two of the top 10 games in U.S. app stores. And now, for the second quarter in a row, King had the top two games with Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga, once again showing the remarkable durability of this franchise. King is also ramping up its advertising business. Supported by industry-leading viewability, completion, and ad recall rates, King continues to attract new advertisers and importantly has repeat advertises now coming across multiple industries.","Finally, on player investment, Call of Duty's strong launch last year led to growth year on year for in-game net bookings with World War II 's Q1 second only to that of Black Ops III. And there's more on horizon for Call of Duty fans this digital season, including additional in-game content and seasonal events.","So looking back, we had a great quarter that was a result of strong franchises with incredible teams innovating on behalf of passionate and growing communities. Looking ahead, we have a growth path that builds on these strengths and, as Bobby said, over time increasingly includes mobile as a primary building block that expands our player and spectator communities. We are investing in our core franchises on mobile. And as I said on the last call, we hope to see early results later this year with more meaningful impact in future years.","In summary, our franchises are as strong as ever. We are investing and building internal capabilities for the future with mobile, esports, advertising, and other forms of content and all the while delivering record results.","Spencer now will review those numbers in more detail.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Coddy. Today I'll review our better than expected Q1 2018 results as well as our outlook for the full year. Once again, we outperformed our guidance thanks to our incredibly talented teams, our strong global portfolio of owned intellectual property, our compelling offerings of year-round content, and our commitment to relentless prioritization and fiscal discipline.","Now turning to the specifics of the quarter, I'll start with our segment results, where revenue and operating income grew by double-digit percentages year over year, setting a new Q1 operating income record while we continued to invest in new capabilities. This performance was primarily driven by our in-game content, with net bookings growing by double-digit percentage year over year for all three segments.","King grew segment revenue by 13% year over year and operating income by 15%. Margins also improved year over year, with segment operating margin at 36%. The King teams focused on continually investing and innovating in its live titles resulted in the Candy Crush franchise achieving its highest net bookings since Q4 2013.","Activision grew segment revenue and operating income substantially year over year on the strength of Call of Duty: World War II. Growth in the Call of Duty digital season in particular drove a Q1 record for segment operating margin. Blizzard grew segment revenue to a new Q1 record, driven by in-game content across their portfolio of franchises, strong World of Warcraft presales, and the launch of the Overwatch League.","Margins decreased year over year, as Blizzard continues to invest in key growth initiatives, including the Overwatch League, MLG Network, Battle.net, and mobile incubation efforts. We expect these strategic investments to pay off in the coming years.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Before I continue, I wanted to quickly review ASC 606, the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. We've now adopted the new standard, which is reflected in our Q1 results. The prior-period results have not been restated. While ASC 606 affects our GAAP revenue recognition and some quarterly timing, it's not expected to materially impact our annual segment results, cash flows, or financial performance as reviewed for internal management purposes. Please refer to our 10-Q for more information.","Also, unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures, so please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter, we generated record Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.97 billion, $145 million above our February guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $581 million. Net bookings were also a Q1 record of $1.38 billion, which is $104 million above our February guidance. We generated an all-quarter record GAAP EPS of $0.65 and an all-quarter record non-GAAP EPS of $0.78, which was $0.13 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.40.","Now from a cash and capital structure perspective, our business performance continues to deliver strong cash flow, with record Q1 operating cash flow of $529 million, an increase of 29% over last year. We finished the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, $4.4 billion in aggregate debt outstanding, and a net cash position of roughly $860 million.","Looking ahead, we're maintaining our balanced approach to capital allocation, with board authorization to pay down as much as $1.8 billion of debt this year and plan to pay a cash dividend on May 9 of $0.34 per common share, which is a 13% increase over 2017.","We also recently had positive credit rating developments, receiving an upgrade from both Moody's and S&P. Each agency has now upgraded our rating three times in about 2.5 years, as we continue to demonstrate the strength, diversity, and recurring nature of our business.","Before I turn to the specifics of our upcoming slate and outlook, I'd like to provide some context. Based on the strength of our Q1 beat and our confidence in our franchises and pipeline, we are raising our full-year outlook modestly. As I said on our last call, we expect revenues and operating income for 2018 to be more back-end loaded than 2017 given the timing of our content slate relative to the prior year.","For example in Q2 of last year, we had Black Ops III, Zombies remastered maps, the Crash launch, and the Diablo Necromancer update. While we don't have those launches in Q2 this year, we do have an amazing full-year lineup as well as a continuous stream of content, features, and services throughout Q2 and the year, as I'll discuss in a moment. In addition, the back half of this year features not only an exciting Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 but also another major release for the year with Blizzard's World of Warcraft expansion.","Now let's turn to the specifics of our slate and outlook for 2018. In terms of slate for Q2, for Activision, Call of Duty's digital season will continue with additional map packs, content, and events. Destiny 2 will release its second expansion along with other content and feature updates, and Crash will be released on additional platforms.","Earlier this month, Blizzard released a new Hearthstone expansion and Overwatch seasonal event. Blizzard also plans to release more content and features across its portfolio, including a second anniversary event for Overwatch. And of course, King will continue to deliver innovative live ops across its portfolio. In addition, marketing spend will begin to ramp in Q2 to support the heavy back-half release schedule.","So for Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect: net revenues of $1.555 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $205 million; product cost and game operations and distribution expenses of 22%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 57%. We expect GAAP net interest expense of $68 million, a GAAP tax rate of 23%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 771 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.26.","For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect: product costs and game operations and distribution expenses of 22%; operating expenses, including software amortization, of 48%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $30 million, a tax rate of 20%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, including the net recognition of deferrals of $0.15.","Now turning to the 2018 full-year outlook, our strong Q3-Q4 release slate includes not only Blizzard World of Warcraft expansion, Battle for Azeroth, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, but also Spyro the Dragon Reignited Trilogy, Destiny's major expansion, King's new launches, as well as the continued ramp of growth initiatives such as advertising.","Q1 over-performance benefited in part from timing, and we still have a lot to deliver in the year. Still, as I just mentioned, we feel great about the remainder of the year, and we're modestly raising our full-year outlook.","On a GAAP basis, we expect full-year revenues of $7.355 billion, including deferrals of $120 million; product costs and game operations and distribution expenses of 22% and operating expenses including software amortization of 53%. Our GAAP net interest expense is expected to be $135 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 18%. We expect 775 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.79.","For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs and game operations and distribution expenses of 22% and operating expenses including software amortization of 44%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $94 million, a tax rate of 20%, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.46, including deferrals of $0.05.","In summary, our results this quarter once again illustrate the power of our franchises. We expect them to continue to consistently deliver into the future while we invest prudently in exciting new businesses. And as always, we'll focus on fiscal discipline and operational excellence across the company.","Now I welcome Dennis, Mike, and Riccardo as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear first from Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe going back to Fortnite, I wanted to know if we can get any color on any impact on either engagement or monetization across some of your key titles. And what are the key learnings you have as a management team from what you've seen from Fortnite that you might apply to your own titles? Thanks so much.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure, Eric. This is Spence, I'll take this one. So as Bobby and Coddy mentioned earlier, the Battle Royale mode, it's contributing to the innovation and expansion we're seeing in the industry. It's not only bringing the younger audiences and millions of new gamers that both Coddy and Bobby mentioned into the shooter genre, where we're already a leader in the space, but importantly, it's also highlighting the ability to successfully bring immersive gaming experiences like Battle Royale to mobile in both Western and Eastern audiences, or markets I guess. And that's really encouraging as we think about our future mobile opportunities and our growth opportunities generally as gaming becomes increasingly mainstream.","So yes, we've seen some near-term impact from Battle Royale. But as you heard on the call today, our business continues to perform at record levels. We've got one of the broadest and most diverse portfolios of successful franchises across genres, across platforms, and across business models. And we're continuously innovating within those existing franchises, and we've got a really exciting future development pipeline. So when you put all that together, we feel great about where we're positioned and our ability to continue to deliver on our growth plans going forward.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","And, Eric, this is Bobby. I would just add the long history of our company. When we see people innovate in an interesting and impactful way, we are very quick to figure out how to capture inspiration from innovation. And so we as a company, in our DNA, in our culture, when we see things that appeal to our audiences, we are very good at being inspired by those.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll hear next from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Coming to Black Ops, how do you anticipate this edition of Black Ops will differ from historical Call of Duty games that you guys have released?","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Evan. This is Coddy. I'll take that one, and glad to. As I said in prepared remarks, Black Ops for us is going to be an awesome game, given the community, really just an incredible experience for us, gameplay features and modes. And we think not just for existing community members, but also for a significant number of new players that are coming into the shooter genre. There is a number of reasons for the strength of our belief. First is it's just Black Ops. It's the most played Call of Duty sub-franchise to date, and that's saying something in a franchise like Call of Duty, which had the success it's had.","The Black Ops III iterations so far over eight years have drawn in 200 million players and billions and billions of hours of gameplay. And by the way, that's still ongoing. As we speak, there is millions of people playing in the Black Ops franchise right now. And it leads to the second advantage, which is what we see from those billions of hours of gameplay, where we get to see in depth and real time what really engages our players. Black Ops 4 builds on that and on everything Treyarch has learned about what players love to play.","And so that's the third main area, is the confidence we have in Treyarch and their ability to execute on their creative vision. It's an incredible developer with a deep understanding of the community and the first-person genre, but also a real proven track record of innovation, including Zombies and multiple multi-player innovations that have really transformed the industry.","And it's a most important last point, which is that this is a game that's not going to just build on our strengths. It will continue to push the envelope in innovation. You'll see that in the core game itself, where we have a number of new exciting developments to roll out very soon, but also in the game's appeal on growth platforms like PC, where we've invested significant dedicated resources and design time to make sure we can deliver a great PC game to serve that community. So very soon, May 17, we'll have a lot more to say at the Black Ops 4 global reveal, and I hope you tune in. You should.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about how Overwatch League viewership has been trending relative your expectations so far. I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that you started a second round of team sales already, so maybe you could comment about how that's going and how we should be thinking about the value of the new teams you might sell. Thanks.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","So this is Bobby.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Go ahead, Bob.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sorry, you go first, Mike.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Okay. I wanted to say we're extremely happy with both the launch and how the inaugural season for Overwatch League has been going so far. The league is definitely outperforming our expectations, starting with viewership. Viewership has been very strong and consistent each week. We've had millions of fans tuning in, and our average viewer spends about an hour \u2013 over an hour of watching each day. Our broadcast partners like Twitch and MLG and our partners in China have been great.","We've also been introducing some exciting new engagement programs that are unique to esports. We have partnered with some great sponsors as well like HP, Intel, Toyota, T-Mobile, and Sour Patch Kids, and these sponsors now have access to a highly engaged and hard-to-reach audience. We've been adding to our esports team. We've recently added professionals with strong sports marketing and broadcast expertise. And so we think that overall this has been a great success. We think it's good for the whole ecosystem. It's good for owners, our owners who have partnered with us on this exciting new venture. It's great for the players, who have increased stability as well as a great venue to showcase their talent. And it's great for the Overwatch franchise, which has benefited from increased total engagement.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sorry, Mike. Go ahead.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Okay. With respect to team sales, we are currently in process. We've been meeting with potential new owners in new geographies. Demand has been really strong globally. We don't have an update on exact timing, but we do expect to add new teams to the league this year. And so looking ahead, we're heading towards the end of our inaugural season. We'll be holding our playoffs, Grand Finals, and an All Star game this summer. And so we've got a lot of great stuff planned. We're very excited. And I'll turn it over to Bobby.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","You said most of what I was going to say and probably better than I could have said it. But the only thing that I was going to point out is that for our almost 40 million players, what I think the league has really done is it's reinforced that the thing that they spend hours and hours a day playing is something that they feel like is now being validated in a way that it never has before in a video game.","And so all of our players in almost 190 countries around the world feel like this is truly a recognition of the sense of belonging that they get playing the game and the sense of accomplishment they feel playing the game. And I think more than anything, that's been an enormous benefit as a result of the creation of the league.","Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And from Sanford Bernstein, we'll hear from Todd Juenger.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'd like to ask about King, if I could, so probably for Riccardo. So, Riccardo, I'd love to hear what you can share with us about what you're continuing to do to drive the reach of King, and just any other general insights you have to share with us on current trends you're seeing in your space. Thanks.","Riccardo Zacconi - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Todd. This is Riccardo. So first of all, I would like to say that to grow again the reach is a key priority for us. So in Q1, we had 285 million monthly active users. This is slightly down sequentially, but we stabilized the active user base over the last several quarters, which I believe is a very important achievement. And if I look at the other metrics, these are also very encouraging. Daily active users were stable across the network. And specifically, daily active users in the Candy franchise increased slightly.","Now we have achieved this focusing primarily on the player experience in the live games. In live games, we have increased the pace of releasing fresh content. So we have released more levels. We have released live operations. We have released new features, and we will do more of this. Further on, we believe there is an opportunity to grow the reach, not only innovating in the game, but also innovating in the marketing.","Now, to change the trend more meaningfully requires major new game launches. Our best teams are at work building a great pipeline, and we have as we speak games at various stages of development. We have games at the conceptual level. We have game prototypes, and we have games in production. And we have games that we will release, as you heard earlier, this year.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Fantastic, thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious for an update on Destiny. Maybe talk about some of the challenges you've seen on it over the course of the last six months. And what are the biggest steps you think you need to implement in Destiny to fix it, bring back the users, and drive monetization higher?","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure, thanks. This is Coddy. I'll take that one. I guess the first thing, one of the best parts about Destiny is just how passionate and engaged that community is. And the bright side of that is it gives us the chance to really build and iterate upon the feedback. As I said in the prepared remarks, the three things that we know we're going to do and that the community is looking for is make the player more powerful, provide more rewards, and make the endgame more meaningful. As we look ahead, we have a chance to continue to build on that, particularly in feedback that really engages the community.","And so maybe just as an example to share, Bungie recently hosted a large cohort of the top worldwide Destiny players onsite up at their studio in Seattle. And they walked through the roadmap of features and updates they're planning, but they also gave hands-on with not just Warmind, the expansion coming out shortly, but also with a part of the big fall release planned for later this fall, and it was a very positive response to the three things I just mentioned, the power and the rewards and the need for endgame.","But even more of what's coming this fall into the innovations and gameplay there, including to what we think will be an incredibly engaging new mode, one that introduces a whole new style of play for first-person shooter gaming generally and certainly for the shooter space that Destiny created. It's a really exciting development. It's one of the things that we feel really speak to the community when it comes out in the fall, and we're really excited to share more about that. We won't do that until E3. So as to this next expansion, head over to E3. We hope we'll you see there and be able to talk more about it.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll hear now from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good afternoon, maybe back to Riccardo on King. Riccardo, could you update the expected timeline for more material King ad revenue? And can you talk about some of your findings during this testing period? And how extensive should we expect the raw to be as far as how much of the King portfolio is ready for advertising? And then lastly, will advertising change any game design or gameplay mechanics? Thank you.","Riccardo Zacconi - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Mike, Riccardo here. Thank you for your questions. Let me start first giving an update on how the business is going. So I'm pleased, I'm very pleased with the progress that our ad business has made in Q1. We hit an internal milestone. The business is still relatively small but was modestly profitable this quarter. So the goal is to build a strong long-term business, and we will ramp up further the investments during the year.","And the other thing we've done is, a key priority is to build a strong team, and we have continued to build out our leadership team and our capabilities in this area. We have made some key hires in product development, in B2B marketing, and in measurement and insights. And we have also continued to work on our ads product offering. We have introduced new placements and new times where ads appear in the player journey.","As Coddy mentioned earlier, our ad products perform well. Players are completing our reader views more than 90% of the time, and our ad recall rates are much higher than industry norm. Our ad teams are working very closely with the game teams to create ad experiences that are supportive of the gameplay. So for example, you can get a booster watching an ad, and that can help you in the game.","And in regards to the rollout of our ad business, currently ads are live in certain games, including the Candy Crush franchise, but we have not turned yet on ads for all the players in these games. We are taking a measured approach where we AB test before showing ads to new segments of players. So we expect the ad business to ramp throughout the year, particularly in the second half, as we serve more players.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Amrita Ahuja - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","We'll go now to Jefferies' Tim O'Shea.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes, thank you for taking my question. So there are some other big markets like China, like mobile, where free-to-play is the dominant business model already. So I'm just wondering if Fortnite's success, if it changes how you think about the $60 full-price business model for console games going forward. Thanks.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure. Hey Tim, this is Coddy. Thanks for the question. I'd say broadly we think in a growing industry like ours that there's room for multiple business models to succeed in parallel. We see this just in our own portfolio across Activision Blizzard. Right now, today, we have a full range of business models, free-to-play, subscription, upfront payments, downloadable content packs, ongoing micro transactions, all of these succeeding at scale. And so it's like there's no one in a better position to see the nature of how you think about bringing a value proposition to consumers.","We think it's true of our industry broadly as well, where that direct ongoing interactive connection with players and audiences, it allows an enormous amount of iteration and innovation on how to provide the most satisfying avenues for investment. We get to see that real time in the loop that we create and the things that we roll out.","But not just in interactive, we think there's a number of areas across broader entertainment that prove this out as well, where multiple business models work at the same time. Just in linear viewership, you have Netflix and YouTube, both coexisting, both growing, both with their own kind of value propositions. And for us, that's really the most important piece is the value proposition, the North Star. And for us, that is deeply compelling and engaging gameplay. When we get that right and we find the fun and deliver that rich, meaningful, ongoing experience for players, we think we have the ability to deliver the right business model that supports and adds to the experience. We do think $60 games will continue to be an important part of that equation. And we believe the level of investment in content, in features, and in services that we provide will continue to make that a very attractive proposition for players.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Coddy.","Operator","And our final question today will be from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks. My question is related to World of Warcraft, including higher engagement that you're seeing with the title. And in particular, I'm wondering what we should expect then in terms of WoW usage and engagement leading up to and following the launch of Azeroth this summer. Thank you.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Colin. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. Before I go into the expansion, I just want to quickly thank the World of Warcraft team for their amazing work in delivering great content for that community. Over the last couple of years, they have really shifted their pipelines and invested in not only the expansions, but also creating ongoing and an increasingly steady stream of content in between expansions, which is really important to keep people engaged all the way from one expansion to the next.","Battle for Azeroth is our next expansion. And at Blizzard, we're really excited about this expansion. It's coming along great. And it looks like our players are also very excited about it. As Coddy mentioned, our presales are ahead of plan. As always, this expansion features some exciting new features. I'm just going to mention a couple of them that we're particularly excited about. Island Expeditions, where players will explore unchartered islands that include randomly generated elements, we've built AI that will give players a different experience every time they visit an island, and that's to create a highly dynamic experience.","And Warfront, where players will join large groups and get the feeling of being part of a massive battle with different objectives. Warfront is a throwback to Warcraft real-time strategy roots, and we think that players, veterans and new players will really enjoy it. We designed these new features with our players in mind. We think they should get increased engagement as well as more replayable content, so that's really important with a game as massive as World of Warcraft.","This is some really exciting stuff that we're adding. We just entered wider beta testing. Player feedback has been excellent so far. So when the expansion launches in August, we are looking forward to millions more joining us in World of Warcraft.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And it's time for closing remarks. I'd like to turn things over to our CFO, Spencer Neumann.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, I'll make this quick. I have a happy organizational announcement to make and I'll do while we have everybody on the call. So first, I want to congratulate Amrita, our fearless leader in Investor Relations, on a promotion. Amrita is going to become the next CFO of Blizzard, which we're ecstatic about. I hope you guys have all gained an appreciation for Amrita and her skills and capabilities over the years in her three years leading Investor Relations, as the company has been on a tremendous growth curve. We've exceeded performance of all kinds of indices during that three-year period, and we really appreciate all of her efforts along the way. And she's a star in the organization and we're looking forward to the next chapter for her.","And I'm excited to announce, even though we've got very big shoes to fill, that we're thrilled with our new head of Investor Relations that is coming onboard next week. His name is Chris Hickey. Chris is someone who many of you on the phone or on the call may know. He comes from Atlantic Equities, where he's not only an equity analyst, he's a co-founder of the firm, so he's really an entrepreneur at heart as well, and we couldn't be more happy to have him join our team. Chris knows our company well. He knows our industry. He's covered a number of industries across not just gaming, but technology, payments, and services. So he'll be joining officially on May 14.","Amrita, since she's not going far, will ensure a smooth transition as well as Colin and Jason and the team have done a terrific job supporting all of us, especially as Amrita has been transitioning down to Blizzard. So hopefully you all welcome Chris to the team. We're really happy to have him be part of the Activision Blizzard family, and I'm sure you'll get to know a lot more of him in the coming months and years ahead. So thank you.","Operator","And that will conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for joining us. You may now disconnect."],"729":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Amrita Ahuja. Please go ahead.","Amrita Ahuja - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard second quarter 2017 conference call.

And for Q&A, Thomas Tippl, Vice Chairman; Dennis Durkin, Chief Corporate Officer; Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements given in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.","A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors discussed in the risk factor section of our SEC filings, including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC and those indicated on the slide that is showing.

In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Amrita. Q2 was another strong quarter. We exceeded our prior outlook and delivered record first-half revenues. The engagement of our communities remains strong and we believe our momentum can continue through the rest of the year. Our success continues to be the result of our focus on our players and our audiences. Investing in creative and commercial excellence is framed by the three pillars we have shared with you before \u2013 one, expand our reach; two, deepen engagement; and three, provide more opportunity for player investment.","Our teams work tirelessly to deliver the most immersive and engaging experiences for our players. This content provides the connection between hundreds of millions of players around the world. We then enhance these connections with our franchises through initiatives like esports, television and film, and now consumer products. These additional touch points create more value for our shareholders by creating value and engagement for our audiences.","Here are some of the ways we created value for our audiences this quarter. We released new updates across many of our leading franchises this quarter, driving engagement and delivering nearly $0.5 billion of segment operating income, the most we've achieved in a single quarter without new full game releases for any franchise. We also announced the first team sales for the Overwatch League, the first major global city-based professional esports league. We have the very best teams with the very best resources dedicated to celebrating and rewarding the world's best professional Overwatch players.","Overwatch, with more than 30 million players has captured imaginations and driven strong global engagement. We organized our league around major cities, taking a proven model from competition in traditional sports. Our announced team owners and their locations, New England, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai and Seoul and the many more we expect to announce, represent the very best in esports and traditional sports.","We continue to invest in improving our ability to execute and innovate across the company. This quarter, we made some exciting additions to our management team to equip our company with the leadership we need to capitalize on the biggest opportunities we see ahead.","Coddy Johnson rejoined the company as our new President and COO. Coddy proved himself as a transformational leader during the eight years he previously spent with us including as Chief Operating and Financial Officer of Activision Publishing, and we're excited that he rejoined the company for this next growth phase of our business. Later, you'll hear from Spencer Neumann in his new role as CFO, bringing a wealth of experience from a long career at The Walt Disney Company, most recently as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Guest Experience of the Parks and Resorts division. We're also joined by Thomas Tippl, our Vice Chairman; and Dennis Durkin, our Chief Corporate Officer, and all of our business unit heads.","As always, our success is the result of the dedication of our players, fans, employees and partners. We cannot thank enough for their enthusiasm and support.","Coddy will now review the highlights of our operations for this quarter.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Bobby. It's great to be back at Activision Blizzard at such an exciting time of growth and opportunity for the company. As Bobby mentioned, we have incredible communities of players and fans. The joy of our work, what we do each day is to support our teams in building out some of the world's best creative environments and strongest commercial capabilities on behalf of those communities that they can play, connect and engage as deeply as possible. When we get that right, we have the ability to serve our hundreds of millions of audience members with an ongoing stream of content, features, events and products that they love.","The business strategy underlying that work is based on the three pillars you heard from Bobby. We invest in creative and commercial excellence in order to expand reach, deepen engagement and provide more opportunity for player investment which then allows for reinvestment in creative and commercial excellence and for the growth cycle to continue.","We saw this strategy work especially well this quarter with our teams providing more regular content and feature updates across our franchises in our library, leading to our biggest first half of the year in company history, with record revenues driven by digital growth. In Q2, our revenues exceeded our outlook by more than $200 million and earnings per share surpassed our expectations by $0.17.","Given this sizable over-performance and confidence in our plans, we are raising our outlook for the year. Let's start with audience reach, which was 407 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard did not have any new full game releases this quarter, yet a strong stream of content updates across Blizzard franchises drove an all-time MAU record of 46 million, up 38% from last year and up 12% from the last quarter. Blizzard's community has now more than doubled in MAUs since early 2015, underscoring the ability to grow audience reach across the portfolio of platforms, regions, genres and business models.","Notably, the Overwatch community continues to grow its MAUs up each and every quarter since launch and, in Q2, set another all-time MAU record with the release of two seasonal events, and Hearthstone MAUs increased to an all-time record for the franchise, fueled by the new expansion, Journey to Un'Goro.","Activision had 47 million MAUs for the quarter, driven by Call of Duty which continues to have a large and active player base across a number of its titles, many of which received updates during the quarter. In particular, the release of Zombies Chronicles, Activision's first large content drop to a community in year two after a game launch, helped to grow Call of Duty: Black Ops III MAUs quarter-over-quarter.","Activision expects to expand the Call of Duty community this fall with a highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: World War II on November 3. We see great momentum for World War II, not only from key indicators like pre-orders, stated purchase intent and hands-on player feedback, but also from more qualitative measures like video views, social sentiment and engagement which are up year-over-year.","We just debuted Call of Duty: World War II's Zombies mode, which is now our most liked Zombies trailer ever, and we can't wait for players to experience the game during our upcoming beta exclusively on PlayStation 4 on August 25 available for all of those who pre-ordered the game.","Activision along with partner Bungie showcased the upcoming launch of Destiny 2 at multiple events this summer to great enthusiasm. We're excited that Destiny 2's PC version earned E3 Game Critics' PC Game of Show and even more excited that it will be on Blizzard's Battle.net, making it the first non-Blizzard game ever on the platform. Publishing on an owned platform will provide an enhanced player experience, better insights and better economics.","With the PC beta still to come, the Destiny 2 console beta had more players than the first Destiny beta and pre-order levels are now above the first Destiny at this same point in time prelaunch. Destiny 2 full game pre-orders also have the highest digital mix in Activision's history.","Finally, Activision's release of the remastered Crash Bandicoot for PS4 showed the powerful combination of our deep library of beloved IP and our team's ability to create great new content for our communities. The game has outperformed even our most optimistic expectations and with the number one console title globally in June based on units. Notable given it was only available on one platform for two days in the month.","Turning now to our second strategic pillar, engagement, Blizzard's focus on compelling in-game content led to all-time record DAUs and Q2 record play time. In Overwatch, April's Uprising player-versus-environment game mode was well received with record play time. And more recently, the May anniversary event drove strong engagement and record participation in customization items.","Hearthstone's Journey to Un'Goro was one of the best received expansions to-date with record DAUs and World of Warcraft continues to benefit from more regular content updates that Blizzard adds in between major expansions. Time spent in the game is up year-over-year. The Legion expansion continues to outperform the last expansion, and Blizzard plans to release this quarter another large content drop with more details to be revealed at gamescom.","King's MAUs were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Numerous efforts are now underway to grow audience size, but these will take time as the team experiments with reach driving initiatives and continues to develop new creative content for the community. We have, however, seen good success with our live ops and new features, which continue to drive strong engagement. As illustrated by the frequency with which players reengage each month, it remains at an all-time high. To put this in perspective, the time spent per player per day inside King franchises is 35 minutes, higher than that of Instagram or Snapchat.","Our groundbreaking initiative in esports drive engagement and celebrate our players and their achievements in new ways. We made strong progress this quarter on the Overwatch League as Bobby already mentioned. That progress was a meaningful milestone toward establishing a league-based professional competition as a standalone business. We now have a sustainable structure, in which to invest for the long term, with the very best partners from traditional sports and from esports.","Blizzard also recently announced a live-streaming media rights partnership, which showed the value of our broadcast content. Just as importantly though, the partnership carved out a number of future opportunities for mediate rights sales including those related to the Overwatch League. Progress in the Overwatch League also set the stage for Activision's Call of Duty World League. The CWL will wrap up a great season of competition with our upcoming Championship event, and we are well positioned for upcoming season.","Turning now to our third pillar, providing opportunity for player investment; in-game content continues to be a consistent driver for our business, delivering another $1 billion quarter for in-game purchases. King was the biggest contributor with bookings per paying user rising for the eighth quarter in a row to a new record.","Strong engagement and player investment led to an increase in mobile bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. King continued to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 15th quarter in a row and King continued to develop a strong pipeline with both new features across the live games portfolio, multiple new games ahead including a promising publishing partnership with PlayStudios in the social casino segment slated for release later this fall.","King also continues to build out its advertising business which we believe is an important long-term opportunity. We now have new industry-proven leadership in place driving the advertising business. The team is focused on the creation of premium video ad products that can improve player experience, deliver value to advertisers, and create meaningful new revenue streams. Given the growth of the overall mobile advertising ecosystem and the relative brand safety of our network in particular, we think this is a meaningful opportunity for the future.","This quarter, King also entered into a partnership with Facebook Audience Network for its static display ad inventory. The partnership monetizes a portion of King's impressions while the team continues to work toward the long-term video ad opportunity.","Both Activision and Blizzard also had a strong quarter for player investment. Call of Duty's Black Ops Zombies not only drove purchases of that specific piece of content at a recommended $30 price, but also led to higher engagement which in turn led to even more add-on purchases by our players. The strength of our strategy in providing great content wherever our fans engage can be seen in the fact that Call of Duty's in-game purchases were roughly in line with last year's record Q2 performance, all on the strength of great content provided across a number of Call of Duty titles.","Blizzard experienced strong participation with in-game content for Overwatch and Hearthstone and also for Diablo, as the necromancer class, originally debuted in Diablo II, was introduced to Diablo III and embraced by the player community.","Stepping back, the success of our ongoing stream of content, features, events and products to our communities coupled with additional opportunities from our vast library highlights a really strong model both for our fans and their enjoyment and for the company as a high-margin business. We have one of the largest catalogs of owned intellectual properties including game titles that go back to the early 1990s (16:04) and we have hundreds of millions of players in 196 countries, one of the largest digitally connected audiences in the world. This makes it an incredible time to be a part of Activision Blizzard. Our momentum, driven by our inspired team's enabling year-round engagement for our players, drives both near-term performance and future growth opportunities like esports, ads, mobile and consumer products.","Spence will now review the numbers in more detail.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Coddy. I'm thrilled to be here with all of you today and to be part of the Activision Blizzard team. I come here with a deep appreciation for the power of beloved global franchises that build enduring emotional connections with the community. That's the foundation of Activision Blizzard and it's why I believe we have such a bright future.","Today, I'll review our better-than-expected Q2 results, which capped off a record first half. I will also review our outlook for Q3 and our raised outlook for the full year. To review the quarter, I would like to start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been.","Each of our segments contributed to our over-performance this quarter. We outperformed our outlook due to the combined power of our franchise breadth, a steady stream of content serving our uniquely engaged community and our talented teams. At the aggregate level, we delivered combined segment operating income of $476 million which, as Bobby indicated, represents a record for a quarter without a new full game franchise release.","Activision generated operating income of $87 million, roughly flat year-over-year with strong Call of Duty performance across the overall franchise, offsetting expected lower performance on Infinite Warfare. Our strategy of providing content wherever our players engage drove this upside, as did improved performance across Activision's catalog, including a very positive reception to Crash Bandicoot.","Blizzard's $225 million of operating income was the largest segment earnings contributor in the quarter, led by the strength of the Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone franchises. Operating income was down year-over-year as expected given the comp to last year's significant Q2 Overwatch release.","And King delivered $164 million of operating income in the quarter, which was slightly down year-over-year, but relatively flat sequentially. Continued growth in per-player engagement and player investment led to stable year-over-year revenues with Candy Crush franchise.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you'd like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.63 billion, $206 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $213 million for the quarter. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 in Q2, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.12. The over-performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven largely by business over-performance as well as some expense timing.","From a capital structure perspective, we continued our positive rating agency momentum and received another upgrade from S&P to BBB. We also entered into a leverage-neutral $1.2 billion refinancing that locked in attractive long-term interest rates, bringing our blended cost of debt to 3.6% and provided a better staggering of debt maturities.","We delivered Q2 operating cash flow of $265 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, about one-third of which is held domestically and approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of approximately $1.2 billion at quarter-end.","Lastly, we paid a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, which was up 15% year-over-year for a total $226 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2017.","Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q3. Our Q3 slate continues our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community, including Blizzard's Hearthstone expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne, additional maps for Activision's Infinite Warfare, and new features and live ops across King titles.","In addition, Blizzard is launching a remastered version of the original StarCraft on August 14. This will offer new and veteran players the same classic StarCraft game play with 4K graphics, modern conveniences like cloud saves, and connectivity to Blizzard's updated Battle.net ecosystem for an enhanced social and competitive experience. And of course, Activision has two major releases in the back half of the year. We'll launch Destiny 2 on console on September 6 with the PC launch to follow on October 24. We'll also continue the marketing ramp for the November 3 release of Call of Duty: World War II.","For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.385 billion including GAAP deferrals of $315 million, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a tax rate of 30%, GAAP and non-GAAP share counts of 766 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.09.","For Q3 on a non-GAAP, as redefined, basis, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 49%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $40 million, a tax rate of 25%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 including a GAAP deferral of $0.11. And just to remind everyone if you'd like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you'd start with our non-GAAP, as redefined, EPS guidance of $0.34 and add the impact of deferrals for $0.11.","Before I turn to our 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide some detail on the impact of the Overwatch League. With the recently-announced sale of seven teams, we do expect some revenue upside to Q4, but it will be modest given the recognition of team sale proceeds over multiple years. Further, from an operating income perspective, the revenue recognition of team sales will be partially offset by the investment required to launch the league including inaugural season marketing.","As we look ahead to the first season, we see a number of important upcoming milestones, including standing up league operations, supporting team's development of player rosters, attracting sponsors, elevating the viewer experience and securing media distribution. We're investing in this league for the long term. Over time, we expect to recognize additional revenues related to both more team sales and multiple league revenue streams. We see this as a substantial long-term value driver for the business.","Now, turning to our raised 2017 full-year outlook, which passes through business over-performance from Q2 and now includes the Overwatch League's modest revenue contribution and roughly breakeven EPS contribution. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion including GAAP deferrals of $175 million, product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 16%.","We expect 767 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined. And GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.05. For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.94, including a GAAP deferral of $0.06. And if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we use to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP, as redefined, EPS guidance of $1.94, you add the impact of deferrals or $0.06.","In closing, I just want to echo Bobby and Coddy's sentiment. This is such an exciting time in Activision Blizzard. By delivering engaging content, features and services to our community, including in-game content and remastered IP from our unparalleled library, we can increasingly generate digital, recurring, high-margin revenue opportunities.","Our core games business has never been stronger, and it's also powering future growth vectors like esports, advertising, consumer products, TV and film, and mobile. We believe we have tremendous opportunities ahead of us and, as always, we remain focused on rigorous prioritization, operational excellence, fiscal discipline and long-term shareholder value.","Now I welcome our business leaders Eric, Mike, Ricardo, Dennis and Thomas as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And we'll take our first question from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and congratulations on another strong quarter. Now that you've announced the first group of team sales for the Overwatch League, I was hoping you could expand on the longer term opportunities and perhaps more specifically a timeframe around some of the key milestones that we should be looking for in the coming quarters. Thank you.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","I'll take that, Colin. Look, there is great momentum that we're seeing in the league. And when you think about what we have planned in terms of the next round of team announcements, that will continue the momentum. That, to me, was the biggest milestone, was getting that great blend of endemic teams of professional sports owners. And if you think about whether it's in tech or in esports or in professional sports, we're assembling the very best owners for all of these sports.","We've announced the first seven and I think what you're going to see is that probably the most important milestones are, as we get towards the latter part of the year and we start to kick off competition, when you see what we're doing in terms of the broadcast rights and sponsorship opportunities, but from every perspective, I think we think we've organized the league in the best way that will allow us to celebrate our players and our fans.","And if you think about over 30 million players today, this is a very large audience. Even if your spectators were only coming from your player population, that is a very, very large audience to be able to have advertisers and sponsors and partners for it. So I'd say we're off to a really great start. And you'll hear more about future team sales over the balance of the year, but we couldn't be happy with the progress that we've made so far and it's really exciting.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about early learnings from the Destiny 2 beta? How are you feeling as far as pre-orders at this point, particularly for the package that includes first year DLC? Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Mike. It's Eric. I'll take that. So the beta went great and there is a lot of excitement about Destiny 2 overall and a lot of positive signs pretty much anywhere you look. First of all, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in the game at its closing. We think it's going to be a great game. And we received almost universally positive feedback from both the press and the fans after people got their hands on the beta. And I think it's also worth noting that Destiny won 45 awards at E3 and we think it's continuing to close strong.","We also have very strong pre-orders. And Coddy mentioned this broadly, but the specifics are the number one position on Nielsen's unaided awareness and next choice purchase intent. And while no one of those data points is ever predictive in a vacuum, we found that when you have all three of those trending positively, it's usually a very good thing.","And then there are also several firsts at Destiny 2, the way we're going to market that are designed to bring the franchise to a broader audience starting with the fact that we've got a great PC game. Of those 45 awards, one of them is the official Best of Show for PC at E3. We've actually added a number of languages and localizations to make the game more appealing and accessible to more audiences around the world. And of course, I think our watershed partnership with Blizzard is going to bring Destiny to the most passionate PC fans anywhere in the world, so puts it on the best possible stage.","And finally, maybe most importantly with a game like this, Destiny is so engaging that the follow-on content is almost as important if not as important at the main game. And as I mentioned on earlier calls, we've completely changed our approach to tapping that by widening our stable of AAA developers so that we can keep up with the demand, it's a high class problem, but we haven't been able to do that in the past, keep up the demand for more content.","And I think that fans agree with the importance of that, which is evidenced by the fact that such an overwhelmingly high percentage of the pre-orders thus far are from one of our elevated SKUs which include the Season Pass and the follow-on content. So, lots of good signs. The beta being just one of them and we're really excited and have confidence we have a great game.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Hi. Congratulations on the quarter and thank you for taking my question. So how do you think about audience reach on the King network versus engagement and how do you grow it? Thanks.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Tim. It's Riccardo here. So when we think about our network, we think primarily about audience reach and audience engagement. And we're focused on increasing both. In the live games, we have been primarily focused on increasing the audience engagement and we have done this through fresh content, new features and live operations. And we have seen great results, with impact reflected in the high DAU and MAU ratio as well as in the retention of the most engaged players. And this has resulted in an increase \u2013 in a continued increase of our player monetization. Candy Crush, which is a title which is now five years old, has recently hit again the number one grossing in the U.S. App Store charts. And we also see great results in our other live games.","In regards to audience reach, we think we have more work to do and this will take some more time. But we are very focused on it. The audience reach we know that we can, let's say, impact the audience reach with new titles. Here, we have our teams focused on developing multiple new titles for the long term, in particular focusing strategically first of all on our casual genre for our existing audience. But we're also looking at extending into new genres, in particular at mid core. Here we have of course big opportunities within the company, the wider company and we are exploring mobile opportunities for some of the company's existing powerhouse franchises, like the partnership we have announced recently with Activision Publishing for Call of Duty.","In the near term, we're also working on a social casino title in partnership with PlayStudios and we expect to release this title by the end of the year. In regards to audience reach, we also believe that there are opportunities to stabilize and grow the audience reach in the live games. The team so far has been focused on engagement and monetization features, and they will continue to focus on engagement and monetization features where we've been successful, but we will also start focusing more on features that can impact reach as well.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.","Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company","Thanks. Could you maybe talk a little more about the structure of the Overwatch economics? How you're sharing revenue with the team owners? So, what were some of the key points that encouraged your partners that they could make money off this over the long term? Thanks.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Doug. This is Spence. I'll take a shot at this one. So we were really deliberate in structuring this business to attract the best owners and players in order to position the Overwatch League for long-term success. And that starts with optimizing alignment between the league which we own with the teams and our players. So at the league level, we're establishing a pool of shared league-wide revenues composed of media rights and consumer products, league-level sponsorship and a portion of league-related digital in-game merchandise.","And then we'll net those league costs like marketing and production and league operations against those revenue streams and share the resulting amount 50-50 between the league and the teams. And then at the team level, we've got these fantastic entrepreneurial owners, and we wanted to be sure we developed the structure that enabled those owners to not only fund player and team operations, but also create real incremental value at the local level.","So in addition to their league participation, the teams have their own local revenue streams including the more traditional areas like ticket sales and concessions and local sponsorships and local merch sales. But they'll also have more unique opportunities such as the ability to host certain nonprofessional Overwatch matches.","And so \u2013 and then lastly when we think about the players, we established minimum salaries, benefits and bonuses for players so that we're providing a security and stability required to attract the best talent on the planet. So I guess if we step back, we position the league and the team owners to invest alongside one another to build value at both the league and the local level, leveraging the capabilities and infrastructure that we each bring to bear for the benefit of our players and our fans. So we've got plenty of work to do here and we're getting ready for the launch later this year and we look forward to sharing more progress soon.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Thornton with SunTrust.","Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. The Activision segment was really strong this go around. Maybe can you talk a little bit about Call of Duty, how that's tracking, and in particular as we think about World War II in 4Q, maybe just how we're tracking relative to prior releases? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Matt. So the trends are really good in World War II, and I'll talk about those, but I think it's also perhaps first important to step back and look at the Call of Duty franchise overall, which remains incredibly strong. We had strong MAUs this quarter with audiences at a relevant scale across multiple titles. And importantly, despite the headwinds that we talk about on IW, both MAUs and OI are both in line with our record Q2 performance from last year despite those headwinds. So our strategy of bringing content and adding content wherever our players choose to play is really paying off, and I think that's what drove the positive performance you referenced in the quarter.","We had that for Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered. We continue to season the content that was scheduled for those, we also brought the Zombies Chronicles which Coddy mentioned, which was remastered, some of our most beloved content from the Black Ops Zombies canon, and that also speaks to the strength of that catalog and our ability to continue to delight fans with new versions of that. So it really does speak to the size and strength and stability of Call of Duty that we can do this across multiple titles and I can't think of another franchise that can.","On World War II specifically, probably most importantly, we think we have the right game at the right time. And I can tell you that those who have played it, the return to boots on the ground, the return to human scale, authentic military content and context for the franchise is a welcome change and very well timed. And everything that fans have touched by the way is a lot more than unusual. We had multiplayer hands-on at E3 for only the second time in our history this year.","Everything that consumers have put their hands on, we've gotten really positive response from fans as well as from critics. And there's a couple of data points which show that. First of all, the reveal trailer was the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and we've got a pretty great history with that. And we had the most organic views of any CoD reveal trailer ever.","The hands-on multiplayer at E3 was well received and the Zombies trailer that we revealed at Comic-Con went on to become our most liked Zombies trailer ever with an overwhelmingly positive sentiment as well. So the good news is you don't have to take my word for any of this. Our beta starts on August 25 on PlayStation and I hope all of you are going to join us and play.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. You talked a little bit about King advertising in your prepared remarks and I wonder if you would just give us an update on how the rollout of King ads is going.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Evan. It's Riccardo again. Sure. So we are continuing to work to build out this new business, and our first priority is to build a very strong team. As you heard earlier, we made significant progress recently, adding a great new leader to drive this business forward. And in terms of update on the business itself, we put the player experience first.","So our focus is, first of all, on creating a really compelling ad format. And we define this as an ad format which is well integrated into the game play and that provides value for the player as well as value for the advertiser. And currently, we are evaluating the results of these first ad format tests, and we are continuing the work on creating more premium video ad products.","We're also widening the variety of ad formats beyond video. As you heard before, we had signed a partnership with Facebook to offer their image ad product, and so we are introducing image ads, and this format will allow us to monetize our global audience. So, overall, we feel very excited about this opportunity. We think it's a very substantial opportunity given the size and the engagement of our network. And so I will give you an update at a later date on further progress.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk at a high level how Blizzard is allocating its time and resources right now? What percent of man-hours are spent on new IP versus existing IP? And I guess I'd be curious to hear you talk about how you think about Blizzard's new IP pipeline the next three to five years. Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Brian. Thanks. This is Mike. First and foremost, I'd just say that the bulk of our focus continues to be supporting our existing players and releasing high-quality content for our existing games. This quarter is a great example of that approach. We delivered a consistent flow of updates and new content across all of our games, and that has driven record engagement even without a new game launch. We're also really excited about the future. In addition to supporting all of our live games, we're committed to incubating new initiatives and we're also thinking about different platforms, especially mobile.","In terms of new IP, our pipeline is in a better position than ever before in our history. Last year, Allen Adham, who cofounded Blizzard with me and Frank Pearce, returned to the company to take on the task of coordinating our efforts in this regard. And this includes some great ideas that we'd already started to explore. So we now have multiple dedicated incubation teams that are being led by some of our most experienced game designers at Blizzard.","I should say that creating new Blizzard-quality games on any platform will take time. And as we've shown in the past, we're not going to release any games that we don't feel live up to our expectations or those of our players. When we do bring new experiences to current or new platforms for new and existing IPs, there're going to be ideas that our teams are passionate about and that we think there's a large audience for.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the call, and congrats on the success of Crash. I'm wondering what do you see as the long-term opportunity in remastered nostalgic titles. And do you see opportunities within your own portfolio of owned IP? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Ray. It's Eric. So first, we knew that there was a passionate audience out there for Crash. Full disclosure myself among them, but we had no idea \u2013 it's hard to tell whether that's a vocal minority or whether that's a real mass audience until you put something out there. And Crash has surpassed all of our expectations by a pretty wide margin. And a couple of stats that underscore that point where it was the number one selling console game in June based on units, even though it was only available for two days during that month. And Sony reported this morning, well timed, I guess for this call, that Crash is the most downloaded game on the PlayStation store in July.","So as to your broader question, I think this is just another example of us really listening to our communities and our fans and offering them great content where they want to engage which is one of our core strategies. So we think we have other great IP in our portfolio that we're considering of course, but we've already \u2013 this isn't new behavior for us. We've already shown the power of this with Modern Warfare Remastered last year with Zombies Chronicles that we talked about. Obviously, Crash Bandicoot is another great example.","So this is a strategy that clearly has our attention, and while there are no new announcements today, I think you can be confident that there will be more activity like this in the future with more great IP. The other opportunity beyond remastered is to look at some of our classic IP and ask whether or not it could be reborn on a new platform like what we're going with Skylanders on mobile. So I think that our IP library is an asset that, when done right, can be very powerful.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","I'll jump in just for a second. Ray, it's Coddy. Echo Eric's points, but even more broadly across the company, in looking ahead, Spence already shared the Blizzard plans to release a remastered version of StarCraft in Q3. We wind up additional releases of that kind of beloved fan favorite content going forward. Eric said, no announcements today, but there's just a beloved IP out there that our communities love to engage in, and it's worth a further step back, which is we are really in a transition \u2013 a tailwind, strong transition to game to the service model where we have these passionate and deeply engaged, digitally connected communities to which we can provide an ongoing stream of services, features, events, content. And it is a really strong model, both for our fans and our players and their communities, and a chance to really connect online with each other, but also for the company as a business.","And you can expect us to continue to pursue this, to look for additional ways to engage our digitally connected audiences, hundreds of millions of fans and players both on our large franchises which we're doing and Eric mentioned as well as in our most popular nostalgic intellectual properties and also new opportunities. And that's powerful combination between the digitally connected audience that very few engage and our ability to have inspired teams deliver content to them is it's a strong model and I think we're still in the early days of exploring it. And I think you'll see us continue to pursue that in the calls to come.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","I think that wraps. Thanks, everyone, for your time today. We'll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today's call over to Ms. Kristin Southey. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's Fourth Quarter 2011 Conference Call. With me today are Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Thomas Tippl, COO and CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; and Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. As indicated in the slide that is showing, a number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, without limitation, sales levels; increasing concentration of titles; shifts in consumer spending trends; current macroeconomic and industry conditions and conditions within the video game industry; our ability to predict consumer preferences among competing genres and hardware platforms; the seasonal and cyclical nature of our industry; changing business models, including digital delivery of content; competition, including from used games; possible declines in pricing; product returns; price protection; product delays; adoption rate and availability of new hardware and related software; rapid changes in technology and industry standards; litigation and associated costs; protection of proprietary rights; maintenance of key relationships, including the ability to attract, retain and develop key personnel and developers that can create high-quality hit titles; counterparty risk; economic, financial and political conditions and policies; foreign exchange and tax rates; and identification of acquisition opportunities; and potential challenges associated with geographic expansion.","These important factors and other factors that potentially could affect the company's financial results are described in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2010, and in the company's other SEC filings. The company may change its intentions, beliefs or expectations made at any time and without notice, based upon any changes in such factors, in the company's assumptions or otherwise. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, February 9, 2012, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.","I'd also like to note that certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; expenses related to share-based compensation; expenses related to the restructuring; the amortization of intangibles, and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill; and the associated tax benefit. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted at www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanations.","There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast, and which will be posted on the website following the call. In addition, we will also post a 12-quarter financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and along with a summary sheet.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and thank you all for joining us today. 2011 was another record year for Activision Blizzard. In 2011, we generated nearly $1 billion in operating cash flow. And over the last 3 years, we've generated over $3.5 billion in operating cash flow, and we've returned more than $3 billion in value to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.","In the U.S. and Europe, we remain the largest and most profitable third-party interactive entertainment company and the largest and most profitable third-party interactive entertainment digital publisher. We again delivered better-than-expected financial results and achieved multiple financial and operational records, as we have for the last few years. We achieved record operating margins and record EPS, which grew more than 17% over the prior year, and as I mentioned, we generated nearly $1 billion in operating cash flow, which allows us to continue to invest thoughtfully in our future growth and return capital to our shareholders.","With that in mind, we're increasing our dividend 9% to $0.18 per share, and our Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. Our strong performance is a testament to the hard work and incredible talent of all of the Activision Blizzard employees around the world. Their commitment to excellence, teamwork and inspired creativity continues to drive our superior performance.","Today, we're going to highlight a few important achievements from 2011 and provide some greater detail about our plans for 2012 and beyond, including our strong lineup, our expansion into new markets and new business models, and our development initiatives for new platforms.","2011 was a very competitive year. There were many great products released, and gamers had more entertainment choices on more platforms than ever before. Despite these choices and new competitors, Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft remains far and away the world's largest online subscription-based massively multiplayer game, ending the year with 10.2 million subscribers. World of Warcraft has a very loyal group of players and later in the call, Mike Morhaime will share some of this year's plans for the franchise.","Perhaps the greatest challenge we always face in our business is the launch of large, sustainable, inspired, new franchises. Skylanders is one of the most innovative products we've ever created, and its success could continue for many years to come.","Two days ago, we announced our next iteration, Skylanders Giants, and the success we've had with Skylanders demonstrates this unique ability we have as a company to create franchises with enduring value. It is equally difficult to make certain that a franchise delivers groundbreaking innovation, compelling new gameplay and the special sauce that engages new and existing audiences.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 quickly became the biggest entertainment launch of all time, and the best-selling game ever in a single year, beating the record previously set by Call of Duty: Black Ops. And Call of Duty Elite, the first service of its kind, has redefined social gameplay. It has become one of the fastest-growing online services in history with over 7 million registered users, including more than 1.5 million premium members who have activated an annual subscription. Call of Duty Elite now ranks behind World of Warcraft and Xbox LIVE as one of the largest interactive entertainment premium services.","2011 also marked the eighth consecutive year of revenue growth for the Call of Duty franchise. Its expansion was driven not only by strong retail performance and online engagement of Modern Warfare 3, but also by strong retail sales and record downloadable content sales for multiple past titles, as well as our continued laser focus on developing new vectors for growth and player engagement. Today, Call of Duty is one of the largest entertainment brands in the world and on a stand-alone basis, represents a large global business with multiple product lines and strong prospects for future growth and audience expansion.","Our ability to innovate has yielded products that are deeper and more interactive. And as a result, video games today are perceived as more viable and faster-growing entertainment media than passive media like film and television. By evolving our offerings, we have pioneered the platforms and technologies that constitute the next generation of the entertainment industry. Deep investment in and development of our properties has created category-defining franchises that are setting a new standard for audience engagement across all forms of entertainment. And our ability to combine innovation with sound business strategies and operational excellence is the core strength of Activision Blizzard. Our broad product portfolio, which includes some of the largest entertainment franchises in the world; our large and continually growing online communities; our global reach and our unmatched financial strength, truly set us apart and provide us with a competitive advantage.","Activision Blizzard's sustained success over 20 years amidst a rapidly changing industry is the result of 3 long-term guiding principles. First, focus on the largest opportunities that we believe will deliver the highest financial returns; secondly, attract and retain the best creative and technical talent through a performance-based reward system; and then be good stewards of the capital generated by our successful investments by not overpaying for acquisitions in the interest of buying growth at any cost, by not overspending and working hard to keep costs aligned against sensible business opportunities, which is where most companies falter.","This approach, which appears simple but is challenging to execute, has enabled us to deliver solid results for the past 20 years. And our approach in 2012 will be no different, as we will focus our pipeline on online-enabled products. This year in particular, Blizzard Entertainment plans to release multiple anticipated titles, including Diablo III. And from Activision Publishing, we plan to have a new Call Of Duty game and expect to grow Call of Duty Elite. We also plan to launch a new Skylanders game in the Skylanders universe, Skylanders Giants, and we'll continue to invest in new products, business models and initiatives, including our new universe from Bungie.","Today, our online platforms including Battle.net and Call of Duty Elite support approximately 50 million monthly active users, many of whom we can communicate with and deliver content and innovative game experiences to. Over the next few years, this direct relationship should allow us to create deeper customer player experiences and further expand our large player community.","For each of the past 3 years, Activision Blizzard has delivered operating margin expansion and EPS growth and in total, generated over $3.5 billion in operating cash flow. Our consistent financial and operational performance is the result of our collaborative corporate culture, which attracts the industry's most talented, creative and capable people, and our laser focus on our long term objectives. It's our commitment to excellence and the hard work of our incredibly talented employees around the world that has allowed us to remain the leader in interactive entertainment.","In addition, our strong balance sheet and financial discipline allow us to continue to invest to deliver innovative entertainment experiences, capitalize on growth opportunities afforded by new technologies, and expand our global reach, all of which should allow us to increase shareholder value in the future, as we have over the last 20 years.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Thomas Tippl who will take you through our financial results.","Thomas Tippl","Thank you, Bobby. Today, I'll begin with a recap of our record December quarter and calendar year results, followed by a review of our outlook for 2012. Please refer to our earnings release for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. Also, the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted.","For the calendar year, on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.8 billion, record operating margin of 28% and record EPS of $0.92. On a non-GAAP basis, for the calendar year, we generated significantly better-than-expected revenues of nearly $4.5 billion. We expanded our non-GAAP operating margin 170 basis points to a record 30.3%, and we grew EPS 18% to a record $0.93.","Despite challenging retail conditions, tough comps for Call of Duty and no frontline releases from Blizzard, we set new record results for the industry and exceeded our going-in expectations for 2011 by a wide margin.","Since our merger with Blizzard in 2008, our operating margins have increased by more than 625 basis points and reflect profitability well exceeding other interactive entertainment companies, most major media companies and several leaders in Internet and software. Additionally, since the merger, we have grown EPS double digits every year, and this year marks our largest increase yet. Finally and most importantly, this year, we generated nearly $1 billion in operating cash flow, which enables us to invest in our growth opportunities and return significant value to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.","Over the last 3 years alone, we have invested over $3 billion in product development and sales and marketing, generated $3.5 billion in operating cash flow, and returned $3.1 billion in value to shareholders. All of these financial milestones further demonstrate that the opportunities in interactive entertainment far outweigh the challenges for us, and that we continue to focus our investments appropriately against the largest opportunities.","Now moving to the details of our fourth quarter results. On a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $0.08. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $2.4 billion and increased earnings per share by 17% to a new quarterly record of $0.62. Our strong performance for the quarter and year-to-date has been driven by our products with breakthrough innovation, online integration and digital revenue streams, including Blizzard's World of Warcraft, Activision's Call of Duty, and our newest IP, Skylanders.","In 2011, our products with online integration and digital revenue streams also drove record digital revenues of approximately $1.6 billion, and this was accomplished despite the lack of frontline releases from Blizzard.","Turning to the specific P&L line items for the fourth quarter. Please note, all percentages are based on revenues, except the tax rate. For GAAP, product costs were 38% and operating expenses were 60%. Our GAAP tax rate was negative due to strong profit performance abroad where corporate tax rates are lower and tax reserves rolling off after the statute of limitations expired.","For the quarter, non-GAAP product costs were 31%. This is up from our prior outlook due to the over-performance of our distribution business. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 32%, lower than our prior outlook, due mainly to leverage from strong top line performance, including over-performance of Skylanders toys. Investment income was negative as a result of FX hedges for the fourth quarter. Finally, our tax rate came in at 18%, which is lower than expected for the same reasons I mentioned a minute ago.","Now turning to the balance sheet. On December 31, we had no debt and a record $3.54 billion, or nearly $3 per share, in cash and investments. This is despite significant investment in the most robust pipeline of new products and services we have ever had and returning about $875 million in value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in 2011.","The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our cash flows are major competitive advantages that afford us the ability to first, invest for future growth in opportunities with the highest organic return on invested capital like this year's successful launches of Skylanders and Call of Duty Elite, which established 2 new vectors for long-term growth; second, invest for future growth through the allocation of capital to attractive external opportunities, for example, with our 10-year exclusive agreement with Bungie; and finally, return value in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And today, we were pleased to announce that the board authorized a new $1 billion repurchase program to begin in April and increased the cash dividend by 9% to $0.18 per share.","So let me now move on to the outlook for 2012. As we've done historically, we begin the year with a reasonably conservative approach, due in part to the continued uncertainties in the broader macroeconomic environment and volatility in foreign exchange markets. We entered the year with financial strength, strong market fundamentals for digital and an expanding portfolio of category-leading franchises and unique online service capabilities that offer expansion opportunities for the long term. Accordingly, we are focused on strengthening operations at retail, expanding our digital footprint and adding innovation and new business models to each of our properties to continue driving growth.","Specifically, this year, we expect growth from Blizzard. In addition to World of Warcraft, which provides a strong foundation, Blizzard plans to launch at least 2 titles this year, including Diablo III with its real money auction house. Business pipeline has never been stronger, including World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria, StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, the Blizzard DOTA and the next-generation MMO.","Second, Activision Publishing will be laser-focused on raising the bar with this year's new Call of Duty, growing Call of Duty Elite and expanding the Skylanders franchise. The Skylanders franchise is well positioned for growth this year, driven by the continued sales of Skylanders and its new launch of Skylanders Giants. We will also continue to invest in the development of Call of Duty for China, as well as the Bungie universe, which is expected to be one of Publishing's next big things.","Third, we plan to continue our track record of operating margin expansion. In 2012, margin expansion should be fueled by an increasing mix of higher-margin revenues, strong performance from above-average margin in Skylanders toys, and the high-margin Blizzard product slate. In addition, we continue to undertake productivity improvement initiatives across key areas of operating expenses. This should allow us to expand our non-GAAP margins to a new record while continuing to invest in our future product pipeline and online capabilities. So now on to the numbers.","For calendar year 2012, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $4.15 billion, product cost of 29% and operating expenses of 48%. We expect a tax rate of 26% for the year and have assumed a share count of about 1.15 billion, resulting in EPS of $0.63. Our GAAP results are expected to be down versus the prior year due to significantly larger deferrals from 2012 into 2013, driven by Blizzard's slate and growth of Call of Duty Elite.","For 2012, we expect non-GAAP net revenues of $4.5 billion. At our Analyst Day in September, we projected 5%-plus average annual revenue growth through 2014 off a base of $4.05 billion. Our outlook today represents an 11% revenue increase versus that baseline and again, already in the first year, puts us way ahead of our long-term growth plan.","This year, we expect non-GAAP revenue growth from Blizzard, driven by the release of 2 new titles and from the core Activision Publishing business, offset by a reduction of approximately $130 million in revenues from our distribution and affiliate businesses. In addition, we factored in about $200 million of negative FX year-over-year to protect against potentially adverse volatility in the currency markets. On a constant currency basis, our initial outlook calls for 5% revenue growth. We expect non-GAAP product cost of 27% and operating expenses of about 40%. This should result in year-over-year non-GAAP operating income growth of 8%, and on a constant currency basis, growth of 15%.","For calendar 2012, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.94. Again, at our Analyst Day, we projected 10%-plus average annual earnings growth for 2014 with a starting point of $0.77. And our outlook today already represents a 22% increase in EPS. That puts us significantly ahead of our growth targets despite reasonably conservative assumptions going into the year.","The 2012 non-GAAP EPS outlook of $0.94 is only slightly ahead of prior year actuals due to a higher tax rate versus a year ago. On the other hand, we now expect that the 27% tax rate for 2012 is also a good planning assumption for our long-term tax rate versus our previous long-term tax rate assumption of 30%. This lower average long-term tax rate is a result of stronger international profit performance. And applying our current multiple, this amounts to more than $0.5 billion of additional value creation for our shareholders.","Over the last 3 years, we've outperformed our going-in GAAP EPS outlook. And people always ask, where could there be upside to our numbers? We think there are big 5 areas. Number one, if Blizzard releases more than 2 titles this year; two, if the Call of Duty franchise continues its track record of growth; three, if Call of Duty Elite comes in better than expected; four, if Skylanders' toy momentum continues and Giants is a top 10 title for the year; and five, if FX rates stay where they are currently. Now keep in mind, there's also risk associated with each of these items, as well as other risks highlighted in our Safe Harbor statement and 10-K.","So moving on to the March quarter outlook. This quarter, we do not have any major frontline releases, but we will release our first \u00e0 la carte map pack for Modern Warfare 3 on Xbox. So for the March quarter, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $965 million, with product costs of 30% and operating expenses of 34%. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $0.22.","For the March quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $525 million. Revenues are expected to be down versus the prior year, due in part to differences in launch timing of the \u00e0 la carte Modern Warfare 3 DLC. This quarter, the \u00e0 la carte DLC pack will not hit until late in the quarter and only on Xbox. Last year, the first map pack launched early in the quarter and on both platforms. There will also be some impact due to Call of Duty Elite as revenues are recognized ratably over the 12-month subscription, starting with activation.","Blizzard revenues are also expected to be down in the quarter due to tough comps, as last year they benefited from a higher subscriber base and the strong holiday launch of Cataclysm. We expect non-GAAP product costs of 34% and operating expenses of 57%.","Operating expenses are expected to be higher than the prior year due to lower revenues and increased investments, especially in sales and marketing for Blizzard's upcoming release of Diablo III and Activision Publishing's Call of Duty Elite. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.03. So in summary, 2011 was another year of strong financial and operational performance. And we think that our strength in the retail and digital segments, combined with our ability to create new revenue streams through continued disciplined capital investments and ongoing cost-containment efforts, position us in 2012 for yet another record year.","So now let me hand it over to Eric to discuss our Activision Publishing business.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Thomas, and hello, everyone. 2011 was an incredible year for Activision Publishing. I'm proud to say that, especially given that last year, at this time, many doubted whether we could deliver the best-selling game of the year, launch a new online digital service and launch a new intellectual property, creating a new multi-platform franchise in the process. So I'm happy to say that we not only achieved all of these goals but exceeded them and ended the year stronger and more profitable than ever.","These achievements would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone at Activision Publishing worldwide, and I want to thank them for their efforts. Without their focus, drive and creativity, we could not have had the largest entertainment launch in history for the third consecutive year, delivering the highest grossing game ever in a single year with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3; nor could we have launched a new intellectual property that will become the #1 kids video game of the year in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure; nor could we have launched one of the fastest-growing premium subscription services ever with Call of Duty Elite. Each of these accomplishments was unprecedented and enabled us to deliver record operating margins and significant income growth. But more importantly, we created 2 new revenue streams for the company in one year that have the potential to be large and accretive in the future.","So before I go into detail about our upcoming slate, I would like to quickly recap the broader market trends, which direct where we focus our time, energy and resources. First, in 2011, the hardware installed base continued to grow to record levels, especially for HD consoles. And in 2012, we expect the installed base of current-gen systems in North America and Europe will increase 14% to 355 million units, the highest ever. Within that, we expect that the installed base of the online-enabled consoles, the 360 and PS3, specifically, will increase 18% to 112 million, and this doesn't include the expected launch of the Wii U.","Second, we continue to see strong growth in digital channels. In 2011, digital revenues grew double digits, and we saw increased consumer acceptance of new business models like subscriptions, in-game transactions and downloadable content. And in 2012, we expect worldwide growth for retail and digital, combined with digital expected to grow double digits again in the U.S. and Europe.","Overall, today's positive market fundamentals create even greater global opportunities for the best franchises, especially high-margin, online-enabled franchise, which aligns squarely with our portfolio and our strategies. Our objective is to continue building our strong and growing global player communities. This year, we are focused on 5 areas that we expect will drive growth over the next few years which include further expanding the Call of Duty franchise; enhancing and growing Call of Duty Elite, building on the momentum of Skylanders; investing and laying the foundation for the launch of the new Bungie universe; and investing in new opportunities like IP, tech, emerging platforms and new business models.","With respect to Call of Duty, make no mistake, we will continue to invest heavily in the expansion of the franchise, which once again demonstrated its incredible reach and engagement this year. Today, Call of Duty is one of the largest entertainment franchises ever, and we have grown the brand every year for the past 8 years. And this year was no different.","What is different, and unlike many other franchises in interactive entertainment today, is that the franchise has many verticals that contribute and continue to show incredible staying power. In 2011, previous and current Call of Duty releases continued to rank at the top of the global sales charts, continued to rank at the top of global engagement charts and continued to set new records in downloadable content sales.","In 2011, Modern Warfare 3 was the best-selling game in the U.S. and Europe. Black Ops was the #5 best-selling game, and Modern Warfare 2 and World at War still continued to sell in the millions. And by any measure, Call of Duty engagement has never been stronger. In 2011, the franchise is estimated to have had over 40 million monthly active users across 5 Call of Duty titles. In terms of MAUs in December alone, Modern Warfare 3 exceeded 20 million; Black Ops exceeded 10 million; Modern Warfare 2 exceeded 5 million; and World at War and Modern Warfare, which launched 3 and 4 years ago, respectively, had more than 2.5 million monthly active users combined.","Also, during 2011, Modern Warfare 3 was the most played game on Xbox LIVE, and the year-old Black Ops was the second most played game on Xbox LIVE. And the 2-year old Modern Warfare 2 was the third most played game on Xbox LIVE. And in 2011, sales of downloadable content for the franchise set new industry records, with growth exceeding the estimated growth rates of the social and mobile segments combined. On a cumulative basis, 2011 sales of DLC for Black Ops, Modern Warfare 2 and World at War were equivalent to a top 5 console title. Bottom line, the Call of Duty portfolio has never been larger or more diverse as it is comprised of a number of incredible games, additional content releases and online services that have created a very large and engaged online community.","And this year, we expect to further expand our presence with the launch of an all-new, epic first person shooter title under the Call of Duty brand. From what we've seen to date, the game already looks fantastic and will bring meaningful innovation to the franchise. I could not be more excited and truly look forward to sharing details with you in the future.","And we plan to keep our foot on the gas with Call of Duty Elite, which was specifically designed for the large and engaged Call of Duty online community and is already one of the fastest-growing and largest online services ever. Call of Duty Elite, which only launched last quarter, already has more than 7 million registered members and within that, more than 1.5 million players have already activated a premium annual membership, establishing Call of Duty Elite as the third largest interactive subscription service behind only World of Warcraft and Xbox LIVE, both of which, as you know, have been around for many years.","And although we are pleased with where we are today, the undisputable objective of Call of Duty Elite is to make the total Call of Duty experience more fun and more engaging, and we plan to launch additional features in the next 60 days.","In 2012, we will continue to offer stand-alone DLC for Modern Warfare 3; however, Elite premium subscribers will receive 9 consecutive months of content. This new model provides tremendous value to Elite premium members by offering more content more often and with more variety than ever before. And for players who already planned on buying all of the DLC, Call of Duty Elite costs less than buying all the downloadable content packs, essentially more than paying for itself.","Finally, we're already hard at work on Elite 2.0, with several innovative features being developed to work hand-in-hand with our next Call of Duty release, and look forward to sharing more details with you on it in the coming months.","So in total, even though it's still very early for Elite, there's much to be excited about. It has the potential to take connected multiplayer gaming to a new level, providing tremendous value to our players while at the same time creating a new long-term digital revenue stream for the company. Beyond Elite, we will continue to invest to expand Call of Duty's franchise by entering new markets and establishing new business models. Our studio in Shanghai is working hard on our first large-scale, free-to-play, micro-transaction Call of Duty game for the large and growing Chinese market, and we look forward to updating you on its progress.","We're very excited about all of the Call of Duty Elite growth initiatives that I just discussed. And remember, these only represent what we have announced publicly. There are more initiatives in the works that we expect to be able to share with you in the coming months.","Now I want to talk about Skylanders. As you know, developing new IP is one of the most challenging parts of this business. And we are happy to say that our new IP, Skylanders, exceeded expectations and achieved a number of impressive milestones. This is why driving the Skylanders momentum is one of our biggest objectives of this year. In 2011, Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was the #1 kid video game in the U.S. and Europe, including toys, and was the largest new IP launch in Activision history. And per NPD, in the U.S., if you include toys, Skylanders would be the 10th best-selling game of the year and the only game in the top 10 that is not a sequel.","In just 2.5 months, this unknown IP generated more than $200 million in sales, including the sale of more than 20 million toys worldwide. And the momentum for toys has shown no signs of slowing. As Jerry Storch, CEO of Toys\"R\"Us, recently said, \"The game was an enormous success last holiday, and the toys seem to evaporate as soon as they arrive on store shelves.\" We simply have not been able to keep up with the toy demand, and that is after shipping more than 20 million toys.","These facts not only validate this new mode of digital and physical play, but they also validate our strategy to focus on our biggest opportunities. In 2012, we expect continued sales of Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure, and we\u2019ve just unveiled the next step forward for the incredible franchise with Skylanders Giants. Giants features 8 new super-sized figures and a new slate of more than 12 regular-sized Skylanders that are key to the evolving storyline of the game. We're also innovating the toys with new light technology, which will be integrated into the Giants so that they glow when they're on or near the portable power without batteries. The Giants -- with Giants, we plan an even more innovative and exciting rollout this holiday, and we'll benefit from the franchise's awareness, increased retailer support and installed base of starter packs to drive sales. I hope you all get to see Giants at Toy Fair next week in New York City.","In addition to launching Giants, we plan to further expand Skylanders -- the Skylanders experience by one, growing the Skylanders\u2019 Web world. Today we have approximately a million registered users, and we expect to increase that number by offering more content and features, some of which will be monetizable. Two, launching the game on the iOS and Android platforms, making the experience even more accessible and engaging. And three, increasing the presence of the brand through licensing and partnership opportunities, which gives kids exciting new ways to interact with the Skylanders all year round.","Today, the combined toy and game industries generate more than $100 billion in sales. And with Skylanders, we are now participating with a hit in both. Given the momentum we have seen and the strong product marketing and online plans we have, we believe that Skylanders has the potential to be our next $1 billion franchise.","In fact, Jerry Storch from Toys\"R\"Us joined us again for the launch of Skylanders Giants earlier this week and said that he expects Skylanders to become one of the most successful toy franchises in history.","In addition to Call of Duty and Giants, we're excited about the open-world action game, PROTOTYPE 2, our wholly-owned IP which is expected to launch in Q2. There's a strong core fan base for the game, which has landed it on several lists of the most anticipated games of the year. We think we'll grow it by making the sequel even better and more satisfying to core gaming fans.","On the licensed IP side, we expect to release The Amazing Spider-Man game in conjunction with the theatrical blockbuster release this summer. We also expect to launch TRANSFORMERS: FALL OF CYBERTRON in the fall and to have releases from Wipeout and the long-standing successful Cabela's franchise, just to name a few.","Looking further out, we continue to lay the foundation for our new universe from Bungie, one of the world's best developers. Bungie continues to make incredible progress on what we expect to be a genre-defining new IP that will provide us with tremendous new opportunities and which remains one of our key strategic growth pillars for the future.","And lastly, we're willing to make significant yet prudent investments in opportunities like IP, tech, emerging platforms and new business models, and are always analyzing opportunities. When I came to Activision 1.5 years ago, investors told me they wanted to see 2 things: less dependence on the annual Call of Duty release, and new future revenue streams. So in just one year, we have not only shown the ability to continue to grow the Call of Duty franchise, we've also diversified the business, making it a true year-round business with several different income streams and growth vectors within it. We've shown the ability to make our revenue more predictable with the fastest-growing subscription service, Call of Duty Elite, and set new standards for year-round DLC business. And with Elite and Skylanders, we have added not 1 but 2 new revenue streams with large-scale potential. Add this to the longer-term, large-scale potential of our Bungie game, and I believe we are well positioned for the future.","In summary, 2011 was a breakthrough year. And looking ahead, we have an incredibly strong portfolio of games and in development are several exciting new properties and initiatives. We will continue to focus on our biggest market opportunities where we can develop and sustain a true competitive advantage and where we can bring true differentiated best-in-class experiences to our players. I'm looking forward to updating you on the plan and performance as this exciting year unfolds.","And with that, I'll now turn it over to Mike Morhaime who'll provide you with an update on Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime","Thank you, Eric. I want to quickly recap our activity from 2011. We launched both StarCraft II and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm in China and introduced the localized version of World of Warcraft to the fast-growing Brazilian market. We also announced the expansion sets for StarCraft II and World of Warcraft and kicked off the beta test for Diablo III. We're preparing to launch multiple titles in 2012. And with the next BlizzCon scheduled for 2013, our development teams are focused on bringing these games to players as quickly as possible.","Moving on to financials. In large part due to the record-breaking Cataclysm launch in 2010, our results in both Q4 2011 and the year are down versus prior year. Despite not releasing a new game, we still posted approximately $500 million in operating income for 2011 while investing in our strongest pipeline of games ever.","Subscriber numbers for World of Warcraft ended 2011 at approximately 10.2 million, with no significant change relative to the prior quarter. We released a major update in November, which included new dungeons and raids, as well as new features that made our exciting raid content more accessible to a broader audience.","This content update has been well received by the community, and we believe it has contributed to retaining our players in the wake of competitive launches. Another initiative that has been very successful is the World of Warcraft Annual Pass. This program was announced at BlizzCon this past year. Under its terms, players who commit to being a World of Warcraft subscriber for one year will get a free copy of Diablo III, unique digital items in World of Warcraft and other benefits. To date, we have signed up more than 1 million players in the West for the World of Warcraft Annual Pass.","Some of you may have seen recent news about the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion, Mists of Pandaria. Last week, we began inviting global press to visit our office to get a hands-on look at the game. The press visit will take place next month, and our players will be able to read the latest news on the game on March 19. We're looking forward to showcasing the game to our community and collecting more feedback as we prepare for the upcoming beta for Mists of Pandaria.","I mentioned earlier that we began beta testing for Diablo III last year. After receiving feedback from the community and our internal teams, we've implemented changes to the game, which we believe will greatly improve the game experience and ensure that the final release will live up to our high expectations. We have also been testing the auction house functionality. This testing will help ensure a smooth rollout of this feature with the retail launch so our players can safely and securely trade items with each other. Given the popularity of the Action\/RPG genre and the keen interest in Diablo III, we expect this launch to be a big opportunity for Blizzard. We can also confirm that we are targeting a Q2 launch for Diablo III. We expect to announce more details about the release schedule in the coming weeks.","On the StarCraft II front. 2011 was definitely a banner year for eSports. One of the most popular leagues in the world, Major League Gaming, posted their more successful year ever. MLG has served more than 3.5 million unique viewers over the course of the year, with much of that viewership driven by StarCraft II. We believe that the excitement for eSports drives longevity and demand for our games. And with the recent announcement of our Battle.net World Championship season, we're looking forward to taking an even more visible leadership role in this space.","As part of the Battle.net World Championship initiative, Blizzard will work with eSports partners to create grassroots open tournaments at the national level to boost engagement in countries around the world. The reaction from our community on this initiative has been very positive, and we are looking forward to another exciting year for eSports.","In the midst of all the eSports buzz, the StarCraft development team has been making great progress on the new expansion, Heart of the Swarm. The feedback we collected on the campaign and multiplayer content from this past BlizzCon has been invaluable. We will share more news about Heart of the Swarm in the coming months.","Finally, we continue development work on Blizzard DOTA, a new free-to-play online game which we showcased at the last BlizzCon. Blizzard DOTA is being created using the StarCraft II engine and is based on an online gaming style that's become quite popular in recent years. We believe Blizzard DOTA has unique design elements that will distinguish it from competitors. More importantly, our game will feature well-known heroes and characters from all Blizzard franchises in the game, giving it instant recognition and appeal among Blizzard gamers. As with Heart of the Swarm, we're looking forward to sharing more news about Blizzard DOTA at a later date.","We expect 2012 to be a big year for Blizzard, with easily our strongest pipeline of games ever. With multiple titles expected to launch in 2012, we're committed to bringing our players what they want most, new gaming experiences in all their favorite Blizzard universes. And I speak for everyone at Blizzard when I say that we all can't wait to join them on Battle.net in the battlefields of Blizzard DOTA, Diablo III, Heart of the Swarm and Mists of Pandaria.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Kristin.","Robert A. Kotick","Kristin?","Michael Morhaime","Kristin?","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Yes. And now we're going to let the operator take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.","Jeetil J. Patel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Can you talk about -- I guess, when you look at this year, your online business did $1.56 billion in revenue. If we kind of look at your guidance for the year, is it safe to assume online is going to be the fastest-growing segment, probably more like mid-teens type of growth as we look at that $4.5 billion number? And then second, as you look at Call of Duty Elite premium, you've got about a 20% pay rate. Do you think that this pay rate picks up? Or for 20% participation, Elite premium picks up as we progress the year and the different updates come out throughout the year?","Thomas Tippl","Jeetil, let me take the first question, online growth. We think that outside of World of Warcraft subscription revenue, all other digital revenue streams will show significant growth year-over-year. But as you know, we're starting the year with a lower WoW subscriber base. So I think -- our planning assumption at least doesn't include that we're going to lap the strong numbers we have delivered in 2011 on WoW subscriptions.","Robert A. Kotick","With respect to Elite, Jeetil, it's early days. When you look at the value, if you just take the value of downloadable content and the discount that would be applied to all the DLC, Elite is an enormous value. And I think as you start to roll out the service on multiple platforms, you'll start to see that, that rate has a possibility of improving.","Operator","And next we'll go to Neil Doshi with Citi.","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mike, I was wondering if you could provide us a little more detail around the subs for World of Warcraft. What was the impact from some of your marketing efforts? And then how many subs did you add from Brazil? And if you have any comments on trend that you could share with us, that would be great.","Michael Morhaime","Okay. So we were very pleased with the results of the marketing initiatives in Q4. The Chuck Norris spot was very effective. We've got over 29 million views of the spot on YouTube. And I think, just looking at how well the subscribership held up during our most competitive quarter ever, we're very happy with that. Engagement of the player base is very strong. We do not break down regional. We do not provide regional breakdown of subs, but we're off to a good start in Brazil. And I don't have any detail on churn.","Operator","And next we'll move on to Brian Pitz with UBS.","Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up question from the last one on World of Warcraft, given the subs. Obviously, the competitive launch was very late in the quarter. Can you give us any indication on what users have actually done since the end of the quarter? Have you seen churn ramp up post that launch? And then a quick question on Call of Duty. Despite strong results, very strong results for the franchise, if you look at the NPD numbers for December, they\u2019re actually below last year's levels for Black Ops. Can you give us any color there?","Michael Morhaime","Well, the most significant thing from the World of Warcraft standpoint for us was the launch of our free content update at the end of November where we made significant improvements to the end game, which is extremely important for long-term player retention. And the community response to the update has been very positive. And as we've seen with other updates like that, it has been successful in driving engagement. And I don't -- we don't provide interim updates in terms of post-quarter end, other than to say our strongest competitor did launch in December, and December was a good month for us.","Eric Hirshberg","And as for Call of Duty and the NPD data you cited, I would answer by saying that we had a very effective launch. And part of that launch was our most effective and aggressive pre-order program ever, which drew a lot of the business forward. So I think it's not unexpected that the shape of the curve looks a little bit different than years past immediately following that. But the launch was the most effective ever. The pre-order program was the most effective ever, and it's the best-selling game ever in a single year.","Robert A. Kotick","If you recall, we did $1 billion in 16 days, which, for any entertainment medium, was a record.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","Guys, I was wondering if I can get a sense of how big Skylanders might be as a percentage of revenue in 2012. And just in general, non-COD or World of Warcraft as a percentage of revenue in 2012? And then separately, there's just been a lot of discussion recently about online gambling, and I was just wondering how Activision could potentially play with that -- play in that with its current brands or even potentially just going into traditional casino games. Any thoughts on that would be great.","Robert A. Kotick","It\u2019s really 2 things, Ben. All we have to say about Skylanders in 2012, it\u2019s going to be giant. And there won't be any Skylander gambling this year. So Skylanders, a lot of momentum. We had some limited supply last year on toys. We're working to correct that as quickly as we can. We think the product plan for Skylanders this year is outstanding, and we've been very pleased with the success so far. On online gaming, while we have expressed an interest and we think that there's opportunity, it's a very long-term opportunity.","Operator","And moving forward, we will hear from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Another question on Warcraft. It looks like your subscription revenues, your revenues for the game, not just subscriptions, were down about 10% sequentially. And given that the subs were relatively flat, I was wondering if you can give some color around why, I guess, the ARPU was down so much.","Thomas Tippl","Yes. One of the factors that impact that is our Annual Pass promotion where we effectively, for the combination of products, gave a certain discount through the free delivery of Diablo and amount. So we're applying that discount on a pro rata basis across all of those products. So we've been recognizing on both Annual Pass subscribers lower market subscription run rates...","Eric Hirshberg","Effective at the time [indiscernible].","Thomas Tippl","Than what you've seen before we started the Annual Pass promotion.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Brian Karimzad with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If you don't mind providing an update on the Call of Duty development in China and maybe how some of the coming releases of competitor titles there is causing you to maybe change course a bit on development? And then on free cash flow, Thomas, do you mind walking us through some of the factors in the decline? And was it the free cash flow itself that kept you at a lower realized buyback level in '11 versus '10? And how we might need to think about that for '12?","Eric Hirshberg","On Call of Duty China, in relation to your question, the development is going very, very well. And we feel that the level of graphic fidelity and gameplay that we're seeing will be breakthrough for the competitive marketplace. In terms of other competitors entering the market, we simply feel that we come in with a tremendously strong advantage, and that Call of Duty is already viewed as the premium first-person shooter in China, very high awareness going in. And the game itself will over-deliver we believe for the competitive set.","Thomas Tippl","And on your cash flow question, and you will note that last year, we delivered cash flow significantly above net income, which was possible because we made some significant improvements on the inventory front as we were unwinding the Guitar Hero business, so obviously, that's an event that doesn't happen every year. If you look at our free cash flow as a percentage of net income, we always said we should be trending above 80% of net income in terms of free cash flow. We continue to do that. And then cash flow, the free cash flow number for the year, the balance sheet item happened on one particular day in the year, which is December 31. There are always some shifts back and forth between the year from a receivables or a payables perspective. But I think our cash flow is fundamentally strong. Our net income to free cash flow conversion is strong and continues to track ahead of our 80% objective. So we feel pretty good about that.","Operator","And our last question will come from Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of questions on Call of Duty Elite. Can you talk a little bit about what the engagement is like of Call of Duty Elite from your paid subscribers versus the free users of it? And also, can you comment a little bit about the growth rate of paid subscribers since the game has launched? Is this something that should remain somewhat static between now and the release of the next Call of Duty title? Or should it build as we get closer to that title over time?","Eric Hirshberg","I'll answer your second part of your question first. We think that there will be natural spikes surrounding the release of DLC, and that it's sort of, if the current patterns are any guide, it\u2019ll remain somewhat constant between those spikes. But as more and more DLC becomes available to play, the value of the $50 subscription rate gains in value for subscribers. As far as engagement, it's very early going. We've seen strong engagement from our paid subscribers. We've seen, not surprisingly, slightly less engagement from our free subscribers. But overall, we had some technological bumps at the very beginning that led to some frustration in our user base. That's why we gave the first month away free. And since we've stabilized the service, we see the engagement increasing.","Operator","And that is all the questions we have time for at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Well, thank you all. On behalf of everyone at Activision Blizzard, we thank you for your time and consideration and look forward to speaking to you in the future.","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"658":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Our first quarter results exceeded our prior outlook reflecting strong operating discipline. We are refocusing our resources on our biggest franchises to deliver the operational excellence for which we are known. As we outlined last quarter, we are increasing our focus and investment on our biggest franchises in order to better execute and unlock their great potential.","In prioritizing our franchises and the communities of players invested in these franchises, we're staying true to the approach that drove our Company's long-term success, doing a few things very, very well. We're continuing to selectively invest in new potential franchises, but our focus is innovation with improving franchises of which we have many.","In today's content landscape, our franchise focused approach is more relevant than ever. Gamers are playing fewer games longer, creating and sustaining new franchises remains one of the most difficult tasks in the entertainment industry and only proven teams that have the vision, talent, scale and resources to create market break-out new intellectual properties and there are even fewer of those teams that have the capabilities to sustain those games over time and meet players' ever-increasing demands for ongoing features services and content.","We're very fortunate to own some of the most enduring and popular global franchises supported by some of the very best teams in the world. Well over 0.5 billion users have played Candy Crush over the seven years since the franchise launched. Call of Duty recently passed its 15th anniversary and is one of the most successful entertainment franchises of all time with cumulative sales exceeding 300 million games.","Overwatch and Diablo have tens and tens of millions of players and this year the Warcraft franchise celebrates its 25th birthday. Over a quarter of a century massive numbers of players have engaged in Warcraft, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone experiences. We expect to enjoy the dual tailwinds of strong industry growth and company-specific opportunities is that we have crafted for our own intellectual properties.","There are more gamers than ever before and more ways for gamers to interact with our franchisers than ever before. We have clear opportunities to grow the reach, engagement and monetization of our franchises including through some very new business models. We have vast experience in all business models including free-to-play and we are continually evaluating the most effective models to all of our games.","In addition to this opportunity for our core business, we have company specific growth opportunities as we add new engagement and monetization models to our franchises including eSports, in-game advertising and digital consumer products and we're making great progress in these areas.","In eSports this quarter we launched the 2019 season for the Overwatch League with an expanded roster of 20 teams and strong growth in viewership with hours this season up more than 30% year-over-year. Leading brands continue to recognize the opportunity to engage a hard-to-reach demographic deeply immersed in the highest eSports experiences and in the content that has the highest production value.","We're very pleased to add Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola and State Farm to our roster of blue-chip sponsors in the last three months. One of the critical building blocks of the Overwatch League is the city-based model with team owners around the world building fan communities who share the passion of supporting their local teams.","In Q1, we announced the teams will compete in home and away matches around the world beginning in 2020. Highlighting the excitement and atmosphere of this next phase of the Overwatch League last weekend Dallas Fuel hosted the league's first home games in front of the cellar crowd of thousands of fans, who saw them compete against the Los Angeles Valiant and the Houston Outlaws.","Following the blueprint, we established and validated with the Overwatch League we've now started the team sales process for our professional Call of Duty eSports league, and we're seeing strong demand for teams. We've already sold five franchises. We have secured exceptional owners for each of Atlanta, Dallas, New York, Paris and Toronto, and in each case, we're partnering with existing Overwatch League team owners, who have first hand experience of our eSports vision and capabilities, and recognize the scale of the opportunity for the global city-based Call of Duty league.","We look forward to announcing more details around these cities and other team sales in the coming months. As always, we're grateful for the support of our employees, our players, our partners and our shareholders.","And now, Coddy will review the highlights of our operations for this quarter with you.","Collister Johnson","Thank you, Bobby. Focus and operating discipline enabled Activision Blizzard to outperform our first quarter outlook. Strong performance for Candy Crush, better than expected sales for Sekiro and favorable cost timing were key factors driving upside. We also continue to reposition the business to take advantage of our future growth opportunities. So before diving into the specifics of our quarterly results, I'd like to update you on some of the most important steps, we've been taking since our last call.","As a reminder, we have four key long-term strategic growth drivers: first, a strong cadence of major content releases where we meet the growing demand of the industry's gaming communities and release our high-quality content more frequently; second, robust live operations where we make sure we deliver great content, services, features and events to continuously engage our communities and drive in-game revenues; third, extending our franchises to mobile where we build on our existing mobile leadership and extend our acclaimed console and PC franchises to the largest and fastest-growing platform; and fourth and finally, expanding the reach engagement and monetization of our franchises as we build on early success in eSports in-game advertising and consumer initiatives.","Now a critical step to realizing its growth opportunities is reinforcing our product pipeline. Now, as I discussed last quarter, we are growing our aggregate developer head count on Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Diablo by 20% this year to accelerate the delivery of content in our pipeline and give our communities more opportunities to engage.","To share some of the detail of the work underway, we're organizing the expanded development teams to better support the delivery of both upfront content and live operations with more talent working on getting the games in our pipeline out to our communities, and also more resources dedicated to following up with the volume and the quality evening game content that gaming communities increasingly expect.","We're also meaningfully increasing the number of developers working on mobile initiatives. Across our key franchises, those resources are complementing experienced, creative talent, already working on projects including mobile expansions of existing games, mobile-first reimaginations of our franchises, and cross platform titles. These are ambitious projects that will take time, but we're committed to delivering on the substantial opportunity they hold.","We're also investing in our tech platforms, building cross-platform tools and capabilities that make us more agile in content delivery, increase the opportunity for collaboration across our development teams, and ensure we control our tech future. And we have more resources now available to work on the optimal business models for each of our franchises, including assessing opportunities around free-to-play.","We're fortunate to have exposure to every type of gaming business model at scale in our company, and in recent quarters you've seen us experimenting with free-to-play reach initiatives across more of our portfolio. Our inside teams are conducting tests, to understand the content, marketing and timing implications of these different business models, and to deliver for the needs of our players. We look forward to sharing more with you here in due course.","Now we are also building on the momentum of our fourth strategic driver of new engagement and revenue models, by adding resources to our eSports business and continuing to invest in tech and sales resources for advertising the Q1 again highlighting progress in both these initiatives.","In addition to these investments and expanding our key franchises, we have a major program underway to integrate global and regional sales and go-to-market partnerships and sponsorships capabilities and we expect this project to help better leverage our talent, expertise, scale and productivity across our business. While the work, I just described, will bear fruit in the future. We remain focused on delivering in the near-term as well. I'll now review our Q1 results through the lens of our three key metrics reach, engagement and player investment.","Starting with reach, the company had 345 million monthly active users in Q1. Activision monthly active users were 41 million with around half of the quarterly sequential decline due to the exclusion of Destiny monthly active users. As you've seen on previous occasions Call of Duty reach saw some impact from a more competitive backdrop. However and importantly, our core player base remains highly engaged with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's total hours played growing double-digits year-over-year versus World War II.","We continue to release new content, modes and events to sustain reach and attract new users. But we also recognize that we need to do even more to maintain the breadth of our Call of Duty player base beyond the launch quarters and the Call of Duty team is hard at work on that for this fall's big content release excitement for which is incredibly high around the organization.","We expect that both the launch and post-launch content will bring game-changing experiences to our fans. Also in Q1, we announced that Call of Duty mobile will be coming to regions including North America, South America and Europe. While we continue to plan prudently for this new initiative, as you would expect we see significant potential for Call of Duty on mobile over the coming years, given the franchise's, global recognition and the growing demand for first-person action games on mobile.","Q1 also saw the highly successful release of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, the resulted Activision's approach of selectively partnering with top quality developers, to leverage our publishing and marketing scale and expertise. We couldn't be more pleased with the collaboration's execution and the response from suffers critically acclaimed title from gaming communities worldwide. Blizzard monthly active users were 32 million, lower year-over-year reflecting the gap since the major content launch, and the fact that we are still in the early innings of expanding our in-game content capabilities.","We highlighted last quarter that increasing the flow and the frequency of compelling in-game content and upfront releases is the number one goal set by the new Blizzard leadership team. That process will take time. We've seen encouraging signs in how recent in-game content has been received by Blizzard's communities.","Overwatch monthly active users are saw a single-digit percentage sequential decline in Q1, due to the fact that Q1 was a relatively quiet quarter for in-game content and consumers had increased choice in the team-based category this quarter. That said, the community's enthusiasm for Overwatch was again evident in how they embraced both the archives, storm rising event in April and the new workshop mode that went to public testing last week.","For Hearthstone, April set a launch of its latest expansion Rise of Shadows resonating well with the community. Early signs are encouraging with the release driving greater player engagement than the prior two expansions. And this year the Hearthstone team has much more in-store including the biggest player versus environment content in franchise history, the first wave of which will be revealed in mid-May. Also this year, Blizzard celebrated its 25th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise as well as the 15th anniversary of World of Warcraft.","Over that time Warcraft has developed a global audience with multiple award-winning games in different genres including over 100 million accounts created for World of Warcraft and over 100 million registered players for Hearthstone. Later this year, we'll celebrate the special milestone for Warcraft with some highly anticipated releases.","World of Warcraft Classic will be available as part of the franchise subscription over the summer letting fans play the game just as it all began 15 years ago. In addition, a large content update to World of Warcraft called Rise of Azshara is already on test servers and will include new zones, new dungeons and more. And Warcraft III: Reforged due this year is a complete reimagination of our real-time strategy classic rebuilt from the ground up for high-definition PC experience.","King monthly active users were 272 million in the first quarter up 2% from Q4. This second straight quarter of sequential monthly active user growth was driven by the Candy Crush franchise where monthly active users again grew both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.","This growth in franchise monthly active users seven years after launch of Candy Crush Saga again illustrates Kings strong ability to expand its audience through new content and ongoing live operations.","Candy Crush Friends with its accessible gameplay based on learnings from the Candy series continue to attract both former and new players to the franchise. Monetization and retention trends remain strong in Q1, enabling ROI positive user acquisition that we expect to continue to contribute to financial results in the coming quarters.","King continued to drive both reach and engagement through updates, features and events. In fact, Candy Crush saw record time spent per daily active user in Q1, driving the King network to a new high of 38 minutes for daily active user during the quarter, which brings me to our second key metric engagement.","For each of Activision Blizzard and King, daily time spent per user in our games increased year-over-year and for the company overall average time spent was approximately 50 minutes. At Activision for Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 engagement of Black Ops drove double-digit growth for both total hours played in the quarter and daily time spent per player versus last year's title. Playing games is just one of the ways in which our communities engage with our franchises.","As Bobby mentioned, our professional Call of Duty city-based league initiative is off to a strong start. We are thrilled to have sold our first five teams to great owners that we already know well from our partnerships in the Overwatch League. And for Blizzard, BlizzCon returns to the Anaheim Convention Center on November 1 and 2. The Blizzard teams can't wait to host their community at the ultimate fan event in gaming.","Player investment is our third key metric. In-game content, features and services delivered approximately $800 million of in-game net bookings in the first quarter. King was the biggest contributor with two of the top 10 highest grossing titles in the U.S. mobile app store for the 22nd quarter in a row.","Call of Duty in-game net bookings was lower year-over-year, but the team continues to iterate around in-game features and offerings within Black Ops 4, testing new ways for players to participate in in-game content both for that game and for future titles.","And as mentioned, we are increasing our developer headcount and investing in our platforms to ensure our teams have the resources and tools they need to deliver the in-game experiences that our players expect for the future.","In summary, during Q1, we made important progress on resetting the foundation for future growth. Increased investment in our biggest franchises sets us up to better deliver on the upfront leases and in-game content that our communities demand and to extend our franchises to mobile and new engagement models. While we position the company for the long-term, we've also remain focused on executing against our near-term financial outlook, and we are off to a solid start for 2019.","Dennis, will now review the financial results and outlook in more detail.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Coddy. Today, I will review our better than expected Q1 2019 results as well as our outlook for Q2, and the full-year. To review the quarter, I'll start with our segment results. Activision revenue of $317 million, increased 2% year-over-year. Key quarterly contributors were Call of Duty in-game and catalog net bookings, and the successful launch of Sekiro. Operating income was $73 million with an operating margin of 23%, which was lower year-over-year primarily due to mix effects.","Blizzard revenue of $344 million was in line with our expectation. Operating income was $55 million lower year-over-year due to a decline for in-game revenues, partially offset by lower cost. Blizzard's operating margin was 16%. King revenue of $529 million was roughly flat year-over-year.","Candy Crush net bookings grew year-over-year with the ads business more than doubling over the same period. Operating income was $178 million with an operating margin of 34% down 2 percentage points year-over-year due to investment in marketing for Candy Crush Friends.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.83 billion, $110 million above our February outlook. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $567 million.","Net bookings of $1.26 billion were $83 million above our February guidance. We incurred a GAAP only restructuring charge of $57 million and generated Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.58 and Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.78, which was $0.15 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.47.","In terms of cash flow and the balance sheet, in Q1 we generated operating cash flow of $450 million and ended the quarter with approximately $4.8 billion in cash and investments, and a net cash position of over $2.1 billion.","Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q2 and for the full-year. In Q2, Activision will continue to support Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 with content and updates to keep players engaged and late in Q2, Activision will release Crash Team Racing nitro fueled on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.","In April, Blizzard released the Overwatch Archive Storm Rising event, and its latest Hearthstone expansion Rise of Shadows. This will be followed by Hearthstone's biggest ever single-player content later this month. And the World of Warcraft team will support the game with future content and updates and events. And of course King will continue to deliver innovative features events and live ops across its portfolio. We will follow this up in the second half of the year with our most important release, our new Call of Duty title from Activision.","In addition, Blizzard will release World of Warcraft Classic and Warcraft III: Reforged and we will deliver more in-game content for Candy Crush and our other key franchises across the rest of the portfolio.","Now I'll provide just a little extra context before I turn to our guidance. First of all, we feel very good about how our content line up is shaping up, but it's obviously still very early in the year. Our biggest and most important card launch is not until Q4 and the environment remains competitive.","In addition, our earnings over performance in Q1, was primarily driven by the timing of expenses. With the bulk of our content lineup still ahead of us, we are still planning to incur these expenses this year, particularly as we see an abundance of opportunity to invest and support our franchises including new business model opportunities as Coddy referenced.","Note that consistent with our prior guidance, we continue to assume no material income for new mobile initiatives for Activision Blizzard this year. We also do not expect to recognize material revenue from Call of Duty eSports team sales this year. And as a result, we are reaffirming our net bookings, net revenues and EPS outlook for 2019.","Now let me get into the specifics. For Q2 on non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.32 billion including the recognition of GAAP deferrals of $165 million. We expect net bookings of $1.15 billion. Product cost, game operations and distribution expenses of 25% and operating expenses, including software amortization of 59% and a GAAP only restructuring charge of approximately $35 million. We expect the tax rate of 24%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 771 million, and EPS of $0.21.","For Q2, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 25%, and operating expenses including software amortization of 49%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 which includes the recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.12.","On a non-GAAP basis for 2019, we expect net revenues of $6.03 billion including GAAP deferrals of $275 million. We expect net bookings of $6.3 billion. Product cost, game operations and distribution expenses of 25%, operating expenses including software amortization of 55% and a GAAP only restructuring charge of approximately $150 million. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 24%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 774 million and EPS of $1.18.","For 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 25% and operating expenses including software amortization of 45%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.85 which includes GAAP deferrals of $0.25.","So in summary, Q1 was a solid start to the year and the team did a good job of in staying focused through a time of change. We've made clear progress in repositioning the company to take advantage of the tremendous potential in front of us. The competitive backdrop remains dynamic, but our internally owned franchises, developer talent and geographic platform and business model diversity create a powerful foundation for longer-term growth.","We still have plenty of work ahead. And we need to remain focused on execution, but I'm confident that our plan will position us to deliver strong results for all of our stakeholders over time.","Now I'll welcome our business leaders Jay, Humam and Rob as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call, Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much. Just circling back to your comments on the Overwatch League, how is it performing versus your expectations? And how is that translating to sort of player engagement or monetization of the game? And I guess any further color you can give on the Call of Duty city-based league.","Robert Kotick","Sure. This is Bobby. As I've said, we continue to lead the way in professional eSports. For us the most important thing always was being able to celebrate professional players who make the commitment to our games and inspire our players every day. But I think what we found is that as a result of our eSports initiatives, we're creating a lot more enduring appeal in these franchises.","When you think about sports and sports teams, they are the ultimate examples of everlasting franchises. And the reason that we've created this city-based global league is to be able to attract that same passion and affinity that only city-based teams can really foster as we grow the fan base and as we want to deepen the engagement that our players have with our franchises.","I would say lastly, we've seen a tremendous opportunity to create value for our shareholders through our eSports initiatives. If you think about the last couple of years, the results that our team focused on eSports has achieved is remarkable.","If you look at the amount of time it would've taken in traditional sports to sell over $0.5 billion worth of teams, I don't think there's any example of being able to do that in a couple of year period of time.","Viewership continues to grow on the Overwatch League and we're now generating much more substantial revenues from the broadcast rights and from sponsors and licensees. So from a commercial perspective, the league is doing really well. Between Overwatch League and now the five Call of Duty teams that we've sold, we have over 25 teams that have generated that $0.5 billion of revenues, and the prices for the Call of Duty teams were well ahead of what the initial prices were for the Overwatch League teams.","So we've got great owners. We've got a lot of commercial momentum. I think we've got a great season that we're off to this year for Overwatch League with viewership up substantially. And overall, I think we continue to lead in our initiatives of professional eSports. And with respect to the gaming, I'll leave to Jay you can answer the gaming question.","J. Allen Brack","Yes. I think the game sentiment, the player sentiment for the game remains positive. We continue to have an active player base even though we're approaching our 30th anniversary. The teams are continuing to add features for content and for support engagement.","Last week, we released Overwatch workshop on the public test realm. This is a mode that allows players to really be very flexible and very creative and really build their own game modes giving some of the power that the developers have to the players. Early reaction has been positive, and I think we're excited to see what players are able to create.","Over the rest of the year, we'll continue to add new heroes and new maps and new experiences. And last quarter I talked about how we have very large ambitions for the Overwatch universe and how it can develop over time. And for us it's going to be a balance of working on the existing game as well as the team focusing on other work that they have.","Overwatch is a huge tentpole franchise for Blizzard and we're continuing to dedicate the resources and the attention, so that we can continue to grow the community and the franchise over time.","Robert Kotick","Thanks, Alexia. Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Baird.","Colin Sebastian","Great. Thanks. Just want to follow-up on the comments on free-to-play and given the success in the market for free-to-play title and battle royale as well, I wonder if you could provide a little more of an update on the company's strategy to take advantage of these trends? Thank you.","Collister Johnson","Sure. This is Coddy. Thanks Colin. No specific update today, but I think you\u2019re right to ask how we think about the broader context of it. And as you highlighted, there's a lot of dynamic growth happening in this industry today. I think it's first worth stepping back and talking about broadly how we see that growth because it speaks to why we reposition the company that we have. But we see real growth taking place in in-game revenues, in mobile, in Asia, in free-to-play and in eSports, I just mentioned and in in-game advertising.","And so for us the repositioning is really about setting up the right resources to be able to dedicated to those growth initiatives and take advantage of them as we head into the coming years. I specifically know about one of those growth areas in the industry where you see Battle Royale free-to-play coming together.","And as we mentioned, we did see some reach impact in our franchises from competitors, who combined that approach in the space. But I think just as importantly, we see real opportunity for our franchises, where we can expand the reach of our ability to go to consumers as we look at that opportunity across our portfolio.","I need to start, though. Our north star is always compelling content and great engaging gameplay. It has to start there. It is why we have multiple business models in the company because different gameplay lands itself to different kinds of monetization, and what we're always trying to do is to make sure we have a growing ecosystem of a great player experience in the ecosystem of reach, engagement and monetization. But we are constantly re-examining these ecosystems.","If you just look at Call of Duty for instance, over the last decade, we've done multiple things to really evolve that model with evolving player interest from different upfront pricing, to different passes, to different post-launch content approaches and offerings, and we continue to consistently examine those ecosystems.","And part of coming to this year and the repositioning of our resources to make sure we had enough available not only to do what we've traditionally done, but to be able to test new approaches to look at the data, to understand what consumers really want and to be able to take advantage of some of those growth opportunities.","I do want to make one thing clear that just in closing, which is \u2013 we know that the upfront content that we sell for a premium has significant appeal to players, and that they're very pleased by the AAA experiences we can provide as an upfront sale. So we will continue that model. But our additional resources allow us to really look at a number of additional opportunities to take advantage of these kinds of growth areas.","Robert Kotick","Thanks. Operator, can we have a next question please.","Operator","Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Kunaal Malde with Atlantic Equities.","Kunaal Malde","I want to ask about King MAUs, because we've now seen two quarters of sequential growth. So how are you thinking about the outlook for the King Player base going forward?","Humam Sakhnini","Yes. Hey, Kunaal. It's Humam. Let me take that one. So as you saw, we had monthly active users of 272 million across King network this quarter, and it's kind of worth just remarking I think of how strong that network is and I'm really pleased to see that we have two quarters of sequential growth. It's really the first time we saw that since Q1, 2015, which was the quarter after we launched Soda.","And I'm equally pleased that that growth didn't come at the expense of average engagement. As you heard, we had record time spent for daily active user. Now it's about 38 minutes. You might have heard us last year we talked about that we're going to put more focus on our reach initiatives, and clearly we're seeing some of that pay off.","And as I think about we also had some really strong marketing opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on, you should bear in mind we're a very, disciplined marketer. So we're always looking at positive ROI user acquisition opportunities and those do vary from quarter-to-quarter.","But within that framework, what we do is, look at ways that we can always unlock more marketing investments and we do that by introducing new features in our pipeline, which drive engagement and monetization and that now includes advertising, which then enables us to invest more in user acquisition and feed the network.","And as an aside, we saw strong momentum in advertising in Q1. So overall, really happy to see that stabilization and we're going to continue to be disciplined in how we balance reach and user acquisition cost in the coming quarters.","Robert Kotick","Thanks Kunaal. Can we have a next question please?","Operator","Thank you. We'll take the next question from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","Thank you so much for the question. I just have one on Hearthstone. It seems like that's a property where bookings may have been declining for several quarters now. Is there anything specific to point to that's been driving that weakness, whether that's been competition in digital collectible cards or just a normal revenue curve for a game that's been very successful over five years? And are you assuming any sort of inflection in the Hearthstone trajectory following the launch of Rise of Shadows in April? Thank you.","J. Allen Brack","Hi, this is J. I just wanted to kind of say that Hearthstone is a great franchise for us. The game launched a little over five years ago and it's got over 100 million players. We also feel really proud that the game has such a large global appeal.","For engagement in the game it's moved around from year-to-year depending on where the Meta game \u2013 the Meta of the game that set at being one-time. How the latest expansion is landing and sort of resonating with the community. And what sort of new features are have been introduced in the game.","We do think that Hearthstone can be larger in the future. We have a lot of confidence in the team in both, leadership of the team and in the kind of direction they're taking for the game. We're adding more developers in the Hearthstone to create more of a content that the community really wants. And we also have some ideas for innovation that we want to accelerate.","You mentioned Rise of Shadows. We launched that in April. And we're really happy that it drove engagement above the previous two expansions. Throughout the rest of the year you'll continue to see different things that we add into the game.","The next thing up is our highly re-playable venture. That's going to come out this month. And it has substantially more content than we released in any previous P2P experience. And so overall we feel great about the surprises that that the team have and everything in some of sort of large player community.","Robert Kotick","Thanks Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. We will hear now from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","Tim O'Shea","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. With Dennis returning to the CFOC, I just thought it made sense to hear if there's going to be any changes in terms of the philosophy around M&A and capital returns. Thank you.","Dennis Durkin","All right, Hey! Tim. Thanks. I appreciate the question. This is Dennis. Well, you covered us for a long time so you obviously know we have a long track record of trying to be balanced, and disciplined in how we allocate capital across investing in the business strategic M&A or returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.","And the core component of that is always ensuring. We have a strong balance sheet. And we for a long time viewed that as a really strategic asset for the company and that gives you a tremendous flexibility as you think about making big bets. And when we find those compelling opportunities, we're not afraid to follow-up on them.","You've seen the benefits of that approach over time in both our Vivendi buyback in 2013 and also when we acquired King in 2016. In both cases we were able to deploy balance sheet cash and borrow in a disciplined fashion while we moved our way up the investment-grade credit rating grid.","And with rapid change in our industry, we think it's really important to maintain this kind of strategic flexibility and be disciplined about what's best for the company for the long-term. So yes, nothing has changed in terms of how we think about capital allocation philosophy and you should expect a continuation of our disciplined balanced approach going forward.","Robert Kotick","Yes, and I'll just add Tim because I'm off to Omaha for I don't know probably the 20 time for the Berkshire Annual Meeting that as you think about it's worth well for us as a philosophy over 29 years, we're going to always be the guys that wait for that \u2013 pitch. And when you think about that it's baseball analogy, we're not going to veer from the discipline that we had for that as a guiding philosophy.","Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. We'll now hear now from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Olson","Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, how you're feeling about the upcoming version of Call of Duty that's coming this fall. And also what's the latest you can share related to the prospects and potentially timing for Call of Duty mobile? Thanks.","Robert Kotick","Hey, Mike, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. So we continue to feel incredibly good about this year's game coming from Infinity Ward. The game's going to be revealed later this quarter. I think it's going to be really clear then why we're really so excited about the release.","On the mobile part of your question, obviously, we see significant potential for Call of Duty. We're starting to see first-person action games on the platform to attract really substantial audiences and we feel that with Call of Duty's global appeal, we can obviously see some powerful results.","Now as we've discussed before now approaching the mobile opportunity in two ways really, both through internally developed content and through partnerships. And in the case of what we recently announced the Call of Duty mobile, we're working with Timi one of Tencent's top studios. And Tencent's putting a ton of resource behind the game and it continues to shape up really, really well.","The results from all the regional tests that we've had have been really encouraging as is the interest in the community. And after we announced the Call of Duty mobile is coming to region outside of China, we saw over 10 million pre-registrations on Google Play for the game, which is a really strong and significant result for a new title.","We're also pretty encouraged by the resumption of approval in China, but we're not taking anything for granted here. As stated you can assume we're planning particularly prudently for that country and mobile overall. And to sum it up honestly, we feel just really good about the games that we have in the pipeline for the Call of Duty franchise this year and we're excited for their prospects. Thanks for the question.","Operator, can we have the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move on to Matthew Thornton with SunTrust.","Matthew Thornton","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe coming back to King and Candy Crush in particular, you talked in the past about how the franchise grew through some of the network disruptions last year. And my question here is, is that growth sustainable than we've seen recently? And can we expect some acceleration as we look forward here as we start to comp some of those network disruption issues? Thanks, guys.","Humam Sakhnini","Hey, it's Humam again. We've had a really strong quarter for Candy franchise as you heard. And yes, the network disruption in Q2 last year did cause a step-down in reach and monetization. So when you think about the year-on-year net bookings growth it really illustrates the durability over the long-term of the franchise. I will say that since that disruption, we stepped up our internal initiatives to build more direct connections with our players.","But on the durability point, I just want to highlight how evergreen the franchise is that we've created there. The Candy franchise bookings grew year-on-year in 2017, again in 2018, and now continued into Q1. Shows kind of the strength of this franchise, which first launched in 2012. And ever since Soda was launched in 2014, Candy has had two of the top 10 grossing titles, and the U.S. app stores.","In my mind it comes down to our ability to do a few things here within the franchise, first is successfully developing market new titles within the franchise. So we launched Candy Crush Friends in 2018 \u2013 October 2018, and the retention and monetization trends on that continue to remain strong. And we prudently invest in our marketing opportunities to bring in former players and new players, and I discussed that earlier. We take a very disciplined ROI approach to that.","And third, we constantly innovate within our live titles and deliver players fresh new content and features. And we really think very thoughtfully about those pieces of content that we're putting in our live titles. So, I feel really good about our ability to continue executing in these areas and to deliver ongoing growth in the Candy franchise as a result of that.","Robert Kotick","Thanks, Matt. Can we have the next question please, operator?","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company.","Michael Hickey","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong Q1, good start of the year. I guess I was just hopeful that you could provide some additional color or maybe some \u2013 a little bit more visibility within your Blizzard pipeline. Thank you.","J. Allen Brack","Hi. This is J. Thanks for the question. This is an important topic for everyone, and it's super important to me personally. I said consistently that the Blizzard pipeline is larger and richer than ever before. It includes PC and console releases.","It includes ongoing content for World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone and a couple of mobile initiatives. It's critical that all these products meet the Blizzard quality that we're known for. We want to give the teams the space to really create excellence and release games at a better and more consistent kids.","We're pretty impatient to get all those content in front of the community and it's a reason that we have significantly increased our developer head count as we talked about last quarter. The teams are highly motivated. We feel we've got a lot to prove, both to our players and to ourselves. And lastly, we just talk about \u2013 Coddy talked about earlier announcing BlizzCon and the show is returning November 1 and 2 to the Anaheim convention center and working really hard to make it great event.","Robert Kotick","Thanks. Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our last question from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Costa","Hi. This is Matthew Costa on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the cloud gaming opportunity, there's obviously been a large number \u2013 number of large payers going into the space between Stadia from Google and now Microsoft with Project X cloud. Can you contextualize that opportunity in your view and give any thoughts on those new platform entrants? Thank you.","Robert Kotick","Yes. Thanks for the question. It's Bobby. When you own 30 years of IP like we do, there's probably never been a better time to be in the games business. And when these big well-funded companies are building out platforms that they have limited amounts of content to actually serve up to customers. I'd say that there's a great opportunity for a company like ours.","I think for starters they will all try to broaden the audience for gaming and make big investments and commitments in doing so. And that's just helpful for a growing market. But in each case none of these platforms can succeed without great content. And truthfully, they don't really know how to make it.","So, when you think about what will be required it will be support from us to allow them to actually build audience. And I think that we have a better opportunity than most to capitalize on all these new platforms that will be there.","In addition, to the fact that we have almost 350 million direct relationships with our own customers today and so distribution is evolving and changing in the way that we actually connect with our own customers. So the net, I would say as you think about the next five to 10 years, there will be more ways and places to engage players and that serves us better than almost any other company.","Christopher Hickey","All right, thank you everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing many of you I guess in L.A. for E3 perhaps next month then if not then see you on the call next quarter. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participation. You may now disconnect."],"656":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christopher Hickey, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's third quarter 2018 conference call. With us are: Bobby Kotick, CEO; Coddy Johnson, COO; and Spencer Neumann, CFO. And for Q&A, J. Allen Brack, President of Blizzard; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.","A number of factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and those on the slides that are showing. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 8, 2018.","We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets and expenses related to acquisitions, including legal fees, costs, expenses, and accruals, expenses related to debt financings and refinancings, restructuring charges, the associated tax benefits of these excluded items, and the impact of certain significant discrete tax-related items.","These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com, for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures.","There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you all for joining us today.","Our results for the third quarter exceeded our prior outlook, as we continue to entertain large audiences, drive deep engagement, and attract significant audience investment across our franchises. Last quarter, on average, 345 million people played our games each month, and our players spent a record 52 minutes per day playing Activision, Blizzard, and King games.","Our unique advantage is the ability to create the most compelling interactive and spectator entertainment based on our own franchises combined with our direct digital connection to hundreds of millions of customers in over 190 countries. With these competitive advantages, we continue to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment.","Very few companies are able to consistently deliver compelling content to hundreds of millions of customers. Fewer still can provide their audiences with flexible methods of payment for that content. For our hundreds of millions of customers, we now offer content on phones, computers, and video game consoles, and subscription billing, direct digital download billing, virtual item sales, digital advertising, and of course, we still sell our products through tens of thousands of stores around the world.","As an example of the breadth of our capabilities, we launched Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 on October 12. Ordinarily, we launch new Call of Duty titles this week in November. But we believe holiday customers, of which there are millions, will benefit from more players in the game earlier.","Our engagement to date is better than any Call of Duty content in recent years, and spectator viewing is higher than ever before. As a franchise, Call of Duty has now generated more revenue than the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the box office, and double that of the cumulative box office of Star Wars. We have an exciting future planned for Call of Duty players, including our new Call of Duty professional player opportunities, and lots of exciting new content in 2019 and beyond.","We remain focused on the key growth drivers of our business that we believe present meaningful revenue and engagement upside, including live operations, mobile, and investment in new and growing franchise engagement models. We're pleased with our early momentum in areas like our advertising initiatives, which continue to exceed our plans, as revenues grew almost 50% sequentially.","And we are further strengthening our leadership position in esports, having now sold 20 teams globally to the Overwatch League at substantially higher prices because of league financial over-performance versus our original plans, and the energy that was brought through the first season of the league by our new owners. As always, we thank you, our community, our shareholders, and our partners as well as our talented teams around the world for all of their support and hard work.","And now on to Coddy.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Bobby.","Activision Blizzard exceeded its outlook in Q3, and we remain on track to deliver our previous upwardly revised outlook for the year and double-digit earnings per share growth year over year. We were able to achieve these results because of our incredibly talented teams comprised of the best creative and commercial leaders in the industry and their focus on the four key growth drivers of our business.","First, our team produced new content releases that invigorated distant communities and bring in new audiences. Second, our growing stream of live operations, which includes content, services, features and events that engage our franchise communities and encourage new players to join. Third, the expansion of our existing franchises onto mobile, the world's largest platform, and the creation of new franchises. And fourth, new and growing franchise engagement revenue models such as esports leagues and digital advertising.","On the first driver, our teams continued to deliver exceptional innovation and execution with major new content releases for Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush. These content releases reinforce a strong foundation for our second growth driver, live operations. We generate over $4 billion a year in net bookings from in-game content, which represents the growing majority of our net bookings, yet still offer some of the best value per hour in all of entertainment. We see the continued improvement of our live operations model as one of our largest growth opportunities with the potential to generate billions of dollars of high-margin incremental revenue as we deliver year-round in-game content for our community.","We have robust engagement in content roadmaps in place for our key franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush. Now, not all our franchises are experiencing the momentum we see in Call of Duty and Candy Crush. And we have to improve the pace of innovation and the cadence of in-game content, and our franchise and business unit leaders are all now committed to achieving that goal.","On our third growth driver, the expansion of our franchises onto mobile, we know that many of the most successful mobile games today are based on intellectual property originally created for consoles and PCs. As an example, we've seen this ourselves with Hearthstone, where the fan base grew significantly when we added the mobile platform to a game that isn't even yet fully optimized for mobile success.","Mobile remains the largest and fastest growing platform for gaming in the world. And while King is a clear leader in mobile, we're still investing in Activision and Blizzard franchises for mobile releases. For example, Activision is collaborating with Tencent on Call of Duty Mobile, taking the biggest action franchise of the last two decades to the largest gaming market in the world, and of course also to western audiences where, as Bobby pointed out, Call of Duty is already one of the most successful entertainment franchises in history.","And last week, Blizzard announced Diablo Immortal, which will bring this tenfold franchise to a mobile audience in both the east and the west. While fan reaction was muted to the announcement, players' hands-on experience [indiscernible] this content confirmed what we believe, which is that Diablo mobile will be a very well received game when it releases, and players around the world will love it.","These are just two of the many mobile initiatives underway across Activision and Blizzard. And King mobile expertise is now being shared throughout the company so our beloved PC and console franchises can expand their reach.","Lastly, on our fourth driver, in new and growing franchise engagement models, Overwatch League is already well into planning its second season, and we are actively advancing how the league model and infrastructure will be applied to Call of Duty and other franchises. And our advertising business continues to grow profitably, exceeding our plan. While net bookings are still relatively small, they grew almost 50% quarter on quarter. And while investment in these new initiatives is growing, we are confident in the value they will create for our fans and for our shareholders.","So with that framing for our growth drivers, let me share our Q3 results against our three key metrics, reach, engagement, and player investment. Starting with reach, which was 345 million monthly active users in Q3, King monthly active users were 262 million, relatively stable through Q3, which is a positive outcome following the Q2 partner network challenges we described on the last call.","Importantly, monthly active users for King's largest game, Candy Crush Saga, grew year over year. And in October, King launched the all-new Candy Crush Friends Saga, which builds on five years of learnings in Candy with new modes, collection mechanics, and 3D visuals that make the Candy Crush characters and our owned IP more prominent and the game really fun to play.","Candy Friends targets the over 0.5 billion people who have played Candy Crush over the last five years, for whom the innovation and accessibility of Friends should be particularly appealing. We're now focused on Candy Crush Friends to win back former players and entice new players. The game is off to a strong start, reaching the top of the iPhone game download charts in 93 countries. And while still early, retention and monetization trends are very positive, and the game is on pace to drive meaningful growth for the Candy franchise in 2019.","At Blizzard, monthly active users were 37 million, consistent with the prior quarter. Overwatch monthly active users were broadly stable quarter over quarter. Hearthstone monthly active users declined, although PvP modes again attracted strong engagement. The game continues to add new players, with the franchise reaching 100 million players to date since its launch in March 2014.","World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth launched on August 14 and set a day-one franchise record by selling through more than 3.4 million units. Engagement grew sharply quarter on quarter, and the expansion saw strong participation in value-added services, with more content on the way in Q4. Next year, Blizzard will celebrate World of Warcraft's 15th anniversary with events both in and out of the game. This includes the highly anticipated release of World of Warcraft Classic, available as part of the franchise subscription.","Activision monthly active users were 46 million, up sequentially from Q2. This sequential growth was driven by Destiny's expansion, Forsaken, and by new reach initiatives, which grew Destiny monthly active users quarter on quarter and year over year. Now while Forsaken is a high-quality expansion with strong engagement and new modes of play, it did not achieve our commercial expectations, and there's still work to do to fully reengage the core Destiny fan base.","Then in October, Activision saw step-change growth in its monthly active users following the very successful launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. Building from the foundation of Black Ops 3, which was the highest grossing game in Call of Duty franchise history, Black Ops 4 is off to a strong start, with creative innovation across all modes of play, including Blackout, which we see as the ultimate AAA Battle Royale experience.","Unit sell-through after the first three weeks is pacing ahead of Black Ops 3, PC sell-through more than 3 times higher, and with significant shifts to full-game downloads. Total active users in the first three weeks are up 16% over Black Ops 3, with strong growth across all modes, and engagement and hours played is up over 20% versus Black Ops 3. So it's worth underscoring that given Black Ops 3 generated more in-game net bookings than any other Call of Duty title, this level of engagement in Black Ops 4 should result in strong in-game revenue in Q4 and into 2019.","This brings me to engagement. Across all our franchises, daily time spent per user playing our games reached a new record of 52 minutes, based on some of the franchise reach and engagement drivers just highlighted. Usage of our games is also up significantly. And just last month, Activision Blizzard titles accounted for seven of the top 20 most viewed games on the industry's largest streaming platform, including Black Ops 4, where viewership continues to break franchise records.","In the Overwatch League, we continue to build on the success of the inaugural season, announcing another 16 sales in September, spanning Europe, Asia, and North America, all at substantially higher valuations than team prices in the first season. Nine of our now 20 teams are based outside the U.S. reflecting the global appeal of the league.","BlizzCon, which is the ultimate celebration of Blizzard community engagement, drew millions of viewers around the world by live stream and over 40,000 fans in person. In addition to the reveal of new content for every franchise, we announced the expansion of the Diablo franchise onto mobile with Diablo Immortal, codeveloped with NetEase.","Diablo Immortal was built from the ground up for mobile as an authentic Diablo experience that will make the franchise available to hundreds of millions of people around the globe. We're confident when the game launches, it will be a great experience for new players as well as the extremely loyal and vocal Diablo community. We know how eager that community is to experience even more from Diablo. When the time is right, the team will share more about what else they have in store.","Turning now to player investment, in-game net bookings were over $1 billion in Q3, which helped to set a year-to-date record of $3 billion. King was the biggest contributor with two of the top 10 highest grossing titles in U.S. mobile app stores for the 20th quarter in a row, and Candy Crush Saga was again number one. As I said earlier, some of our franchises are underperforming relative to the opportunity that we see in building our live operations capabilities, and we'll continue to push innovation and new content to drive stronger engagement and in-game revenue generation.","Black Ops 4 is a great example of how successful we can be when we focus on improving engagement in our franchises. We made the game even more engaging with active users and hours of engagement up sharply versus Black Ops 3. With Black Ops 3, that engagement translated into significantly higher in-game revenues. We hope to further that opportunity with Black Ops 4. So we continue to execute strong in-game revenue, and monetization should follow.","In summary, while there is still execution risk in the year, we're pleased with the results of our recent major content releases of World of Warcraft, Candy Crush, and Call of Duty, and we are excited by the momentum behind engagement and live operations we see in some of most critical franchises: We remain focused on improving our live-ops revenue, engagement, and in-game performance across all franchises. We continue to execute on our promising mobile initiatives and expand our franchises to new engagement models, including esports and advertising.","Spencer will now review the financial results in more detail.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Coddy. Today I'll review our Q3 2018 results and our outlook for Q4 and the full year. To review the quarter, I'll start with our segment results.","At Activision, Q3 segment revenue was $397 million. Key contributors were Call of Duty digital in-game revenue and Destiny 2: Forsaken, although the latter underperformed our expectations. Segment operating profit of $112 million was lower year over year versus a quarter that included the Destiny 2 full-game launch and continued benefits from the Q2 2017 release of Black Ops Zombies downloadable content and Crash Bandicoot.","Blizzard grew segment revenue 20% year over year, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth. This offset lower revenue for Overwatch and Hearthstone, with the latter facing a tough comp against the record launch of the Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion in the prior year. Segment operating profit increased 13% year over year, as revenue growth offset investment in strategic initiatives, including Overwatch League, other esports activities, Battle.net, and franchise incubation across multiple platforms.","King segment revenue and operating income were 4% and 12% lower year over year respectively against a particularly strong quarter last year with no partner disruption. As we noted on the last call, we started Q3 from a lower revenue base due to the Q2 partner network disruption, but saw strong engagement and increasing monetization trends through the quarter.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter, we generated Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.51 billion, which was $22 million above our August outlook. This includes the net deferral of $146 million. Net bookings of $1.66 billion were $43 million above our August outlook.","We generated Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.34 and Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.42, which was $0.18 and $0.05 above outlook respectively. These figures include the net deferral of $0.10. GAAP EPS benefited from a discrete tax item resulting from adjustments made to the provisional amount initially recorded for the U.S. Tax Reform Act.","Now from a cash flow and capital structure perspective, Q3 operating cash flow was $253 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and investments. Our strong cash position enabled us to pay down $1.7 billion of high-yield notes and floating rate debt in the quarter, reducing our go-forward net interest expense by roughly $40 million on an annualized basis. In parallel, we expanded our revolver capacity from $250 million to $1.5 billion to provide us with increased levels of liquidity. These actions further strengthened our balance sheet and increased our financial flexibility.","Now let's turn to our fourth-quarter and our full-year outlook. Before getting into the specifics, I want to provide some context. As we noted on our last few calls, earnings in the year are heavily weighted towards our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 to benefit from major content releases, strong in-game revenue, and key marketing and other commercial initiatives.","Our recent major launches for World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Candy were all very successful and will set the stage for continued opportunities in 2019. Some of our other franchises, like Destiny, are not performing as well as we'd like, and we're working to accelerate the pace of live operations innovation and improve the speed with which we release new content to keep our players engaged and to provide new opportunities for monetization.","Also, our better performance than our outlook in Q3 included timing benefits and FX rate headwinds. FX represents an approximately $40 million reduction to second half revenue since we last provided a full-year outlook. While we recognize that we face market and franchise headwinds and will continue to have execution risk through the end of the calendar year, we're confident in our strategy and in our team, and we're maintaining our revenue and non-GAAP EPS outlook for the fiscal year.","For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect: net revenues of $2.236 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $812 million; product cost, game operations, and distribution expenses of 23%; and operating expenses, including software amortization, of 55%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $6 million, a tax rate of 28%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 776 million, with EPS of $0.43.","For Q4 on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs, game operations, and distribution expenses of 23%, operating expenses including software amortization of 47%. And we expect non-GAAP interest expense of $5 million, a tax rate of 23%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.64, which includes GAAP deferrals of $0.63.","For 2018, on a GAAP basis we expect: net revenues of $7.355 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $120 million; product costs, game operations, and distribution expenses of 23%; operating expenses including software amortization of 53%. And we expect GAAP interest expense of $113 million, a tax rate of 9%, and GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 772 million, with EPS of $1.94.","And for 2018 on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs, game operations, and distribution expenses of 23%; operating expenses including software amortization of 44%. And we expect non-GAAP interest expense of $70 million, a tax rate of 18%, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.46, which includes GAAP deferrals of $0.12.","The foundation of our business remains strong. Recent launches further strengthen our enduring franchises. We're focused on driving strong engagement and in-game performance across our entire portfolio, and we'll continue to make progress in our mobile expansion and new engagement models, including leagues and advertising.","We're committed to driving our four key growth pillars while maintaining the fiscal discipline that our shareholders expect, and we continue to see opportunities across the entire landscape of interactive entertainment.","We'll now open the call up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take the first question from Tim O'Shea of Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes, thank you for taking my question. Just wondering if you could update us on the Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 launch, and maybe with an update on how that game is performing post-launch. Thank you.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure. Hey, Tim. This is Coddy. Well, we're confident and we're energized by the performance of Black Ops 4. The launch, as I said, is off to a strong start on both console and PC. As Bobby said, there's a lot more time left now given the decision we made to launch it earlier in the holiday window and in the gift-giving window, which we think is a good opportunity for players to come in and join this highly engaging game.","And the Call of Duty team is doing what it knows how to do well, which is build a deeply engaging experience. And it's just worth highlighting again what we know so far in some of the stats coming through, which is that versus prior title and versus Black Ops 3, total active users are up significantly. And overall engagement, again, versus both the prior title and Black Ops 3, is up over 20%.","So that first period of building that deep engagement block of players that really want to come in and play is off to a good start. But we built it, as we said on multiple occasions, for long-lasting engagement. We doubled down on multiplayer in Zombies, which are already strong engagement drivers, and we added to that the kind of content and progression and system designs that you see in there to give deep playability and content for months and years to come. And we added Blackout, which is a deeply appealing mode, particularly for those who are looking for that AAA Battle Royale experience.","So the next step is just to continue to build out on the live system operations, the design. And really what is happening now is the live engagement or responding to players and seeing where they go and building the services and features that engage them even more deeply. So looking at it, we see a great run coming for Black Ops 4 and really for the franchise as a whole.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you. Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Yes, and our next question will come from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you. I guess I'd like to focus a little bit on the leadership transition of Blizzard, and if you could put a finer point on what we should expect to see change and what should stay the same. And also related to that, if you could provide a little more color on the pipeline from Blizzard. Thank you.","J. Allen Brack - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, this is J. I'd like to just start off by saying that Blizzard is a hugely storied studio, and I couldn't be more honored to take on the role. I have been at Blizzard for more than a decade, but have really been a fan of their games my entire life.","Today, I have a strong view on many of our franchises, and I'm actively working to get a broader outlook on certain teams, certain commercial groups, esports operations that I already have a good view of from my previous job. Coming out of that process, I feel like I'll have a larger perspective on what the next chapter for Blizzard's growth is going to look like.","We're going to need to continue to invest in content in our existing franchises, and there's work to do to improve in some areas to better serve our communities and to create more content for all of our fans. That's our number one focus. And we'll continue to invest in the reach of the different franchises that we have to acquire more players globally across all platforms, including PC, console, and mobile. Right now, we have the strongest multiyear pipeline we've ever had, which is a huge opportunity, and delivering against that pipeline is our number one priority.","I think Blizzard's focus is always going to be on delivering quality game play first. And we have a strong culture of values, and we want to create more content and deliver more games. And we think that's going to lead to more players, more engagement, and it's going to lead to great business results.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Certainly, your next question will come from Raymond Stochel of Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question. How should we think about King's pipeline and your efforts in mid-core mobile titles versus your historical success in more casual titles? Thanks.","Riccardo Zacconi - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Ray. It's Riccardo here. So when I think about our development efforts, our focus is first to fall on cash flow and our franchises, and in particular on Candy Crush, since it's our largest franchise. We have a large network of users playing our casual games, and this is the key reason why our first priority is to retain and engage them. And for doing this, we invest in a steady stream of new content and the new features for our live franchise games, and we also develop new titles for our established franchises.","Last month we released Candy Crush Friends. It's our newest title in the Candy franchise. And it's a key part of our strategy to retain and engage existing players, but also to win back our large lapsed audience. You heard Coddy earlier. Candy Crush Friends is off to a great start. It exceeds our expectations on some key metrics, and I think it's the most polished Candy Crush game we have ever released. The characters are brought to life like we have never done before. And Candy Crush Friends strengthens the Candy franchise as a whole as we are going into 2019, and I'm very excited about this game in the future \u2013 and its future. This is for casual.","We invested actively also in other genres and other games where we see opportunities, and we do this both internally and through partnerships. Earlier this year, we released Royal Charm Slots in a partnership with PLAYSTUDIOS. The game has not yet met our expectations around retention and monetization, and so the team is still working on it.","In regards to mid-core, we released Legend of Solgard in August. It's our first mid-core launch. And mid-core is a space we want to develop a strong position over the long term, and this game will allow us to learn more about the genre and how to build out the space.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Riccardo. Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And our next question will come from Drew Crum of Stifel.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. You touched on this a little bit, but maybe spend a little more time on the health of the Destiny franchise and just what you've seen in terms of engagement post the Forsaken launch. Thanks.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure, thank you. This is Coddy. I guess I'd start by reiterating that Forsaken is a high-quality expansion of content into the universe. Honestly, it's the highest-quality content we've seen in the franchise to date. It really came out of Activision and Bungie working together to address community concerns post-Destiny 2 holistically. Talking to players, we knew it came from users really doing a fundamental review of how to offer a deeper end-game, greater powers and greater rewards, and engage players who seemed to be really enjoying the content. In particular, it was very well received both by reviewers and by the community, and has ongoing deepening engagement by those that are playing it.","At BlizzCon, we announced that Destiny, the base game is free for two weeks, meaning download it by November 18, and you get to keep the base game forever. We did that because we want the whole community loaded up and able to play it, but also because it's a live game. And once you're in it, with the ongoing features and services and content, there's really deep engagement that takes place. And part of it was also because we have not yet seen the full core reengage in Destiny, which has led to the underperformance against our expectations to date. Some players we think are still in wait-and-see mode. So when you're in, you're deeply engaged. If you're not, we're hoping now is the time to work and to bring players back in and to win them back.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking my question. Just on Diablo Immortal, can you give us a little more color on Diablo Immortal, and how we should think about the timing of that?","J. Allen Brack - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, this is J. So we've seen some interesting reaction to the announcement. I think that it's clear that there are a lot of players who are eager for more Diablo PC and console content. I think that came through loud and clear from BlizzCon. And frankly, we feel fortunate to have a community that cares so much about that franchise. The commitment and the engagement of our community is, I think, one of the things that makes Blizzard very special. It's something that we really appreciate, and we like to hear the things that they articulate as to what they want to hear next and what we can do better, frankly.","Diablo is an important tent-pole franchise for Blizzard Entertainment, and we have \u2013 one of the things we said is we have multiple teams working on multiple different projects for the Diablo community. We feel that Diablo Immortal is going to deliver a very authentic Diablo experience, and we're not going to compromise on that mission. Launching the game is only going to be the beginning. There's going to be ongoing support, and we're only going to release the game when we feel like it is meeting the community's very high standards. In the end, Diablo Immortal is going to fulfill that, and we think that people are going to experience it, and we think that they're going to love it.","Regarding I think the opportunity for Diablo and specifically on mobile, I think it is a very significant opportunity. Mobile is the biggest platform in gaming today. And taking a game like mobile onto that platform in a way that is really reflecting our quality standards I think can really open a lot of \u2013 it can open that franchise and other franchises to a global audience, including people who don't have PCs, or especially in China where Blizzard is a very, very strong western brand.","Regarding the timing, that's something that we'll talk about as we go forward. It is very important that we release the game and it is an excellent, excellent experience when it is released.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","One other thing to add, Brian, is when we got the feedback from people who actually had the chance on a hands-on basis to play the game, it was really positive.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Certainly, we'll move on to Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, this is David Karnovsky on for Alexia. Just for King, can you provide an update on your advertising outlook and maybe what the contribution of ad revenue was in the quarter or year to date? Thanks","Riccardo Zacconi - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, it's Riccardo here. So as you heard earlier from Bobby, the ads business is performing above plan in Q3. The team has great momentum as we head into the year end, and this is off the back of some strong progress in scaling our network and in building demand.","Our ads team has worked closely with the game teams to integrate ads into the key titles.","And in Q3, we made good progress in each of these areas. The number of video ad impressions on the platform nearly doubled in Q3 versus Q2, and we're seeing a strong growth in the number of advertisers committing to meaningful campaigns on our platform as well as growth in the average spend by these clients.","We're now going to build on this progress. First of all, we're focused on scaling further the ads across our network, and we're doing this by enabling ads for even more players in the games where ads are already implemented and also introducing ads to more games.","And then we're also building an even greater demand on the sales side. We believe that rewarded video is a great format for brand advertisers because it associates brands with a positive experience in the game and therefore a positive experience in the player's mind. And because with over 90% completion rate, this leads to a strong brand recall. So we think that the rewarded video is a great format, and it's a format that is unique to games.","In the longer term, we want to roll out the ads business also to the other parts of the Activision Blizzard group. And so I think if I have to summarize, I feel very good about the progress this year in ads. And as the ads business continues to scale, I expect it to become an even more meaningful contributor in 2019.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Operator, can we take the next question, please?","Operator","Up next we have Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could provide more color on the World of Warcraft launch to date as well as just any info you could share on plans for more content in between major releases. Thanks.","J. Allen Brack - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Mike. This is J. Obviously, this is a question that is very near and dear to me. I worked on World of Warcraft for more than 12 years. Battle for Azeroth is another great World of Warcraft expansion and is performing in line with expectations. I'm really proud of the team, who over the last few years has done just an amazing job of really delivering great expansions at a regular cadence, but also adding more content and updates than ever before.","The expansion launch that we have for Battle for Azeroth and the ongoing content is really how we are going to continue to engage players between expansions. The WoW team has a very strong content plan as a follow-on for Battle for Azeroth. The first content update is called Tides of Vengeance, and it's going to come out the week of December 10. It'll feature two new raids, a new war front, new island expeditions, new allied races. We have some classic battlegrounds from World of Warcraft that we're remastering, and we're going to add some seasonal content as well. Later planned updates are going to add new zones, dungeons, and raids for people to explore and additional PvP arena. As always, we have a really close relationship with the community and try to respond to all the player feedback and continue to listen and make improvements in the game.","For 2019, something we've been working on for a while that I'm also very excited about is the return of World of Warcraft Classic to the community. We announced at BlizzCon that anyone with a World of Warcraft subscription will have access to both the modern World of Warcraft as well as WoW Classic.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks. Operator, can we take the next question?","Operator","And our next question will come from Brandon Ross of BTIG.","Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned earlier PC sales for Black Ops 4 were up three times over Black Ops 3. Any way you could give additional color on the Black Ops PC performance on Battle.net and maybe how you think about the game's future on PC? Thanks.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure, thanks. This is Coddy. I think first, it's worth stepping back to remember why we decided to make the investment in PC around Black Ops 4 and development resources in the way it's archictected to the platform to go to market. And there will be five or six reasons in there.","And so just to frame those so that we can pressure test how we're doing against them, the first is it opens up Call of Duty to a broader, more global audience as we take it to platforms that reach around the world like PC. Second, because of the nature of the game and the kinds of modes and engagement that we're seeing really lend themselves to PC, particularly for multiplayer for Battle Royale, of course. Third, because we're now able as a company to integrate Call of Duty with the Battle.net platform, which is a big thing and a very important development. And it's not only just a compelling best-in-class PC platform, we also have a much deeper and richer understanding of our players because they're now on our network and on our platform.","We think the time is right for Call of Duty, as you know and as we've talked about, to be expanding across platforms and to be working across console and PC together. And then obviously, PC comes with better profitability, given that it's entirely digital. And because it's on our platform, the economics accrue to us.","So those are the five or six things about why we would do this. And the investment really does seem to be paying off. As you said, the size of our PC business is growing multiples, which is good and a good start. And we've been able to launch it to scale on Battle.net to markets we have not had access to before in Asia, particularly in Korea, but also other markets still to come in Asia. And so there's an expansion for us there, particularly with the kinds of modes of play that we're seeing.","We also see, I think importantly, the broader PC community rallying around this title. A lot of that has to do with streamers and influencers who are coming in and really having fun as they play inside the game. And Activision has always had good relationships with influencers and streamers. But in this case, we've really taken it to the next level to service the community, to bring in those influencers and streamers, and give broad viewership and access to what's happening in that game.","So as we go forward, we think there's a lot of opportunity here. It's our own digital platform. There are many options for us in terms of how we market it and how we price it and promote it to new audiences around the world. And so we'll be leaning into that this quarter as we head into next year.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","All right, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Evan Wingren of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. I'm just wondering about the pace of digital downloads in Call of Duty, what you're seeing through the launch, and what you are expecting on a go-forward basis. Thanks.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure, Evan. This is Spencer. I'll take this one. So as you may recall, we talked about Call of Duty: World War II last year where we saw about a 30% full-game download mix, which was up pretty consistently with what we've seen in the past few years, about 5 points year over year. And based on what we're seeing so far in sell-through, we expect to see more than a 5-point shift this year. It's certainly too early to tell, but the full-game download mix has definitely been heavier, and that's a good thing for us. Digital brings us closer to our consumer. And again, as we talked in recent calls, it improves our overall economics. And that's just the console digital mix. The overall digital mix for Call of Duty should further benefit from the PC focus that Coddy was just discussing and that great collaboration between the Activision team and Blizzard on Battle.net.","And I should also say that this overall digital shift, it's certainly an ongoing consumer-driven trend, but it's also a lot of great work for our teams to create compelling digital offerings that are really driving additional digital adoption from our perspective, so overall, a lot of nice trends there.","We should also point out when we talk about this that Call of Duty is a mass-market game, so all channels are important to us while we are certainly driving digital adoption. And we'll see where we land here, Evan. We'll know a lot more as we get through the holiday season. But overall, the trends are strong. It's a long-term positive for our business with a lot of runway ahead.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","I think that's the last question. I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our holiday results next quarter, and we'll talk to you next year.","Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks very much for joining us.","Operator","That does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you all for your participation.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today's call over to Ms. Kristin Southey. Please go ahead, Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment; and Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of our SEC filings, including our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC, and those indicated on the slide that is showing.","The forward-looking statements in the presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, February 5, 2015, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.","I'd like to note that certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; expenses related to stock-based compensation; the amortization of intangible assets; expenses including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals related to the purchase transaction; and related debt financing and the associated tax benefits. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation. There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a 1-page summary sheet.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin. 15 years ago, our investors had very little interest in video games or video game companies. In fact, at that time, the Internet was creating great amounts of wealth, in fact, what we would consider more wealth creation than we've seen in modern commerce. And companies without page views and click-throughs were very out of favor. We thought it'd be a good time to start an Investor Relations program, but we had a very difficult time finding anybody that actually wanted to run it. And so we told the recruiter to start looking for out-of-favor industries, industries that were as out-of-favor as video games, and they couldn't find any anymore out-of-favor industry than tobacco. So fortunately, for our shareholders, we were able to pry away from Philip Morris Kristin Southey, who thought it would be more fun to extol the virtues of video games than investing in tobacco.","When Kristin joined in March 2000, the company had a market value of $337 million. During her tenure, the stock has grown at a compound annual rate of 23% versus the S&P at 4%, and at a rate that's greater than the rate of growth at Berkshire Hathaway, which, as you know, is our benchmark for almost everything.","Kristin has protected our treasury, she has collected our receivables with the smallest rate of bad debt writeoffs of any major company in the video game industry, and for me, she's always been a fantastic professional, great partner and a pleasure to work with. Kristin has decided to take some time off, something that her work ethic never allowed her to do during her 15 years that she's been with the company. Both Brian and I are very incredibly grateful for all her contributions and I'll miss her greatly. She has assured me, however, that purely for our own personal enjoyment, she continues -- she will continue to keep all of you analysts in line, especially Michael Pachter.","She's handing the reigns over to someone terrific and we're confident that Amrita will make Kristin proud as she leads our IR program and protect the legacy Kristin has created as one of the world's great IR efforts. So everyone in the room welcome Amrita, and thank you, Kristin, for all of your great contributions, for your extraordinary service, for your unyielding effort and for your incredible commitment to the principles of creating true stakeholder value. Thank you.","And now, I get to share of our record results. So of course, we'll be reviewing in detail in a moment our record results, but we had another incredibly successful year. We had record results across a number of different areas. We introduced new franchises with outstanding game play. We expanded on new higher-margin business models. We continued investing in some of the world's most important entertainment franchises, and we continued to attract extraordinarily talented people to our company.","In terms of results, on a non-GAAP basis, we delivered record earnings per share, which increased more than 50% from the previous year, double-digit revenue growth and higher-margin record digital revenues that represents an all-time high of 46% of total revenues. And we produced more great content in 2014 than ever before. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the #1 release of the year and the franchise's cumulative revenue is now over $11 billion. Destiny was the #3 new release of the year and attracted over 16 million registered users. Skylanders, with over 240 million toys sold life to date was, again, the #1 kids console game. World of Warcraft reached over 10 million subscribers and remains the #1 subscription-based MMORPG in the world. Diablo III is the #1 PC role-playing game of the year; and Hearthstone, which is named Game of the Year, has already attracted more than 25 million registered players.","Last year, we launched 2 of the most successful new entertainment brands, Destiny and Blizzard's Hearthstone. Combined, they attracted over 40 million registered players worldwide and generated more than $850 million in non-GAAP revenue, a testament to our team's proven abilities to capture the imaginations of millions of people around the world time and time again. This year, we expect to expand our leading franchise portfolio to 10, up from 5 franchises at the beginning of 2014. Our amazingly talented teams will continue to produce the world's best content for gamers. And today, our board has once again increased our dividend, authorized a $750 million share repurchase program and the repayment of another $0.25 billion of our debt. Today, we've return nearly $10 billion to our shareholders in dividends and repurchases since 2008. We have a growing portfolio as the very best entertainment franchises and great confidence in our long-term future.","I'll now turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2014 financial results, and then I will review our outlook for 2015.","2014 was a very important year that delivered strong financial results that exceeded our outlook, while setting the stage for growth in the years to come. In 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated double-digit revenue growth, record digital revenues, a 32% operating margin, a record EPS, which is up more than 50% year-over-year and operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion. From a capital perspective, we strengthened our balance sheet, paid a record dividend to shareholder, repaid $375 million of our debt and continued to invest in the strongest pipeline of new opportunities with high-margin potential in our history. Our financial performance was driven by our strong diversified product portfolio. This year, our top franchise has maintained their leadership positions, and we successfully expanded our portfolio of IP with Destiny and Hearthstone, which drove more than $850 million in combined non-GAAP revenue.","Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Also, the numbers I will be quoting are compared to the year prior, unless otherwise noted. Please also note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. Our Q4 results exceeded our outlook and were driven by Activision Publishing's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Skylanders Trap Team and continued sales of Destiny. In addition, Blizzard's World of Warcraft and Hearthstone also had a strong sales in the quarter. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion and an operating margin of 28%. We had interest expense of $50 million and our tax rate was 7%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted share count was 741 million and GAAP EPS was a record $0.49.","In Q4, the weakening of foreign currencies against the dollar did not have a significant impact on our results due in part to our hedging program, however, the lower euro and British pound rates will impact our outlook for the full year of 2015, which I will discuss in a moment. On a non-GAAP basis, for the quarter, we generated revenues of $2.21 billion, an operating margin of 41%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% and our quarterly non-GAAP EPS was a record $0.94. Our solid Q4 results capped a better-than-expected year. For the full year on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $4.41 billion, operating income of $1.18 billion, a tax rate of 15% and record EPS of $1.13.","On a non-GAAP basis for the year, we grew revenues 11% year-over-year to $4.81 billion. Digital revenues grew 40% year-over-year and accounted for a record 46% of total revenues. Our strong growth in digital revenue was driven by new and growing high-margin opportunities, including game downloads for consoles, in-game purchases from our first free-to-play game Hearthstone, and new offerings for World of Warcraft, including the pay character boost. Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.53 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 32%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 33% with adjusted EBITDA being defined as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation. Our tax rate was 20% and our EPS was a record $1.42. 12 months ago, when we gave our original non-GAAP outlook, it was $4.6 billion in revenue and $1.26 in EPS. So this year, we again exceeded our initial guidance with non-GAAP revenues exceeding our outlook by $213 million and non-GAAP EPS exceeding our original outlook by $0.16 or 13%. In terms of cash flow, it was another solid year where we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion.","Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had approximately $4.9 billion in cash and investments, of which $1.2 billion was held domestically. We had gross debt outstanding of $4.4 billion and net cash of approximately $500 million. And today, based on the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in our long-term performance, our Board of Directors approved 3 important capital allocation matters. Specifically, they authorized a $250 million repayment of part of our term loan, which we expect will be paid in February; authorized a 2 year, $700 million -- $750 million share repurchase program and approved an increased to our cash dividend per share to a record $0.23, a 15% increase over last year, which will be payable in May.","Now let's turn to our outlook. This year, we expect Activision Publishing to launch more content than it has in many years. The first launch of the year was Call of Duty Online for China. While we modeled minimal financial contributions from COD Online in our 2015 expectations, we and our partner, Tencent, are very excited about the long-term prospects of the game. This type of free-to-play opportunity takes time to ramp to full popularity and our focus in 2015 will be on building and growing the audience before meaningful monetization.","For Destiny, we expect to release an expansion pack in Q2 and to launch more new content in the back half of the year. With respect to Call of Duty, this is an important year for the franchise as we expect release multiple Map Packs, microtransaction content and an exciting new game in Q4 from one of our top development teams. For modeling purposes, we are planning on sales to be consistent with the Advanced Warfare. Additionally, in Q4, we expect to release an innovative new Skylanders' game. And finally, we are working on several unannounced initiatives that we will say more about in the months ahead.","In 2014, Blizzard generated record avenues and near-record operating income. The year was driven by Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, both of which generated significant revenues and income that will not have comparable releases this year. In addition, we expect WoW subs to decline as we have seen historically in the year following the release of a large-scale expansion.","In terms of new releases, in January, Heroes of the Storm Blizzard second free-to-play game entered closed beta. While we expect it will take time to ramp in monetization as it builds its audience, we are very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us with this game. In addition, this year, Blizzard will continue to release new content for Hearthstone as well as bringing the game to mobile devices later in the year. Lastly, Overwatch, which was just announced in November, is expected to go into closed beta later this year. While we are very excited about this new franchise, it has not been factored into our outlook. Finally, Blizzard will continue to invest in our own distribution platform, Battle.net, which will need to support a significantly larger audience and commercial capabilities going forward.","So before we review the 2015 numbers, I want to highlight a couple of important things. First, our planning assumption this year is for our tax rate to revert back to our normal long-term target of around 24%, up from 2014 where the strong international performance from Blizzard and the R&D tax credit drove the rate lower. And second, as I mentioned earlier, there will be meaningful impact on our results year-over-year due to the weakness in the euro and to a lesser extent, the pound. Approximately 50% of our annual revenues are generated overseas and an even higher percentage of our operating income is international. As the vast majority of our product development and headcount costs are U.S. based, we have fewer natural cost offsets to dampen the impact of currency translation. To put the decline in perspective, for 2014, the average euro-dollar exchange rate was $1.33, and today, our outlook assumes the euro rate of $1.13 for the balance of calendar year 2015. As such, our revenues and earnings will be translated to dollars at a much lower levels than in 2014. This decline is somewhat offset by our hedging activities which are reflected in our outlook.","Now let's review our 2015 numbers, which are based on spot rates as reflected in our slide deck. Note that revenue and EPS will increase if the euro or pound strengthens versus the U.S. dollar. For 2015, we expect GAAP revenues of $4.1 billion, product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 51% GAAP. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $201 million, and a fully diluted weighted average share count of 750 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21% and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.89. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.4 billion, product costs of 25% and operating expense of 45%. We expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24% this year, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.15.","To put the numbers in perspective, in 2015, FX accounts for 6 percentage points of the 9% decline of our non-GAAP revenue. Operationally, revenues are down slightly due to a lighter slate, investments in infrastructure and scaling of new properties with free-to-play business models. In 2015, as I mentioned, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.15. Note that $0.14 of the year-over-year decline is due to FX translation and $0.08 is due primarily to the higher tax rate. At constant currency and tax rate, EPS would be down approximately $0.05 year-over-year.","Turning to our quarterly outlook. In 2015, we expect a lighter first half of the year as compared to last year as we don't have a comparable launch to the high-margin Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, and we only expect modest contributions from Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm, as I mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.14 billion, product costs of 28%, operating expenses of 38%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 20%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 745 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37. For the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $640 million, product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 62%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.05.","So in summary, Activision Blizzard delivered record financial results during its transformational year. In 2015, despite currency headwinds, we expect strong industry fundamentals, continued expansion and investment in our franchise portfolio while keeping a keen eye on costs and a laser focus on execution. Today, we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing global opportunity in front of us. And we believe the investments we are making in 2015 will drive growth in revenue, operating margin and EPS in 2016 and beyond.","Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing had another record-breaking and industry-leading year. The North America and Europe combined, Activision Publishing was the #1 retail publisher and had 3 of the top 5 best-selling new releases of 2014. With #1 Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare; #3, Destiny; and #5 Skylanders Trap Team when including toys and accessories.","Starting with Call of Duty. We want to thank our growing community of millions of Call of Duty players for making Advanced Warfare the #1 console game globally, which has delivered well over $1 billion in sell-through, and far and away the #1 title worldwide on next-gen platforms. As we anticipated and discussed on our last earnings call and as we saw across the industry, old gen sales to retail were down year-on-year, but for this year, we expect next-gen growth to easily offset that dynamic. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the first game released on our new 3-year development cycle and, as a result, was one of the most highly acclaimed Call of Duty games in recent years. We're also looking forward to a very strong season of digital content for Advanced Warfare starting with our first digital Map Pack release, Havoc, which launched last Tuesday and included a new zombies co-op experience. I'm happy to report that sales so far are up double-digit percentages year-on-year, both for standalone Map Packs and for Season Pass.","And looking ahead to this year's holiday release, while we're not yet ready to discuss it fully today, we're excited to announce that it will be made by the team at Treyarch, whose last 2 games, Black Ops and Black Ops II, remain the biggest selling titles in franchise history. This fall's game will be Treyarch's first on the 3-year development cycle, it will be loaded with innovation and we're excited to share more details with our community soon.","In January, we brought the largest video game franchise in the west to the largest video game audience in the world with the release of Call of Duty Online in China. This is Activision Publishing's first major entry into one of the fastest-growing business models in our industry, free-to-play. While it's too early to project the performance, and we expect meaningful contribution will grow over time, initial consumer momentum is positive. The Baidu Index, which measures the volume of searches on China's main search engine and is widely cited as the indicator of brand's momentum, puts Call of Duty Online on par with the rollout of League of Legends.","Now, let's turn to Destiny. Along with our partners at Bungie, we broke industry records as Destiny became the biggest new intellectual property launch in video game history, and was the third biggest new release of the year in North America and Europe combined. Destiny now has over 16 million registered users with a massive audience of active players still averaging over 3 hours of game play per day, a figure that has stayed remarkably stable since launch. Destiny also performed the rarely seen console gaming feat of growing active players from November to December, driven by the release of the new expansion pack, the Dark Below. And it was the #1 played game in North America on a PS4 in December. In Q2, we expect to launch the game's second expansion pack, House of Wolves, and later this year, we will announce a major content release for the fall, so stay tuned.","On to our third tent-pole franchise, Skylanders. As of today, life-to-date retail sales for Skylanders has exceeded $3 billion. And in 2014, Skylanders outsold all action figure lines and was the #1 kid console game globally for the fourth year in a row, and as a franchise, outperformed its nearest competitor by 30%. Skylanders Trap Team, our fall release, outsold its nearest competitor by 17% and continued the incredible streak of breakthrough innovation in the franchise and was also one of the most highly acclaimed Skylanders' games today. This year, our toy sales grew as the unique mechanic of bringing toys and traps to life has kids and parents buying more toys and accessories than ever before. We expect to benefit from the next-gen installed base growth in 2015. And later this year, we will announce our next main release with yet another breakthrough innovation for the category.","So in closing, over the last 3 years, Activision Publishing has methodically expanded its portfolio, and for the first time in its history, now has 3 tent-pole properties, each of which generated over $500 million in non-GAAP revenue this year and drove the highest digital revenues in Activision Publishing's history. We expect Call of Duty Online in China will become an important new revenue contributor and lead the way with new play dynamics and business models. We also have multiple unannounced initiatives in development, which we will reveal later in the year. Finally, across our tent-pole franchises, Activision Publishing now has over 70 million players playing over 4 billion hours a year, a massive audience with a depth engagement that we expect to continue to grow and monetize over the coming years.","And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Morhaime to talk about Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime","Thank you, Eric. Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated and talented employees around the world. Blizzard Entertainment delivered one of our most successful years ever.","In 2014, we released award-winning expansions, World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, on Windows and Mac, and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls on Windows, Mac and consoles. We also launched our first free-to-play game, Hearthstone, which has collected Game of the Year awards and nominations as well. Hearthstone was released first on Windows and Mac and later on iPad and Android tablets, bringing Blizzard into the mobile space for the first time. Additionally, we supported Hearthstone with 2 major content releases, the Curse of Naxxramas Adventure and Goblins vs. Gnomes, our first expansion. Our success across multiple game genres and platforms in 2014 drove Blizzard's best-ever annual revenue, and more importantly, helped us continue expanding our global community of gamers.","","On the World of Warcraft side, we ended the year with the release of Warlords of Draenor in November. As we previously announced, the expansion was a great success in all regions, pushing the global player base above 10 million. The introduction of the character boost as well as design updates to the game made it much easier for lapsed players to return to World of Warcraft and quickly reintegrate themselves into the community. Looking ahead, we're already preparing new content and features to support the game in the coming months. As with previous expansions, we do anticipate a decline in subscribership in the coming months, particularly out of Asia, where the subscriber base has been more fluid.","Moving on to Hearthstone. The game continued to excite and attract players around the world. After announcing the Goblins vs Gnomes expansion at BlizzCon in November, we launched it a few weeks later in December. This was followed shortly after with the Android tablet version of the game. All this activity helped drive Hearthstone's highest monthly active players ever in December as well as our highest revenue quarter-to-date for Hearthstone.","Registered players for the game have now reached over 25 million, capping off a spectacular start for Hearthstone. It's gratifying for us to see how the global Blizzard community has responded to our first foray into a new genre as well as the free-to-play market and gaming on tablets. We'll keep working hard to build on last year's momentum with more content in 2015 as well as the upcoming Android phone and iPhone versions of the game.","We do have another free-to-play game in the pipeline with Heroes of the Storm, our online team brawler. This is a genre that's proven to be very popular in the online space in recent years. We're excited to put our unique spin on this genre in a game that stands out from the rest, with highly accessible plays and iconic Blizzard characters from the Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo universes.","Heroes of the Storm has recently hit some major development milestones including the start of closed beta in January, along with sales of the Founder's Pack, a digital bundle for $39.99 that gives player an array of heroes, skins and other content as well as instant access to the beta test. We're continuing to ramp up our infrastructure and game service capabilities, allowing us to open up the game to more of the 9 million players who have signed up for beta testing. Excitement around Heroes of the Storm continues to build as we're seeing more grassroots tournaments pop up and major eSports entities are already creating professional teams for the game.","Looking further ahead, we gave the world a glimpse of what's next for Blizzard at BlizzCon. We kicked off the show by unveiling Overwatch, a team-based first-person shooter featuring an amazing cast of characters of heroes and set in an all-new Blizzard game universe. The announcement trailer for Overwatch was a viral sensation on the Internet, while attendees and press alike raved about the game play after trying an early build on the BlizzCon show floor. In addition to Overwatch, we also showcased the final chapter in the StarCraft II trilogy, Legacy of the Void. This will be a standalone expansion, meaning anyone can jump right into the StarCraft II experience without needing to own the previous games. We expect beta testing for both Overwatch and Legacy of the Void to start later this year.","For a while now, we've been discussing the strong pipeline of Blizzard games. Gamers have long known us for World of Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo. Now with Hearthstone added to the mix and Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch soon to follow, we will have more games in more genres and on more platforms than ever before. As busy and successful as 2014 was, we're looking to build on that momentum this year and deliver even more excitement to players in 2015.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call over to Thomas.","Thomas Tippl","Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call to questions, I'll take a moment to summarize the 3 key takeaways from today's call.","First, from a financial perspective, 2014 was an excellent year for Activision Blizzard: we beat our plan, delivered double-digit top line growth, grew EPS by 50% to a new record and strengthened our balance sheet by generating $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and paying down debt. Second, from a strategic perspective, our investments into new franchises are paying off. We created 2 new tent-pole franchises with Destiny and Hearthstone that are profitable right out of the gate. Destiny and Hearthstone also have great comp and pipelines that we expect to contribute to our results every year in a significant way.","For perspective, only 1 year ago, 3 franchises generated the vast majority of our revenues and operating income. During 2014, we've expanded that to 6 franchises, and for 2015, we expect this number to grow to 10. Third, we have been, and will continue to reposition our investments priorities against fast-growing business model, platform and geographic opportunities that have proven, profitable scale. We're already leading in digital sales, including microtransactions, value-added services and full-game digital downloads. We have a strong pipeline of free-to-play games coming to market in 2015 with Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty Online. This also positions us well for the fast-growing geography, which is Asia, where free-to-play is the dominant business model. From a platform perspective, mobile and tablet have also moved up on our priority list, and we're excited about the success Hearthstone has had on tablets and look forward to the rollout on Android and iOS phones.","So in summary, while our outlook for 2015 is significantly impacted by adverse exchange rate movements, we expect profitable growth to resume in 2016 and beyond based on the continued expansion of our franchise portfolio, particularly into free-to-play in China and mobile, along with an anticipated return to growth in the console software market and continued growth in higher-margin digital revenues.","So now we'll take a few questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Our question on Hearthstone monetization. The game is already a big hit. We continue to be impressed with the size of Twitch audiences, suggesting basically off-the-charts engagement. We're wondering if you take the average Hearthstone player, could you give a sense for the trend of their in-game spending over time, especially as the recent expansion like Goblins and, I guess, Gnomes are launched? How should we be thinking about the expansion packs? Is that a new source of spikes at the beginning when we launch them?","Michael Morhaime","Thanks for the question. Well, we're definitely -- we've definitely been thrilled with the engagement levels of Hearthstone throughout the year. I think you're correct when you think about their spending behavior. They certainly start out building their decks, and then their engagement and spending patterns certainly follow the release of new content throughout the year. So and that is what we saw, and so I think that drove our record Hearthstone engagement and revenue quarter in the fourth quarter of the year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","Eric, you touched on this a little bit, but Call of Duty, still the #1 title on console. But clearly, the unit volumes are down year-on-year and down from the peak of where they had been. Can you talk about some of the drivers of that, was that -- is it game-specific, is it cycle-specific, is it the franchise actually weakening or as people fear? And what are the prospects for regrowing the franchise going forward?","Eric Hirshberg","Yes, I don't think it's franchise-oriented, and just to level set here, it was the #1 game for the sixth consecutive year in North American, and we're now well past $1 billion in sell-through. And as we've just announced, we're off to a great start with our DLC season on Advanced Warfare, which is up double digits both on Season Pass and on a la carte DLC sales and engagement is higher than it was a year ago. Also, Advanced Warfare is a great game. It was really well received by both critics and fans, and it created a lot of positive buzz for the franchise. And we attach at franchise high-levels to the next-gen consoles which I think is what matters most when we're looking towards the future. So I actually think the franchise ended the year in a great place, and we entered 2015 with a lot of momentum. 2014 was the height of the console transition. So I think to compare it to years when we were selling -- when Call of Duty was able to sell to a much larger and more stable installed base is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Our 2015 guidance on Call of Duty's new release is flat year-over-year, but we still have a fairly conservative planning assumption. We have Treyarch developing the game. We'll have a larger installed base of next-gen hardware to sell into, and we believe our Q4 new release can be one of our best games yet. So we think the future is bright.","Operator","We'll go next to Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First, as someone who has covered the company for a long time and worked with Kristin from the very beginning, I would like to echo the positive comments. She has set the bar pretty high for IR programs. My question is for Mike on the Blizzard side, thanks for the update on Heroes of the Storm. Wanted to just see if you could provide some color on maybe the timing of the release and what the feedback has been from the beta? The Founder's Pack, how is that done, et cetera? Just how should we think about kind of the revenue opportunity in say '15 and '16?","Michael Morhaime","Okay, thanks for the question. So at this point, we're at the closed beta phase. We entered closed beta last month in January. We're very pleased with the response from our beta testers. The feedback that we've been receiving has been very positive. We are going to continue increasing the invites and concurrency as we test out the infrastructure for our game and drive towards open beta. We don't have any dates to announce on that. I think that's going to really be determined by how the testing goes, but we're eager to get the game into the hands of as many people as possible and drive towards our official commercial launch.","Operator","We'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Co.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And I'll echo everyone's comments. Kristin, good luck and keep in touch. My question, though, I think, is for Eric. I guess looking back at the performance of Skylanders, the commentary was generally positive, although we certainly see more competition in the space. As the originator of this type of experience, how should we think about the ability of the Skylanders team to evolve the experience? And in particular, remain relevant with what's a fairly fickle audience base?","Eric Hirshberg","Well, that fairly fickle audience base has made Skylanders the #1 console game globally with kids for the fourth year in a row. So I think that our relevance remains very high and our momentum is strong with the audience. It's also very true and inarguable that we continue to see more and more competition entering the category. But we believe we have 3 important advantages in relation to that competition. One is what, I think, at this point needs to be seen as our proven ability to out-innovate competitors. Critics and fans have both acclaimed our recent titles to that end, and we believe that the most important reason we've been able to stay on top of the category is that we've had the best games in the category, and we plan to continue that trend in 2015. Number two is that we're not constrained by the limitations of existing intellectual property or characters or anyone else's release slate. We only have to answer one question each and every time we design a game, which is what do we think will be the most fun experience for our fans to have? And three, while there's more competition, I also think it's notable that we are able to grow our annual revenue per user this year through new game play innovation like the introduction of Traps, and we plan to continue to do similar things like that in the future.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Merwin with Barclays.","Christopher Merwin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Kristin, it's great to work with you and all the best in the future. So how did digital downloads trends on new-gen consoles in the 4Q as compared to last year? Are you seeing an uplift in downloads on new gen or is that happening on old gen also? And would you mind just telling us directionally how digital sales trended for Call of Duty this year versus last? And then Dennis, just a quick follow-up. You mentioned that the $0.08 drag on non-GAAP earnings this year, I think, was mostly from tax rate, but I also noticed that share count you're forecasting is up year-on-year, so just curious if that includes the impact of buybacks?","Dennis Durkin","Yes, just to be clear, the $0.08 does include our increased share count in our model of $0.01, and we don't have any buybacks included in that number. So to just sort of bring that point to roost. The second part -- or the first part of your question, though, on digital downloads, yes, obviously, very positive momentum in terms of digital download on consoles. In Q4 year-over-year, as the next-gen installed base grew, we did see a doubling effectively on Call of Duty in terms of our digital downloads year-over-year. So that's very, very nice. We're now seeing sort of mix percentages. We talked about high teens on the last call. It kind of remained in sort of the teams area in terms of total overall mix, and that'll sort of move a little bit throughout the year as you have different sort of retail pushes, et cetera. But overall, we've seen just great demand for digital on both next-gen systems as well as on past gen systems. So it's a pretty consistent trend that we're seeing.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Creutz with Cowen.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Eric, could you talk a little more about Call of Duty online. It has been now in open release for a month. So you have some idea, you mentioned that the anticipation of the game was very high. So I think that you must have a lot of players in the game. And then is there anything that we should be looking at as analysts to try and assess how the game is doing that you can think of? That would be helpful as well.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks. We think the game is going to be great and our partners at Tencent do, too. As I mentioned in my comments, the Baidu Index puts Call of Duty Online on par with the rollout of League of Legends in terms of consumer interest, which is a great start. It's been just over 3 weeks since we launched and we're still an open beta, so as I said, it's too early for us to share any financial metrics, but we're optimistic. In terms of 2015 guidance, we assume modest contributions from Call of Duty Online but that's simply because, even with the most successful free-to-play games in the market, they've taken time to build revenue to expand their audiences. So we feel fortunate that Tencent has the strongest track record in that market, and I think you can look to games like Crossfire or League of Legends to see how the early ramp up occurs for large successful games in the Chinese market. That's a ramp that takes time to build up, but one that is ultimately significant and worth it.","Operator","We'll next go to Drew Crum with Stifle.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","As it relates to Destiny, Eric, can you comment on your retail position exiting 2014? What does the channel inventory look like? And then talk about the puts and takes for the franchise when you compare '15 to '14 from a top and bottom line perspective?","Dennis Durkin","Okay, well, maybe I'll take that one actually, and maybe, Eric, if there's any follow-up commentary you want to have just on the content pipeline. This is Dennis. Obviously, we don't talk about specific channel levels by franchise, but overall, we're comfortable with the channel levels that we have across our various portfolio and ended the year in a very good position relative to that. I would make one comment relative to overall channel inventory levels that was the move to digital. I'd say retailers are managing their channel inventories very closely, so the overall channel is down versus previous years, and we expect this trend to continue as the transition to digital continues over the coming years. Relative to the puts and takes for Destiny and sort of comparing '14 and '15, obviously, last year was a major launch with Destiny 1 and we won't have a comparable launch this year, although we do have content, as I mentioned and Eric mentioned, in the back half of the year. On the flip side, though, on the cost side, there was significant amortization of Destiny's development costs that came through in 2014, that will not be in 2015. So even though the revenue will be down based on the new content pipeline and a smaller release, effectively, we do expect actual profits to be up for the franchise.","Eric Hirshberg","And the 2 things I would add, I think the 2 most important things to think about in relation to Destiny as we look forward now that the launch is behind us, first is just a record-breaking size of the launch and the amount of players we brought into the top of that funnel. And then the second is the remarkable ongoing engagement that we're seeing. That's obviously the combination you want as you strive to build a 10-year franchise. We have a massive audience and they're averaging over 3 hours of play per day. So both of those things speak to the fact that Destiny is a great game. As I mentioned, we have a second expansion pack on the way and a major content release coming in the fall and a very robust pipeline planned after that. Beyond that, whenever you have a large and highly engaged community, there are obviously opportunities for us to deliver a lot of different kinds of content that we think that player base would find valuable and appreciate and that's what we're planning on doing.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Wonder if you can talk a little bit about your cash and capital allocation. You got about 25% of your cash onshore. Is there -- what are your plans or how can you use some of the offshore cash maybe to pay down debt? Or what are your plans for some of that offshore cash? And then as you think about, you have -- you're paying down some of your debt, what's your long-term view of the debt? It was 7-year debt when you originally issued those notes. Is that something you want to keep paying down? Or just you want to -- do you want to sustain a certain amount of debt? And then last, as you think about the remaining Vivendi shares that could come to market, possibly your view of those shares as a possible buyback opportunity?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. Thanks for the question, Eric. We've obviously talked about capital allocation in the past, I think you see some of the priorities relative to that highlighted in the capital allocation choices we made today. In general, we're trying to balance the various needs of our stakeholders while maintaining flexibility over the long term to invest in the business and take advantage of opportunities that may arise and really strong cash flows and a strong balance sheet help us support that objective. We've said in the past we're very comfortable with sort of capital structure that we have today. We're continuing to pay down as we pointed out today with the $250 million buy down of our Term Loan B. We're in a net cash position when you sort of do the puts and takes of our debt versus our cash. We're very -- we feel like we're in a very flexible position and that allows us to make the capital allocation choices that we did today regarding the dividend and obviously the authorization of the buyback. The last part of your question I think was relating to Vivendi, we don't really have anything to announce relative to that, we don't know their intentions, we are in their window period that does open up, but you'd have to ask them about their intentions relative to that. And then, I guess, the first part of your question related to euro cash, and we do have a sizable, obviously, overseas cash balance that is, for our financial statement, permanently invested abroad, and we think that will be used to fund our international options and opportunities going forward, so that's our plan for that. So thanks, Eric, for your call.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Okay, I would like to thank everyone for their time and interest today. I'd like to thank Bobby and everyone for their super great comments, and all of you, it's been a great 15 years. So thank you, all.","Robert A.

In addition we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Amrita. And thank you for joining us today. This quarter we achieved record revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow, and over-performed our prior guidance. The size and engagement of our community remains strong. We continue to invest in both in-game growth opportunities, as well as adjacent opportunities, like consumer products, advertising, and esports. One of our big priorities is to unlock the full potential of professional esports by opening the sale of teams and media rights of our leagues. Over the years, we've become a leader in creating world class competitive experiences, sustainable franchises that engage hundreds of millions of people around the world, through gameplay competition and connecting players and communities. This success is driven by our ability to tap into the timeless power of communities, anchored through organized competition.","Throughout history, sports has helped bring communities together. City and country loyalties form the basis for spectator enthusiasm, generations of engaged audiences and traditions anchored in scheduled competitions. Until the 20th century though, sports like football, baseball and basketball were still hobbies for gifted amateurs. Then professional leagues emerged like the Premier League, the NFL, or the NBA. The value of sports in our everyday lives has grown exponentially, and so have the commercial opportunities that we see in sports. We actually believe the same opportunity to further professionalize esports now exists, and we think the impact can be as significant as the traditional sports we know and love.","The franchises we've built over the years deliver competitive experiences as enduring as traditional sports, but with unique strength and value for brands. Our players are digital natives competing in almost every country in the world. The esports audience includes some of the hardest to reach and most sought-after demographics for marketers and advertisers, with the share of millennials two to three times higher than any of the big four U.S. sports. We're incredibly excited to launch the Overwatch League later this year. We believe by celebrating and rewarding our players, and recognizing their accomplishments, our professional players will become the role model and inspired competitors of the 21st century. The competitions we're creating around the world will attract sponsors and advertisers resulting in broadcast revenues, licensing, sponsorship and ticket sales, and most importantly, amazing spectator experiences. Through MLG, we're building the first dedicated global channel for esports, the over the top ESPN of video games.","To put the Overwatch League opportunity in context, around 240 million people today watch approximately 7 billion hours of NFL content annually. This drives $12 billion in revenues including more than $6 billion in media rights revenues. The NBA today has roughly 175 million viewers watching around 2 billion hours total with more than $5 billion in revenues and a $1.8 billion of those from media rights. With hundreds of millions of people already watching esports and playing our games, over the long term our goal is to create opportunities that we believe could be of a similar scale. We're also going to combine delivery of our spectator content with unique advertising opportunities that includes the ability for advertisers to have better targeting and analytics, much more so than what you would see in traditional forms of broadcast advertising today. And with over 400 million MAUs and extremely high levels of engagement, our potential to generate meaningful advertising revenue is substantial. In particular, we believe our initiatives for advertising in King mobile games is a large and untapped opportunity and we're continuing to make progress with our testing and development of our ads platform, Ad King.","Our results this past quarter demonstrate our ability to execute successfully against the many opportunities for shareholder value creation we have and as we have done for 26 years.","And now Thomas will share the details on the quarter with you.","Thomas Tippl - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Bobby. We're off to a very strong start this year. We delivered record Q1 revenues of $1.7 billion and record digital revenues of $1.4 billion. We grew year-over-year, over-performed our guidance for the quarter, and are raising our guidance for the full year. Our results continue to be driven by focus and execution against our three strategic pillars. First, expanding our audiences, second deepening engagement, and third providing more opportunities for player investment.","Let's start with audience reach, which was 431 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had 41 million MAUs for the quarter, up 58% versus last year and relatively stable versus the prior quarter, despite no new full-game releases. Blizzard's fastest growing new IP ever, Overwatch, continues to grow from an MAU perspective, setting another high water mark this quarter. In less than a year since launch, Overwatch has 30 million registered players and has become Activision's eighth $1 billion franchise. Hearthstone continues to attract new players as well, reaching 70 million registered players life-to-date. MAUs also grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite no new content in Q1.","Activision had 48 million MAUs for the quarter, down year-over-year due to weakness in last holiday's Infinite Warfare release as discussed on our Q4 call. However, Call of Duty continues to have a large and active community of players across Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III. And we expect the community to grow with the next game in the series, Call of Duty: World War II, releasing November 3.","When Activision greenlit this game more than 2.5 years ago, the team knew it was time to return the franchise to its roots, and fans are already sharing their excitement for Call of Duty: World War II. Activision revealed the game at a global live stream from London last week, which became the most watched live stream in Call of Duty history, and the reveal trailer has gone on to become the most liked trailer in Call of Duty history, and became the fastest video to reach 10 million views in Call of Duty history, which it did in one day. Additionally, though it's still very early, pre-orders are off to a very strong start. Call of Duty: World War II will deliver the gritty authentic cinematic experience, which Call of Duty is known for.","Activision along with its partners at Bungie also recently revealed the much anticipated Destiny 2, which is set for release on September 8. Destiny was the biggest new video game franchise launch of all time when it was released, and early leading indicators including pre-orders for Destiny 2 are very strong as well. The team is taking great care in designing the game to appeal to existing and new fans, including PC players for the first time. Activision is also localizing the game for more markets, which should enable us to reach new audiences. And at launch, we're offering an expansion pass for Destiny 2, containing two future expansions, along with a continuous calendar of other events. Encouragingly, the SKUs that contain the expansion pass have attracted the majority of pre-orders so far. We believe the combination of a great game, the new opportunity to reach PC players, and a robust content plan post-launch highlight the opportunity ahead. We look forward to sharing more about both Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II in the months ahead.","Turning to our next strategic pillar, our compelling games, deep gameplay and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also deep engagement with about 40 billion hours of gameplay over the past 12 months. Blizzard continues to see strong engagement from its players with time spent increasing by a double digit percentage year-over-year to a new Q1 record. Overwatch again had strong engagement this quarter thanks in part to the Lunar New Year event, which like the three seasonal events before it, drove record engagement in the game. Overwatch's latest seasonal event released on April 11. This event named Uprising included a player versus environment game mode, which drew record hours of player engagement, demonstrating that Overwatch can appeal to players beyond player versus player competition.","In April, Blizzard also launched Heroes of the Storm 2.0, with a more powerful progression system, reward pack loot chests, and new battleground, and more compelling heroes, all of which brought players back into the game. Blizzard's strategy to release content and feature updates more regularly in World of Warcraft has been paying off with time spent up year-over-year, and with overall performance ahead of the prior expansion. At the end of the quarter, Blizzard released the game's second major patch since Legion came out with more content to come later this year. To round out the terrific performance of Blizzard's games, Hearthstone set a new all-time record in daily active users in April with the release of the new expansion, Journey to Un'goro.","King's MAUs were down slightly versus prior quarter, but community engagement trends continue to set new highs with an increase in total playtime versus prior quarter. Time spent by daily active user is now a record 35 minutes. King also had the highest DAU to MAU ratio since 2013, with stability in DAUs versus the prior quarter. This performance shows that King's focus on live ops and new content for core franchises continues to keep our large and loyal audience engaged. And this bodes well for King's biggest growth opportunity, advertising.","Esports is an important and growing engagement driver for our community, and there were many highlights this quarter. Activision held Call of Duty World League events in Atlanta, Dallas, London, Paris, and Sydney, and Blizzard kicked off the StarCraft II World Championship Series, Hearthstone Championship Tour, and Heroes of the Storm Global Championship with major international events, along with the third Heroes of the Dorm college tournament in Las Vegas. In addition, the Overwatch APEX League completed its second season in Korea and this year's Overwatch World Cup was announced as part of a busy year of Overwatch esports, as Blizzard gears up for the Overwatch League. And we have more to come down the road, including the recently announced CWL Championship. This is Call of Duty's biggest competitive event of the year, and will be held in August in Orlando with 32 teams from around the world competing for a prize pool of $1.5 million as part of the largest CWL season long prize pool to-date of $4 million.","Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Blizzard saw an increase in total in-game purchases by almost 30% year-over-year, primarily driven by Overwatch and World of Warcraft, highlighting once again the virtuous cycle of engagement leading to more player investment, all of which starts with great new content. Later this month, Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III fans will be getting a new content offering called Zombies Chronicles, a remastered collection of the franchise's most beloved zombies content. This is our most significant new content update yet in the second year following a Call of Duty release as we now have better player engagement opportunities than we've ever had with our catalog games.","King not only increased engagement, but also increased player investment this quarter. Bookings per paying user rose for the 7th quarter in a row to a new record. King continues to have two of the top ten grossing games in the U.S. for the 14th quarter in a row, and importantly the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with mobile bookings growing versus prior quarter. King has a number of projects in development, including a promising new publishing partnership with PlayStudios in the social casino segment, slated for later this year. This is an attractive mobile gaming genre and will allow us to provide great content for our existing player base, as well as attract new players to the King network.","As we discussed last quarter, we also have a number of mobile incubation projects underway across the company, many of which are based on our proven IP. Since King became part of the Activision Blizzard family last year, we've been looking at ways to work together to create even more great gaming experiences for our large player network. Last month, we announced that King and Activision are partnering on the creation of a Call of Duty mobile game, and we're excited about the potential of bringing these two great teams together.","In summary, we are off to a terrific start in 2017, with continued success keeping our large audiences engaged across a growing portfolio and on a variety of platforms. We are also pleased with the early momentum we are seeing for Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II and the continued progress on new growth opportunities, like advertising, esports and consumer products. We are excited about our prospects and stay tuned for further updates in the weeks and months ahead.","Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail.","Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Thomas. Today I will review our better than expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. Once again, we outperformed our guidance thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered record Q1 revenues, digital revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow.","To review the quarter, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. At an aggregate level, combined segment operating income was up 41% year-over-year on an as reported basis. Operating income also grew on a pro forma basis, when including a full quarter of King last year. This is despite expected Call of Duty headwinds and shows the strength and broad diversity of our portfolio. As anticipated, Activision Publishing's Q1 results were down due to lower in-game digital sales. As mentioned on our Q4 call, we expect Activision to have a back-end loaded year with the two exciting releases in the second half of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II.","King's relatively stable daily player base and continued growth in per-player engagement and player investment led to sequential revenue growth of 9% and an increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter. Blizzard's revenue grew 50% year-over-year, while operating income nearly doubled driven primarily by the success of Overwatch as well as strong continued engagement in World of Warcraft. So the strong 2016 tailwinds for the Blizzard business continue into 2017.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter we generated record Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.73 billion, $176 million above our February guidance, and $271 million or 19% above Q1 last year. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $530 million for the quarter. We generated record GAAP EPS of $0.56 and record non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 in Q1, which was $0.21 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.41. The over-performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by a combination of business over-performance as well as timing of expenses. Our digital revenues once again grew to a Q1 record, $1.4 billion, up 50% versus last year. The strong digital performance led not only to year-over-year operating margin expansion, but also strong cash flow generation. We delivered record Q1 operating cash flow of $411 million, up 22% year-over-year.","From a balance sheet perspective, we paid down $500 million of debt in Q1, ending the quarter with $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, with about $1.3 billion held domestically. And next week on May 10 we plan to pay a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, a 15% increase over 2016, to shareholders of record from the close of business on March 30, 2017.","Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q2. Our Q2 slate includes one of Blizzard's busiest stretches of in-game content releases, including momentum from the March 28 World of Warcraft content update; a new Hearthstone expansion, Journey to Un'goro; the Overwatch Uprising event; and the Heroes of the Storm 2.0 launch with more content to come in the upcoming months. King will continue to drive live ops across its portfolio, albeit with some typical seasonality expected in Q2.","Activision expects to release Call of Duty's second map pack as well as a free update in Destiny. In addition, they will launch new zombies content for Black Ops III, as well as new content and updates across the portfolio to keep players engaged while at the same time beginning the ramp in sales and marketing spend for our major releases later this year.","For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, including the net recognition of GAAP deferred revenues of $225 million, product cost of 23%, and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $37 million, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 764 million, and EPS of $0.15.","For Q2 on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs of 23%, and operating expenses of 48%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $36 million, tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38, which includes the net recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.11. Just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.38 and remove the net recognition of deferrals for $0.11.","Now to our 2017 full year outlook. Though it is still early in the year and we have a lot left to deliver, including our major launches in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook. Also, as we mentioned on our last call, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.1 billion including GAAP deferrals of $230 million, product cost of 22%, and operating expenses of 62%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $157 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.88, up $0.16 versus our previous guidance.","For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis as redefined, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80, up $0.10 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.08. If you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.80 and add the impact of deferrals, or $0.08.","So in summary, 2017 is off to a very strong start. Our record performance and cash flow generation speak to the strong year-round trends in our core business. We have a lot left to deliver later this year, but we are seeing some promising early data points on our two major launches ahead with Call of Duty and Destiny. Our strong owned IP portfolio combined with promising emerging business opportunities like esports, advertising and consumer products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. And as always, with so many great opportunities ahead of us, we remain focused on operational excellence, capital discipline and long term shareholder value creation.","Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, and Riccardo as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, we'll take a question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes, so first congratulations on the quarter, and thank you for taking my question. So I was just wondering if you could provide more detail on the Call of Duty: World War II release this November, and maybe specifically what you have planned to bring more players into the game. Thanks.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, thanks, Tim. Maybe the easiest way to answer the question is to go a little deeper into the data that Thomas started to share on our prepared remarks. Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start. But we also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game and we're off to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and also now has the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of the live stream. That's both for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the livestream also was extremely positively received, with a 95% like to dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is the \u2013 that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we \u2013 was an issue last year, has virtually evaporated at about 0.2% at reveal. So, I think, we're going to have a great game. And I think we have the right game at the right time. Obviously there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stop there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that. And for context, the other time was Black Ops III. So obviously we have a lot of confidence in what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously, but we're off to a strong start. And while we're obviously only talking today about Call of Duty: World War II, I have the benefit of knowing what we have in the pipeline, and I think that we \u2013 I've got a lot of confidence that our fans are going to be excited to play all the games that we've got cooking up for them over the next several years.","Operator","And this time we'll take a question from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. My question for Bobby or Mike around Overwatch, and you must be encouraged by the pace of growth with the user base. I'm wondering just how large of a market opportunity you think there is for this game, how you plan on maintaining that pace of growth, and on a related note if you could provide an update on the progress of the Overwatch League, including timing of league sales and kick off of the league. Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Colin. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. So right now we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've seen new players come into the game when we release new types of gameplay through our seasonal events. And we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that.","We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia as well as our strong presence on both PC and Console. But we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out of game linear media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful in fueling passion for the game's lore. And we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing esports community is really strong and it's growing. The Overwatch League is poised to accelerate that even more. So we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months and I can turn it over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is going.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Yeah, as far as the team selling process is concerned, Colin, if you look back at the history of when we started this, it was really building a structure that would allow us to celebrate, recognize, and reward our players, and that was our principal priority. What we've come to realize is there's a big commercial opportunity potentially as well. So we've got a great team assembled with people from places like ESPN, Fox Sports, the NFL, the NBA. We've been out meeting with prospective team owners, both endemic teams as well as professional sports team owners, and the reception has been terrific. We'll be announcing our key city sometime later this year and give a little bit more detail into what the play schedule will be. But not for another few months.","Operator","Let us now move to San Phan with Mizuho.","San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. This question is for Riccardo. Can you tell us a bit more about King engagement, what you're focused on at this point? And how you think by driving that business, you're growing engagement.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi Phan. It is Riccardo. So engagement has always been and continues to be a key priority for the company. And as you've seen from what Thomas was saying earlier, we have very positive trends and we are very happy about these positive trends. The average time played per player in last quarter was around 35 minutes per day. And this has been an increase both towards the last quarter and also versus the same quarter of the previous year. So, great results. And it's also great result that create engagement, it translates into how you're monetization. And we have seen here that bookings per pay year have gone up for the seventh consecutive quarter. So we have reached a new record level.","Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new fresh content in the live games, and we do \u2013 we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific timeframe. And this makes it particularly attractive. And what we also do then, we also release features, which are permanent. So that they are impacting the gameplay for the long term. And both of those \u2013 the content releases are in the live games. What we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross promoting players from one game to the next game. And by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement, not only in the single game but at network level.","And then of course we release new games and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year. And the launch went very well. We are very pleased with the results of the launch, and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game. And as you have heard earlier, Thomas, we have now \u2013 we're also entering a new genre of games with the partnership with PlayStudios, which will go live towards the ends of the year.","San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Evan Wingren with Pacific Crest Securities.","Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks. So given Blizzard's slate this year, with less full games being released, just curious how you think about the content to help keep the community engaged throughout the year and how you think about the monetization of that engagement?","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Evan, this is Mike. So, yeah, this year for Blizzard represents a new type of pipeline, one that's not necessarily based on full game launches, but instead on delivering new content updates for our games. This quarter, we have meaningful new content for every franchise in our portfolio. In fact, a few weeks ago we set a new DAU record on the back of these new content updates. This reflects the evolution of our business from focusing primarily on full game releases to also providing a consistent stream of content for our players. Even without any full game launches this year, we're continuing to add to the depths of our games to serve a very highly engaged community with more content across our portfolio than we ever have before.","Operator","At this time we'll move to Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks, good afternoon. Looks like King has posted some developer job openings for Call of Duty mobile game. Can you provide us with any more detail on the game and your plans with that going forward?","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure, I'll start. Riccardo, then maybe you can jump in. So, yeah, Thomas mentioned King and Activision are teaming up to build a Call of Duty mobile game from the ground up. And the goal is to take a brand that tens of millions of people know and love and reinterpret it in a way that is appealing to the mass mobile audience. And we think it's a big opportunity. With King's experience making massively accessible and engaging games for that platform, and Activision's experience building one of the most enduring and appealing and engaging gaming franchises ever, we think we have the right combination of skills to pull it off. But obviously it's very early days. But that's the goal. Riccardo?","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Mike. So I believe if I may I will add a couple things to what Eric just said. First of all, and most importantly, and I'm talking here for the entire King's team. I'm super excited about this incredible opportunity, and to work together with the incredible team at Activision Publishing. One of the things which really excited us when we joined the Activision Blizzard family was the strength of the team on one side and the incredible quality and depth of their portfolio of games. And now we have the opportunity to work together on one of the jewels in this portfolio. So, this is super exciting.","Of course, as Eric was saying, it's still early days. We are just at the beginning of this process and of the development, and it will take many iterations, as we know well, to create a game of incredible quality. But we are super focused on it. We put amazing people on this task. The target is to develop a game of broad appeal and to combine in doing it the experience of King of creating mobile games of broad appeal with the great experience in the genre and in the shooter genre of Activision Publishing and the experience of creating a franchise which has been around for a very long time. And so I believe that this is a really significant future opportunity, and I'm very excited to work together.","Operator","We'll now move to Doug Creutz with Cowen.","Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yeah, I wonder if you could give as much update as you can on when you expect to rollout advertising to the King user base, and maybe talk about what some of the gating items are to do that? Thank you.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Doug. So advertising is still in beta. In Q1 of this year, we've been doing further testing. We've built the internal capabilities, and we've built the team and are continuing to build the team. Currently, we are testing in seven titles, including some of our largest titles, with Candy, Candy Soda, and Farm Heroes. And we're testing different ad formats to ensure that we have the best possible player experience and also to ensure that we have the best possible return for our advertisers. We're seeing that in the market there's incredible demand for high quality mobile video ad symmetry, and we continue to be very excited about this opportunity, because we think we are in a very strong position both because of the size of the network and as you've heard before, because of the engagement of our players. So as we said earlier this year in \u2013 at our last earnings call in February, we expect to become profitable with this business line, with advertising this year, and to scale up the business in 2018.","Operator","Our final question today will be from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. A question on Destiny. Can you just talk a little bit about your expectations for Destiny in the new guidance given the dual platform, console and PC release? And then talk a little more about the digital and the MTX innovation you see coming with the title and what type of contribution you expect in that? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Well, the community's reception to the reveal was obviously awesome. And after four weeks, Destiny 2 pre-orders are tracking amongst the top in Activision Publishing's history. So the most important thing for this franchise beyond delivering a great game, which Destiny 2 is definitely going to do, as we talked about in the past, is getting the content pipeline right. Destiny's engagement has been the best in Activision's history. And we now have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to keep up with demand with that steady stream of great content to sort of keep pace with our player's engagement post the release of Destiny 2.","So as you know from our past comments on previous calls on \u2013 with Destiny 2's content, we're coupling Bungie's great visionary leadership with multiple AAA developers that have a proven track record here at Activision to help us make sure that we have just one great piece of new content after another to keep the community engaged. And that's the most important answer to the second part of your question. We've shown that when we have great engagement, great business follows. So with respect to PC, which you asked about, we're committed to delivering meaningful features that are bespoke for the PC community and I'm really excited about what we have to show for them. But I'm going to leave the details of those for our gameplay premiere event which is happening on May 18. And we'll have some additional, obviously, exciting announcements on the game overall at that time as well.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Brian, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We'll look forward to seeing many of you at E3 or on our earnings call this summer.

As indicated in this slide that is showing, a number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.","Such factors include, without limitation, sales levels; current macroeconomic and industry conditions; increasing concentration of titles; shifts in consumer spending trends; our ability to predict consumer preferences among competing genres and hardware platforms; maintenance of key relationships, including the ability to attract, retain and develop key personnel and developers that can create high-quality hit titles; the seasonal and cyclical nature of our industry; changing business models, including digital delivery of content, competition, including from used games; possible declines in prices, product returns, price protection, product delays, adoption rate and availability of new hardware and related software; rapid changes in technology and industry standards; litigation and associated costs; protection of proprietary rights; counterparty risks; economic, financial and political conditions and policies; foreign exchange and tax rates; and potential changes associated with geographic expansion.","These important factors and other factors that potentially could affect the company's financial results are described in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2011, and in the company's other SEC filings. The company may change its intentions, beliefs or expectations made at any time and without notice based upon any changes in such factors in the company's assumptions or otherwise.","The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available in the company as of the date of this presentation and, while we believe them to be true, may ultimately prove to be incorrect. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 7, 2012, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.","I'd like to note that certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games, expenses related to stock-based compensation, expenses related to restructuring, the amortization of intangibles and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill and the associated tax benefits. Please refer to our earnings release which is posted at www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation.","There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a 12-quarter financial overview, highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results on a one-page summary sheet.","And now I'd like introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and thank you for joining us today. 2012 is on track to be another record year for Activision Blizzard. For the first 9 months of 2012, we achieved new records for non-GAAP revenues, operating income and earnings per share. And for 3 consecutive years, we\u2019ve produced over $1 billion of operating cash flow for the trailing 12-month period ending September 30.","We continue to strengthen our franchises and expand our portfolio of leading interactive brands. Year-to-date, Diablo III is the top-selling game overall based on an estimated digital and retail sales in North America and Europe. Diablo III has already sold an excess of 10 million copies, proving once again that investing in key talent and our top franchise is worth the wait.","Our newest intellectual property, Skylanders, is the top-selling console and handheld game at retail in North America and Europe and has already generated life-to-date revenues in excess of $500 million. Call of Duty is one of the world's most popular entertainment franchises and continues to set records for online engagement. And World of Warcraft remains the most successful massively multiplayer online game ever created. Our franchises and the extraordinarily talented Activision Blizzard employees around the world who oversee them drove our record results for the first 9 months, and their efforts and commitments to excellence will likely result in another year of record results for all of 2012.","Based on our strong execution year to date and increased visibility of markets and products in the fourth quarter, we are raising our 2012 outlook and expect to deliver increased non-GAAP revenues year-over-year and double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for the third consecutive year.","We also continue to strengthen our competitive position by doing what we do best, staying focused on driving our business by prioritizing our biggest opportunities and not getting distracted by initiatives unlikely to result in the creation of great interactive entertainment and superior shareholder returns.","Our track record of identifying the largest opportunities, aligning our talented employees against those opportunities and building leading franchises, is unrivaled in our industry. While we have a promising pipeline of great games based on proven franchises, as well as exciting new projects like our collaboration with Bungie, we recognize that duplicating this year's success will be difficult. Nevertheless, we'll remain focused on delivering the very best games, ensuring that our company is the very best place to work, providing an environment that fosters the commitment to excellence we have become well-known for and, of course, over the long term, providing superior returns to our shareholders.","As we look to calendar 2013, we remain cautious in light of a challenging worldwide macroeconomic environment, the ongoing console transition and difficult year-over-year comparables as a result of Blizzard's record-shattering success with Diablo III in 2012.","Over the past 20 years, we and our stakeholders have benefited greatly from focus, discipline and an unyielding commitment to excellence, coupled with a long-term view of value creation. We'll continue to acknowledge and honor the dedication and hard work of our incredibly talented employees, the continued enthusiasm of our audiences and the patience and support of our shareholders as we maintain our position as the world's leading interactive entertainment company.","And now I'd like to pass the phone over to Dennis, who will take you through the results of the quarter and balance of the year.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will begin with a recap of our better-than-expected third quarter and year-to-date results. I'll then cover our increased outlook for 2012 and provide some initial comments on 2013.","Starting with our results. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, strong consumer demand for our premium content and services drove better-than-expected and record results, with revenues of $841 million, digital revenues of $430 million and EPS of $0.20. For the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis, revenues increased 20% versus the prior year to $751 million. Digital revenues set a third quarter record at $427 million, guiding an operating margin increase of 690 basis points, while EPS more than doubled over the prior year to a record $0.15.","Turning to specific P&L items, please note all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For the quarter, GAAP product costs were 24%, and GAAP operating expenses were 49%, below our outlook due mainly to revenue outperformance. Our GAAP tax rate was near 0 due to a one-time benefit from a discrete item of $46 million, or $0.04, resulting from the closure of a premerger IRS audit related to net operating losses from Vivendi Games.","Non-GAAP product costs were 26%, and operating expenses were 53%, below our outlook also due mainly to revenue outperformance. Our non-GAAP tax rate was also near 0 due to the one-time discrete item I just mentioned.","For the first 9 months of the year, strong retail and digital sales of our 4 mega franchises, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Call of Duty and Skylanders, drove new records for non-GAAP revenues, operating margin and EPS. In terms of the balance sheet, on September 30, we had no debt and $3.4 billion in cash and investments, or approximately $2.85 per fully diluted share.","For the trailing 12 months ending September, our operating cash flow was over $1.2 billion and after capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.15 billion, a level that far exceeds other independent interactive entertainment companies, and this represents our third consecutive year of generating operating cash flow and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion for the trailing 12 months, and that's after making significant investments in our strong multiyear pipeline and back end infrastructure.","Our ability to not only invest but also generate high returns on investment is what continues to set us apart from most of our competition. As we laid out at the beginning of the year, we continue to focus on driving execution against the following objectives in 2012: First, to drive growth at Blizzard. Second, to focus on Black Ops II and expand and scale the Skylanders franchise at Activision Publishing; and third, to continue expanding our overall operating margin. Our strong execution against each of our objectives to date positions us for another year of record non-GAAP margins and EPS growth in 2012.","Turning to our 2012 full year outlook. We still have a lot of games to sell between now and the end of the year, but thanks to our strong performance for the first 3 quarters, the great product quality we are seeing on recently released and upcoming launches and the increased visibility we have into Q4, we're raising our outlook again and expect, on a GAAP basis, net revenues of $4.57 billion. We expect product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect a full year tax rate of 20%, a diluted share count of about 1.145 billion shares and GAAP EPS of $0.88. We expect non-GAAP net revenues of $4.8 billion, up 7% versus the prior year. We expect non-GAAP product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 39%, resulting in a new full year record operating margin of 33%, a 300-basis-point improvement over the prior year record.","We expect a tax rate of 22% and a diluted share count of 1.145 billion. We now expect record non-GAAP EPS of $1.10, an 18% increase over the prior year. Importantly, since our merger in 2008, we expect to deliver a non-GAAP compound annual EPS growth rate of 17%.","Moving to the December quarter on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.48 billion, product costs of 30% and operating expenses of 50%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 26% and EPS of $0.19.","For the December quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $2.4 billion, product costs of 28% and operating expenses of 28%. During the quarter, we expect to generate over $1 billion of non-GAAP operating income, a first for the company. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% and the same share count as the full year. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.70, again, a new record.","In summary, Activision Blizzard produced another great financial quarter with record EPS and strong cash flow, driven by strong product performance and engagement. We are raising our full year 2012 non-GAAP EPS outlook by $0.11 based on our better-than-expected results and on increased visibility for the remainder of the year.","Looking to 2013, we will continue focusing on the key pillars that have driven our past success, notably, driving innovation and quality in our slate, building upon our strength in retail and digital and keeping a relentless focus on cost containment. And although it's too early to talk about 2013 in detail, until we finish the year and complete our bottoms up annual operating plan, I can comment on a couple of things we benefited from in 2012 that are not likely to be repeated in 2013. Notably, in 2012, we benefited from the extraordinary success of Blizzard's high-margin record-shattering Diablo III and from a lower tax rate due mainly to a one-time discrete item. Together, these 2 items alone are expected to account for more than $0.25 of our 2012 non-GAAP EPS.","In addition, notwithstanding these financial items, there are always other macroeconomic and industry challenges, particularly as we head into the ongoing console transition that Bobby mentioned. That said, we are incredibly excited about our current product and business momentum, our product pipeline for both Activision Publishing and Blizzard Entertainment and our ability to increase profitability and cash flow over the long term. We look forward to sharing the results of our 2012 holiday, as well as the specifics of our annual operating plan for 2013 with you on our next call in early February.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Hirshberg, who will discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll briefly touch on the macro industry trends we're seeing and then get into our recent performance and our blockbuster Q4 launches.","The retail trends that we've seen over the past few years are continuing this year with the top 5 games in North America and Europe, growing 15%, including toys and accessories. However, this growth has come at the expense of the rest of the industry. While challenging, these trends play to our strengths, given our laser-focus on our largest and best franchise opportunities, and our performance this year so far continues to validate that strategy. So let's get into it.","Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, both of which were launched in 2011, were top 5 games in North America and Europe for the first 9 months of 2012. Additionally, Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was the #1 bestselling retail video game franchise across North America and Europe, including toys and accessories, and it's also become the #1 selling action figure line. In less than 1 year, Skylanders have become one of the world's most popular kids brands and is on track to become another billion-dollar franchise for the company.","And in Q4, we expect to increase our momentum on both Skylanders and Call of Duty franchises with our 2 biggest launches of the year. On October 17, we launched Skylanders Giants. Unlike last year, when we were facing the daunting challenge of launching new IP and, in fact, a new genre, this year we launched Skylanders Giants with the momentum solidly on our side. The game shipped with high brand awareness and more than a 50% larger retail presence than last year. In North America alone, Giants has over 100,000 linear feet of shelf space in more than 10,000 interactive displays worldwide, representing one of the biggest in-store presences of any video game.","We've also signed more than 100 licensing partnerships, which were chosen to increase both the brand's presence and its stature throughout the store. Our team at Toys for Bob has delivered another amazing game, and I want to thank them for all of their hard work, which is exceeded only by the breadth of their imaginations. Response from both critics and kids around the world has been extremely positive.","While it's far too early to share anything conclusive, we have a larger assortment of new toys, a significantly expanded retail presence and bigger marketing programs. We're very pleased with the game's early results, and we are tracking well ahead of where we were this time last year. We've also been pleased to see continued demand for Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure, even after the launch of Giants. We look forward to sharing more details with you in the future.","Now to Call of Duty, one of the largest franchises in all of entertainment. Recently, Forbes published its brand loyalty leaders list for 2012 and Call of Duty was ranked seventh, above the likes of such mega brands as Facebook, Google, Starbucks and Nike. And on November 13, we plan to further strengthen the brand with the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Developed by our team at Treyarch, the game has the potential to be biggest selling game of all time, to passing Call of Duty: Black Ops. I want to thank the team at Treyarch for all of their hard work and remarkable creativity in delivering this title.","Black Ops II had several meaningful innovations and firsts for the franchise. One key innovation has been the decision to take Call of Duty into the near future, which has opened up many new play mechanics, new weapons and new story opportunities. We believe Black Ops II is a shining example of keeping the Call of Duty franchise fresh, exciting and engaging, while still staying true to its core appeal.","And the buzz to date has been tremendous. YouTube views are nearly double those for MW3, Facebook engagement is up more than 150% and the Black Ops II multiplayer reveal from GamesCom became the largest live stream event in Xbox LIVE's history. And the Nielsen's first choice survey, which measures both unaided awareness and purchase intent, Call of Duty: Black Ops II tops the list and is at an all-time high for the franchise.","Looking to the launch, we're working incredibly hard with all of our partners around the world to make Call of Duty the biggest entertainment launch of all time for the fourth consecutive years. Pre-ops for Black Ops II continued to track ahead of Modern Warfare 3, which is no small feat given that MW3\u2019s was the most successful preorder program of all time.","Now I want to spend a moment talking about the recent announcements we made regarding Call of Duty Elite. We\u2019ve decided to make all of the player servers within Call of Duty Elite free for all Black Ops II players. While we're very proud of the unprecedented 2.4 million plus premium subscribers we were able to attract in under a year, we've concluded that Elite is more valuable as an engagement driving tool than as a premium service. Players who take advantage of Elite services play both longer and more frequently than those who don't. And a more engaged player is significantly more likely to purchase DLC, more likely to provide positive word of mouth and more likely to purchase our next game. If we've learned one thing, it's that Call of Duty is at its best when our community is united. So we think our recent decision is a true win-win, a win for our players and a win for our business.","And for players who still want to buy all of our DLC at a discount, we're introducing the Black Ops II season pass. Or players can still choose to purchase map packs \u00e0 la carte. So with these decisions, we feel we retained the best elements of Elite and taken no choices away from our players, while putting in place a model that's positioned to increase our digital revenue. While we're very excited about the upcoming launch of Black Ops II and all the consumer indicators are pointing in the right direction, there are always risks when trying to grow a brand that is already performing at record-setting levels. So while we're optimistic, we're still planning prudently. We look forward to sharing details about our successes with you over the weeks ahead.","Looking beyond 2012, as Bobby referenced, our pipeline is very strong. We expect to continue executing our winning formula on Call of Duty, delivering meaningful innovations, while also investing to further establish Call of Duty as one of the premiere brands in all of entertainment. We're also planning to expand Call of Duty's reach into Asia with our free-to-play game, Call of Duty Online. We also expect to grow the Skylanders franchise, and the new products already in development represent some of the most innovative we've ever had. On the new IP front, the action genre is one of the largest in video games, and we expect to increase our share through our ambitious partnership with Bungie. Between Bungie's track record of both creative and commercial success and Activision's consistent ability to build powerful global brands, we're gearing up for a potent partnership.","With regard to mobile and tablet gaming, we've taken a prudent \u201cbuild it, don't buy it\u201d approach. Today, mobile and tablet gaming are an exciting way to broaden our franchises but are not yet financially meaningful. We expect that over time this business will grow in scale and profitability.","So in summary, we're delivering innovation and executional excellence, while making focused investments in future opportunities. We also expect to generate the highest operating income and operating margin in Activision Publishing's history, which shows that our strategy of focusing our time, investment and creativity against our highest potential opportunities is working.","I'm looking forward to updating you on our holiday performance and our 2013 initiatives on our next call. And now I'll turn it over to Mike Morhaime, who will give you an update on Blizzard Entertainment.","Michael Morhaime","Thanks, Eric. The third quarter for Blizzard was a very successful one, thanks in large part to the launch of Mists of Pandaria at the end of September. As of the first week, more than 2.7 million copies sold through, and subscribership had grown to over 10 million at the end of the quarter. We also launched the game in China just one week after the other regions, which as far as we are aware, is the first time any game has officially released in China as part of a global launch. Overall, it was a successful launch, and we were very pleased with the reaction from players and critics.","The team worked hard to create a good variety of deeply engaged content for a wide range of players. The challenge mode and the new raids had been very appealing for hard-core players, while our other new features, such as the pet battle system, have been popular with players across the board. This breadth of new content, combined with a vast amount of existing content in World of Warcraft, has resulted in a game that has a lot to offer for veterans as well as newcomers to online gaming.","We're looking forward to maintaining engagement by providing more frequent content updates. The first major update to Mists of Pandaria is already in public testing, with additional updates to follow. We have other initiatives planned for the holiday season that we hope will maintain momentum from the launch and continue growth in the community.","Moving on to Diablo III. The game continued to sell very well in the quarter, riding the momentum from its record-breaking launch in May. We've updated the game several times to add new features, and these changes have been received well by the community.","Next on the slate for Blizzard will be Heart of the Swarm, the first expansion to StarCraft II. With 6 million copies of Wings of Liberty sold to date, we have a large community of players eagerly awaiting the next installment of StarCraft. Beta testing for Heart of the Swarm is well underway, and the development team has been collecting great feedback from the community. Just last week, we made a major content update to the beta in order to test some important community features, which have been well-received by players. These features are designed to improve the social aspect, as well as the overall user experience for StarCraft players. We're working hard towards a first half 2013 launch for Heart of the Swarm.","We plan on closing out 2012 with one more major initiative, our Battle.net World Championship event, which will take place on November 17 and 18 in Shanghai, China. This event is the culmination of months of intense eSports competitions, involving dozens of online tournaments and live events across 5 continents. The global finals will be very much like a World Cup of eSports with more than 60 top pro gamers in StarCraft II and World of Warcraft competing at the event. The sold out Battle.net World Championship will be broadcast online to a global audience. Live streams and information about the tournament can be found at www.battle.net\/bwc.","In closing, we're very pleased with the success of Mists of Pandaria, and Diablo III continues to be a top seller on the PC charts. Heart of the Swarm is well on its way, and we have other exciting projects in the pipeline. BlizzCon will be returning next year as well, adding to what will be a busy 2013 for Blizzard. We continue to build on our infrastructure for long-term growth and remain focused on creating high-quality content for all of our players around the world.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Okay, operator, we will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First will be Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I realize there's not a ton that you can really say about the next gen consoles, but can you give us a flavor for kind of whether some of your key titles, Call of Duty, et cetera, are bumping up against limitations of the current hardware? In other words, will a more powerful processor and whatever else is incorporated in the new consoles be materially beneficial to a title like that?","Robert A. Kotick","Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. There's really nothing that we can say about next generation hardware.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, maybe quickly then on Skylanders. I'm guessing you don't want to announce a kind of unit number right now, but is there any indication on that front that you can give us for how that's tracking? Secondly, you mentioned on Call of Duty that pre-orders are up. We're seeing some kind of conflicting data points there with some third-party sources saying that pre-orders are down. So just anything that you can say to kind of reconcile what's out there and what you may be seeing?","Eric Hirshberg","I'll start with your second question first. I can confidently say that my comments were accurate and the pre-orders are in fact tracking ahead of MW3 for Black Ops II, so I don't know what data you're receiving, but that's the case. On Skylanders, as I said, we're tracking well ahead, and we have a situation where we've got the brand momentum behind us, we've got higher awareness, a better assortment of toys, and the wind's at our back. So we can't provide more detail than that at this point, but we're feeling good.","Operator","And moving on, our next question comes from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","Two questions, if I might. First, for Eric, I wonder if you could comment on your thoughts around the Wii U, specifically for Call of Duty, maybe not -- that's not something that someone who has an Xbox or a PS3 is going to transition to the Wii U to play that, but maybe a Wii family that now has a kid who's old enough who wasn't when they got the Wii to jump into Call of Duty, is that a platform you think is going to be viable for that franchise? And then second, on -- I'll try the -- for Bobby, the question on next gen a little bit different way. Dovetailing some comments you made in the opening remarks about not placing resources on things you didn't think we\u2019re going to create shareholder value and where your franchise were going to do well, specifically things like Facebook or overbuying in the mobile space, and then a couple of years ago, there was a lot of fear there wouldn't ever be another console cycle because things like OnLive were going to divert energy from that space. And so now as we're approaching what appears to be another console cycle, you who have lived and grown through a number of them, are we going to have another console cycle? Is this going to be another successful period for the gaming industry where new hardware comes along and developers take advantage of that capability and come up with new experiences and grow the business?","Robert A. Kotick","I wish I could give you a more complex answer, but the truth is we can't really talk too much about next generation console plans, but I think it's safe to say you have a Wii U coming out, and there will be another new console coming, and we expect that there'll be very successful as they have been for 135 years at Nintendo. And we always evaluate all platforms with an eye towards being able to create the most compelling differentiated content. And whether it's Facebook as a platform or tablets or mobile devices as platforms, once we think that we can put our best creative foot forward and we can deliver something that's compelling and engaging and meaningfully different and really capitalize on the capabilities of a new platform, we'll support it.","Eric Hirshberg","And as for Call of Duty on Wii U, if you saw our presentation at the Wii U press event, I think most of the consensus, and we wholeheartedly agree, we think that Call of Duty looks great on the Wii U. We think it's a big step in the right direction for the types of games that we tend to make. The focus on a more robust online platform and the more -- the increased processing technology makes it a very legitimate experience. We think it will be a legitimate platform for the franchise.","Operator","And our next question comes from Neil Doshi from Citi.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Operator, do you want to put someone else on then?","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Neil.","Operator","Okay. Our next question will come from Brian Karimzad from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First one, Dennis, I heard the free cash flow number, but I didn't hear a share repurchase number. It looks like the share count didn't change much in the quarter. Can you comment on that?","Dennis Durkin","Yes, sure. Thanks, Brian. For obvious reasons, we don't really get into specifics on our buyback strategy. I guess I would note that year-to-date, we have returned more than $500 million to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. I think that over time we'll continue to focus on the long-term operating principles, which we've talked about and managed the business against for many years, which is focusing on a strong balance sheet, which we've mentioned on every call, strong cash flow and high return on invested capital.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","By the way, has something changed kind of on your view on the intrinsic value, kind of where you want to participate on it, because it's a meaningful reduction in the buyback versus the prior base [ph]?","Dennis Durkin","Yes, like I said, we just don't comment specifically about our buyback strategy.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the factors that are unique to this year, the $0.25 add up there with Diablo and the tax benefit, you didn't include the payout to -- on the Infinity War judgment. Was that matter of that being confidential or -- help us with that a bit?","Dennis Durkin","Yes, all of our legal agreement and settlements are obviously confidential. What we want to do is just call out a couple of the very important things that are impacting our great success this year and are not likely to recur next year. There's obviously a lot of puts and takes when you look at the 2013 plans relative to what will be inside of 2012. We're in the process, as a management team and as a business, of building our annual operating plans, which happens at this point every year and building that from the bottoms up, and we'll have a lot more details on the specifics of that in our next call. We really just want to call out those 2 specific items relative to the great record-shattering performance of Diablo III and then the discrete tax item that was about $0.25 [indiscernible].","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Call of Duty Elite change, I understand the rationale you explained, but I'm curious, was this an opportunity as well to approach the console makers themselves, maybe have some discussions on the economics there, given the additional value you're providing free on a platform that consumers are actually paying them to be part of?","Robert A. Kotick","No, I think what we said is the most important is we want to deliver the best possible user experience to our players, and we felt that the features and functions that were incorporated into Elite should be available to all of our players.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, but I mean, generally, as a philosophy, is that something you're still trying to pursue?","Robert A. Kotick","What, as a philosophy, is something\u2026","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The idea of improving the economics on the console platform, given the scale of Call of Duty?","Robert A. Kotick","I think we -- like we said, with respect to Elite, it really was a decision that was about our players. Generally, I think we -- whatever it is that we're evaluating as an opportunity is always with an eye towards improving shareholder value.","Operator","And we'll go back to Neil Doshi with Citi.","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mike, can you talk a little bit about how Mists of Pandaria is doing in China and what sort of traction you're seeing there? And then, also, could you guys comment on mobile? I know it's pretty small right now. We've seen a pretty nice uptick in terms of mobile games on iOS. At what point is -- I guess at what point do you see a tipping point where Activision Blizzard can get more religious on mobile? Is it more on the hardware side i.e. better graphics and better processing power? Or is it more in terms of adoption and how you can really bring the games to the mobile platform?","Michael Morhaime","Okay. So on the first question, we're very pleased with the reception in China. Players seem to be really enjoying the game. We\u2019ve seen an increased engagement in China as we have in all of the regions. Specifically with respect to China, I can share that we did hit a peak in currency over 1 million users, and so we're very happy to see that as well.","Eric Hirshberg","And on mobile, I think that we're pleased with the fact that in our first year of this kind of prudent investment, we were able to release 4 top-rated and top-selling games on iOS, and it's a Software-as-a-Service, so it takes time to build the install base and to see the monetization really gain traction. I can't give any specific timings as to where that tipping point you referenced might come, but we think we're making investments at the right scale in line with the opportunity.","Operator","And moving on to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You beat non-GAAP revenue guidance by about $60 million or so, but you're raising guidance by about $175 million. Can you give as any color on what is driving the optimism as you head into the fourth quarter, maybe the top 2 or 3 drivers there. And just real quick on Skylanders, any update on tax rates compared with last year?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. The second question was on Skylanders and tax rates. I'll -- it's Dennis speaking. I'll speak to that. Obviously we feel very good in raising our number, the $0.11 raise on non-GAAP for the full year getting up to $1.10. We have obviously better visibility now into what the pre-orders look like for Call of Duty and some more comfort relative to that. And then Skylanders is off to a very, very strong start. And I\u2019d just say on both of those, with both of those properties we have better and stronger retail support than we've ever had. Eric talked earlier about the square footage of retail and the expansion of that. I think the merchandising is better than we've ever had. And when you look at our Q4 guidance year-over-year, a lot of that's attributable to the fact that the bullishness that we have relative to Skylanders in Q4 in particular.","Operator","Next will be Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I know this question may be a little bit unfair, but on Skylanders for some context, Eric, I'm wondering if we should think about the franchise as having a profile similar to Guitar Hero, which had a healthy business for a couple of years. Or does the game and toy integration like we have with Skylanders, does that potentially present a much longer shelf life in your view? And I have a quick follow-up.","Eric Hirshberg","All I'll comment on is what I said in my earlier comments, which is that we have a pipeline already in development of just spectacular innovation. And we think that's the key to continued robust performance for the franchise, and we think that we can continue to surprise and delight and exceed kids' expectations. And as far as the reference to Guitar Hero, while there is a new play pattern that's been introduced with Skylanders, I think that's fair, I would say that this is a combination of 2 play patterns that have been pretty healthy for a long time. Toys have been in existence since the beginning of time, and video games are a pretty healthy industry, and we brought the 2 together in an unprecedented way. So we feel very bullish about the long-term potential of the franchise.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then second, Bobby, you've been pretty consistent on your high-level comments, I think, about 2013. And I wonder how we should think about the impact on current gen software sales, whenever it is that the buzz really starts to build for new hardware and if that's a factor in your cautious remarks about next year.","Robert A. Kotick","Well I think what we've seen historically is, as you get deeper into the cycle, you start to see pricing change for all but the most desired titles. And we've had a very long cycle for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and it's probably prudent to be thinking about pricing changes as you continue to get deeper in the console transitions.","Operator","The next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, on Call of Duty, does your outlook this year, I know you're revising it upward, can you tell us if you're expecting units or revenues to grow year-over-year versus last year for the total franchise? And then second, I appreciate the outlook for '13 and some help with that. I think, Eric, you mentioned in your comments that I think you're expecting the Call of Duty China launch and a Bungie launch. Were those -- were you meaning to say that those would be next year? And can you give as any framework around -- I know you won\u2019t give us revenues, but maybe a framework around the opportunity for those 2?","Dennis Durkin","Why don't I start? And Eric if you want to talk, [indiscernible], but I guess just as it relates to Call of Duty outlook for the year, as we said for -- since the beginning of the year, we have it forecasted to be modestly down, and we always plan very conservatively and prudently. We're optimistic about seeing the pre-order number, but in terms of our financials, that's how we do our forecasting. And then as it relates to the title, as we mentioned in that, there wasn't -- Eric, I think was talking about the pipeline. He wasn't talking about any specific launch date.","Eric Hirshberg","Yes, we haven't confirmed any launch dates. I was speaking about our future opportunities, investments. We\u2019ve still got a lot to do this year, and we're looking forward to talking to you about next year on next year's call.","Operator","Next will be Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","For Mike, maybe I wanted to follow up. You mentioned you're at above 1 million peak in current users in China. I just wondered how that maybe compared to levels that you've hit after prior expansion launches. And then secondly, if you could just talk about where you are with DOTA All-Stars?","Michael Morhaime","Sure. Let me start with the second one, which is Blizzard All-Stars is in development, and we're doing some great work. Some internal testing is underway. We're doing a lot of things to experiment with game play, and I don't really have anything concrete to announce on this call, other than we're very excited about the game. So with respect to China, I really don't have anything to announce in terms of historical comparables. I think -- other than to say that the engagement has increased with the launch of the expansion, and we're very happy with the reception.","Operator","And our last question will come from Stephen Ju with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So, Mike, the prior iterations of Diablo seem to have had an expansion pack released about 1 year after the game itself came out. So wondering if you have anything you can share in terms of whether or not you have a similar plan for Diablo III to keep your users engaged. And I'll ask the Call of Duty Online question another way, if you can update us on the beta testing schedule if you can and subsequently when we can expect a commercial launch.","Michael Morhaime","So we do have a plan -- an expansion planned for Diablo. I don't have any timeline to talk about. I think that the most important thing for us always comes down to the quality of the expansion and the gameplay, and so that will be a big factor in terms of driving our schedule.","Eric Hirshberg","And as for China, while you used different words, I don't know if you succeeded in asking it a different way. We haven't made any announcements on either our beta schedule or our launch and don't have any announcements today.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Well, on behalf of everyone at Activision Blizzard, we want to thank you for your time and consideration. And we look forward to speaking with you again in February. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today's call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Kristin Southey. Please go ahead, Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's third quarter 2013 conference call. With me today are Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; and Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","As indicated on the slide that is showing, a number of important factors that could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: sales levels of Activision Blizzard's titles; the impact of the current macroeconomic environment; increasing concentration of titles; shifts in consumer spending trends; Activision Blizzard's ability to predict consumer preferences, including interest in specific genres such as first-person action, Toys to Life, and massively multiplayer online games, and preferences among competing hardware platforms; maintenance of relationships with key personnel, customers, licensees, licensors, vendors and third-party developers, including the ability to attract, retain and develop key personnel and developers that can create high-quality titles; the seasonal and cyclical nature of the interactive entertainment market; changing business models, including digital delivery of content; competition, including from used games and other forms of entertainment; possible declines in software pricing; product returns and price protection; product delays; adoption rate and availability of new hardware, including peripherals, and related software, particularly during the ongoing console transition; rapid changes in technology and industry standards; the current regulatory environment; litigation risks and associated costs; protection of our proprietary rights; counterparty risks relating to customers, licensees, licensors and manufacturers; domestic and international economic, financial and political conditions and policies; foreign exchange rates and tax rates; potential challenges associated with geographic expansion; the possibility that expected benefits related to the recently completed transactions with Vivendi may not materialize as expected; the amount of our debt and the limitations imposed by the covenants in the agreements governing our debt; and the other factors identified in the Risk Factors section of Activision Blizzard's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as amended, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013.","These important factors and other factors that potentially could affect the company's financial results are described in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as amended, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period and other filings with the SEC. The company may change its intentions, beliefs or expectations made at any time and without notice based upon any changes in such factors in the company's assumptions or otherwise.","The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation and while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 6, 2013, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.","I'd like to note that certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; expenses related to stock-based compensation; the amortization of intangible assets; expenses relating to the purchase transaction and related debt financing; and the associated tax benefit. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted at www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation.","There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a 12-quarter financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a 1-page summary sheet. This quarter, we have also added a number of EBITDA metrics to our earnings release and slides for our new debt investors and analysts.","And now I'd like to introduce Bobby Kotick, our CEO.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and welcome, everyone. Today, we're hosting our earnings call as an independent public company for the first time in 5 years. As of October 11, the majority of our shares are now held by public shareholders. The transaction we completed on October 11 is representative of the focused approach to creating shareholder value that we've employed for more than 2 decades.","As you'll hear in detail today, there are immediate benefits to our shareholders in the form of earnings per share accretion, and most importantly, our transaction provides the strategic and operational independence we need to drive long-term stakeholder value. The management team is more energized and empowered than ever, and we remain committed to generating long-term superior returns and effectively managing our capital structure.","Our return to independence could not come at a more important time. This month, Sony and Microsoft will launch new consoles for the first time in more than 7 years. These consoles will enable our games to be even better, richer, more immersive, more engaging and more entertaining. PC games like Diablo III have established new records for sales and for engagement, and tablets and mobile devices are now starting to provide opportunities to create differentiated and compelling new types of games and access to new audiences and new geographies. All of these trends are resulting in larger audiences around the world for games.","Platform transitions have always presented great opportunities, as well as short-term challenges. We're well prepared to capitalize on these new opportunities, and we've been very adept at managing through the risks of hardware and business model transitions for over 22 years.","Our industry-leading capabilities embodied in the most talented group of employees in all of video games have enabled us to create the very best interactive content across varied platforms and varied business models, always with the ability to prioritize these investments against the opportunities that will provide the highest returns to our stakeholders. And we continue to, of course, establish new bars for creative excellence.","While our focus is always on the long term, we did have another quarter with better-than-expected financial results as a result of the continued success of our most popular games. Call of Duty generated record results both in Q3 and for the year-to-date, and we shipped over $1 billion of Call of Duty: Ghosts to retailers around the world.","Call of Duty as a franchise remains incredibly high -- with high levels of engagement, and in fact, Q3 was a record high for Call of Duty franchise engagement. Skylanders remains the #1 kids video game franchise year-to-date and has generated over $1.5 billion in sell-through life-to-date, including toys and accessories. World of Warcraft remains the world's #1 subscription-based MMORPG and ended the quarter with approximately 7.6 million subscribers. And Diablo III, the world's best-selling PC action RPG, was the first Blizzard franchise to be made available to console players in more than a decade.","In a year with many market challenges, our performance for the quarter and first 9 months of 2013 has been strong, and today, we are increasing our calendar year outlook.","Despite short-term uncertainties, as we look forward to 2014, we have a very strong product pipeline. We expect multiple new releases across our major franchises, including the first Diablo III expansion, Reaper of Souls, along with the PS4 version of Diablo III and significant and exciting new content for World of Warcraft.","We also expect to launch new Call of Duty and Skylanders titles and a major new potential franchise with Bungie's Destiny. We're also continuing to develop Call of Duty Online in partnership with Tencent for the large and growing Chinese market and Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm.","Because of our industry-leading talent, technology, scale, focused management team and deep financial resources, we are well positioned for long-term sustained success. In the coming year, we'll continue to invest prudently to build world-class entertainment franchises, broaden our leadership position and expand our global footprint. As an independent company, we have a strong foundation to take advantage of a variety of future opportunities and to remain focused on generating strong cash flow and delivering superior returns to all of our stakeholders.","And now Dennis will review our results and our outlook.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will start with a brief recap of the Vivendi transaction, followed by a review of our better-than-expected September quarterly results and our increased outlook for the full year.","On October 11, just after the end of the quarter, Activision Blizzard closed our share purchase and recapitalization transaction with Vivendi. On that date, Activision Blizzard brought back approximately 429 million shares or around 38% of our outstanding shares for $13.60 per share in cash, reflecting a 20% discount to the October 11 closing price of $17.08. Activision Blizzard funded the deal, including transaction fees and upfront interest, with approximately $1.2 billion of balance sheet cash and $4.75 billion of newly issued debt. Our financing included $2.5 billion of 7-year bank debt, $1.5 billion of 8-year notes and $750 million of 10-year notes. In addition, we established a $250 million revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at closing.","All in, our weighted average interest rate came in at the low end of our August estimate at just less than 5%. On closing, the company paid Vivendi approximately 5.83 billion shares for the shares that were repurchased, which left us with more than $3 billion in cash on hand, approximately $500 million of which is held domestically. This significant cash balance helps secure our future financial stability. Going forward, we believe that our free cash flow generation will support the debt we have while also allowing us the flexibility to continue to invest in our business and drive value for all of our stakeholders over time.","So all in, we had a very solid execution and closing at favorable financing rates a shareholder-friendly transaction. I'd like to thank both our internal teams and our external advisors for their tireless efforts in getting this deal over the goal line. It is nice to, once again, be an independent company with a newly optimized capital structure, a lower weighted average cost of capital and a higher return on equity for our shareholders.","Now let's turn to business and our better-than-expected Q3 results. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $691 million, including a record 59% of revenues from digital channels, and operating margin of 10% and EPS of $0.05. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we generated revenues of $657 million, with 61% of revenues coming from digital channels. We generated an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22%, with adjusted EBITDA being defined as non-GAAP operating income before depreciation. We also delivered an operating margin of 19% and EPS of $0.08.","Revenues in the quarter were driven by Activision Publishing's Call of Duty and Skylanders and Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft and the launch of Diablo III on consoles. As expected, our results were below last year, when we had the Q3 launch of the World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria expansion pack and continued sell-through of Diablo III on PC.","Turning to the specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate.","For GAAP in Q3, product costs were 22%, better than expected due to higher digital revenues. Total operating expenses were 68%, in line with our outlook as higher revenues offset transaction costs in the quarter, which totaled $62 million. Interest expense was $4 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP.","Our GAAP tax rate was 15% below our outlook due to the transaction costs I just mentioned. For non-GAAP in Q3, product costs were 24% and operating expenses were 57%, both better than expected on higher revenues. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 28%, roughly in line with expectations.","In terms of cash flow for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, our operating cash flow was $1.36 billion. And less capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.28 billion, which comes after making significant investments in our multiyear pipeline and back-end infrastructure.","Turning to the balance sheet. Given the transaction did not close by quarter end, we had not fully funded our financing. The $2.25 billion of 8- and 10-year notes had priced and funded in mid-September but were held in escrow pending closing of the deal. The $2.5 billion of bank debt had not yet been funded at quarter end. So the note proceeds, interest and some associated fees totaling $2.3 billion were held as cash in escrow and are the only part of the financing which shows up on our September balance sheet.","Following the closing of the transaction on October 11, we had total debt of $4.75 billion and approximately $3.4 billion in cash and investments, net of the $1.2 billion that was paid out at closing. With trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $1.74 billion, our total gross debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 2.7x. And importantly, our net debt to trailing EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA was approximately 0.8x.","Now let's turn to our 2013 full year outlook. As we have said for more than a year now, console transition years are volatile and hard to predict, and this year is proving no different. In spite of this backdrop and based on our solid performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year outlook for the year. However, we still remain cautious for the fourth quarter. Today, we announced that we had shipped into retail more than $1 billion of Call of Duty: Ghosts globally on day 1 based on an average wholesale price.","As expected, due to the console transition and digital distribution, this number is down versus last year. This year, the sell-through curve will be different than in past years due to the multiple launches of new hardware later in the month and more days between our launch and the high-volume Black Friday at the end of the month. That said, it's a very solid achievement and shows the tremendous confidence our retail partners have and the strength of the game and franchise heading into this holiday.","So let's walk through the numbers. For 2013, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $4.32 billion, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 49%. We expect interest of $58 million, a full year tax rate of 23% and a fully diluted weighted average share count of 1.06 billion, which is higher than our prior outlook given the transaction closed on October 11 instead of September 30. For the calendar year, we are raising our full year GAAP EPS outlook to $0.83.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $4.285 billion, product costs of 26% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect an operating margin of 31%, interest expense of $58 million, a full year tax rate of 25% and the same higher share count as GAAP. We are also increasing our non-GAAP EPS outlook to $0.89, about $0.03 higher than the high end of our previous estimate, partially offset by the increased share count.","In the December quarter, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.255 billion, product costs of 23%, operating expenses of 69% and an operating margin of 8%. We expect interest expense of $54 million and a GAAP tax rate of 23%. We expect a share count of 785 million, up from our prior outlook of 743 million due to the delayed closing. We are also raising our GAAP EPS outlook to $0.05.","For the December quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $2.215 billion, product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 36%, which is higher than our previous outlook due in part to increased marketing investment for our franchise launches. We expect an operating margin of 37%, interest expense of $54 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% and a higher share count of 785 million. The impact of the higher share count is approximately $0.04, and we now expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 in the quarter.","On a pro forma basis, assuming the transaction took effect January 1, 2013, our full year GAAP EPS would be $1.06 and our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook would be $1.16. The significant accretion, which came in above our range, reflects a 38% reduction in our fully diluted shares outstanding, partly offset by approximately $220 million in incremental pretax interest expense associated with the new debt.","Looking ahead, in spite of a challenging and volatile 2013 and with our transaction closed and behind us, we are excited about the future and the new and innovative experiences we are building for our global customers. In 2014, we plan to continue delivering innovation and quality in our slate, to continue expanding our retail and digital presence and to continue focusing on costs and maintaining strong credit quality. In 2014, we have a bigger slate planned as compared to 2013, with multiple Blizzard titles, Destiny and new Call of Duty and Skylanders games.","We will also be entering the second year of the new console cycle, which will enable more digital opportunities for us to connect even more deeply with our players. We look forward to sharing more details about our 2014 plans and outlook, as we always do, in February, following completion of the 2013 holiday season and our annual operating plan in January.","Now I'll turn the call over to Eric Hirshberg to discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. I'll start with a quick recap of our Q3 performance, and then I'll discuss current industry dynamics, our slate and our pipeline. I'm pleased to announce that Activision Publishing produced a record Q3 and year-to-date performance in terms of operating income. I want to thank our tremendously talented and passionate employees who continually find ways to deliver best-in-class execution and record results, even during a challenging console transition year.","Today, market fundamentals are mixed. Demand for many annualized AAA titles are down as consumers continue to show hesitation ahead of the launch of next-gen consoles. In fact, some games based on top-selling franchises are significantly down versus last year. While we don't expect to be immune to these industry-wide patterns and while we expect the sales curve to be shaped differently this year given the mid-quarter launch of next-gen consoles and the fact that Black Friday is later this year, we also know that purchase intent and awareness for our key titles are strong. We're also seeing increased supply and demand for next-gen consoles, and we believe consumers will reward those who have breakthrough next-gen games ready at launch, and we do.","Historically, following console transitions, the top franchises have emerged stronger than when they entered the cycle. We believe that our 2 top 5 franchises, Call of Duty and Skylanders, are well positioned and will emerge stronger over the long term. For both Call of Duty and for Skylanders, one of the keys to our success has been our ability to keep players engaged with new content all-year long.","Year-to-date, Call of Duty digital revenues set new franchise records. The franchise also set a new record for online engagement with over 4 billion hours played online. Put simply, players are spending more of their time and money online with Call of Duty than ever before.","In fact, in the last 12 months, Black Ops II, including digital sales, has generated more revenue than any other console game ever has in a single year. If you took Black Ops II digital revenue alone this year and judge it as a standalone game, it would be the third largest game at retail this year, behind only GTA V and Skylanders Giants, including toys and accessories.","Call of Duty has long had the largest and most engaged console player base in the industry. We now offer multiple ways for our players to stay engaged with the game, including \u00e0 la carte DLC packs, micro DLC and Season Pass, and these additions have proven to have value to our players. And they have transformed our revenues from a simple equation of units times price to the equation of players times revenue per player. By providing tremendous value and variety to our players, we are now able to monetize play all year round better than ever before, and our record digital revenues this year proved that out.","Yesterday, we launched our new Call of Duty game, Call of Duty: Ghosts. And the game launched at a time that the franchise has never been more popular. We have 15,000 midnight openings around the world, and while it's too early to assess sell-through, we have sold more than $1 billion of Call of Duty: Ghosts into retail stores worldwide already. Call of Duty: Ghosts has moved quickly into the #1 spot as the most played game on Xbox LIVE, and millions of people are already playing Call of Duty: Ghosts online and loving the game.","On the Xbox 360, we're seeing average player sessions for Ghosts which have been longer than either Black Ops II or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 during the same time period. Ghosts is a great game. It has an amazing and diverse single-player campaign, meaningful innovation to the genre's most played and most beloved multiplayer game and an innovative and deep new third mode called Extinction.","Ghosts offers more variety and depth of gameplay on the disc than any competitive offering in the genre. For Call of Duty: Ghosts, we once again plan on offering a compelling array of digital items that will let players personalize their game experience like never before. Also, Call of Duty: Ghosts will be available via digital download on Xbox 1 and PS4 on the same day that it's available in stores. So fans can get the game where they want and how they want.","For gamers who plan to purchase the next-gen console but want to start playing now, we're offering seamless upgrade programs at both Microsoft and Sony, as well as selected retail partners. For a limited time fans can purchase Call of Duty: Ghosts for their current console and then download the next-gen version of the game within the same console family for just $10 whenever they're ready. When they get their new console, they'll be able to -- they will be a step ahead both by having learned the mass and by having all their player achievements migrate with them into the next-gen game.","We're excited about yesterday's launch, but it's obviously still very early. We've had great support from our retail partners, and the game looks and plays incredibly well on both the current and next-gen systems.","Now turning to our second billion-dollar franchise, Skylanders.","Skylanders breakthrough concept of bringing Toys to Life has redefined kids video games and collectible toys and established an entirely new genre of play. Innovation and quality are at the heart of the franchise's success, and I want to thank Vicarious Visions for delivering the most innovative and highest-rated Skylanders game yet, with Skylanders SWAP Force.","Skylanders SWAP Force launched on October 13 with awareness and purchase intent that have never been higher. Consistent with other annualized AAA titles, initial sell-through is down in this console transition year versus last year. We believe demand remains strong but expect a different-shaped sell-through curve than we saw last year.","We're just entering the holiday shopping season. Our next-gen launches and majority of our sell-through are still ahead of us. But we're taking nothing for granted, which is why we are investing in the largest marketing and retail campaign in the franchise's history, with over 20% more shelf space from our retail partners and more media presence than ever before. With a great game, high awareness and purchase intent, strong retail partnerships and focused execution, we plan to enhance our leadership for now and for the years ahead.","So to summarize, Activision Publishing delivered a record Q3 and a record year-to-date. While overall industry dynamics remain challenging, we're confident in the quality of our games, the quality and scale of our launch plans, and we have the best go-to-market execution in our history.","Looking forward to 2014, we plan to release new games based on Call of Duty and Skylanders, as well as Destiny, the only universe from Bungie. Reception for Destiny at Gamescom was incredible. All told, Destiny has received about 75 awards, including Best of Show, at Gamescom and is on track to achieve the most preorders of any new IP in history.","Our goal is to establish a new intellectual property for the next 10 years, and we're making substantial investments in both product development and marketing. The game looks amazing on both current and next-gen consoles, and most importantly, it's just a lot of fun. We're very excited about the upcoming beta in 2014, and we can't wait for you to have a chance to play it for yourselves.","As you know, we're also working with Tencent to bring Call of Duty Online to the massive Chinese online market. The game is looking great. We look forward to sharing more details about our plans with you in the future.","In the coming year, we will keep our focus exactly where it has been, on delivering breakthrough innovation and genre-leading quality with every game we launch. We believe that our focused strategy of delivering AAA titles to drive year-round engagement is working. This strategy has served us very well in the past and we believe will position us for long-term success in the future.","And now I'll turn it over to Mike Morhaime for an update on Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime","Thank you, Eric. Q3 was an eventful quarter for Blizzard. We launched our first console game in many years with Diablo III. We also announced an expansion pack for Diablo III, Reaper of Souls. Additionally, beta testing for Hearthstone kicked off, and we released a significant new content update for World of Warcraft. All of this activity has netted out to a strong quarter, where we ended higher in net revenue and operating income versus Q2 mostly due to the Diablo III console launch in September. Revenues and income were down year-over-year, as expected, due to the successful launch of Mists of Pandaria and ongoing sales of Diablo III during the same quarter last year.","Going into more specific detail with World of Warcraft, we're very pleased with the response to Siege of Orgrimmar, the massive content update we released in September. This update included a huge new raid dungeon with major story elements, as well as a new area to explore and features that improved the game's accessibility. Flexible rates now allow groups of variable size to participate in the endgame raiding dungeons.","Meanwhile, the proving grounds feature trains players to improve at playing specific roles, preparing them to participate in endgame content. Player response to the content has been good, and we saw increased engagement that has contributed to maintaining relatively stable subscribership quarter-over-quarter. We'll continue to invest heavily in World of Warcraft to deliver frequent, high-quality content to our players.","Moving on to Diablo III, we're pleased with the response to the game's launch on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Lifetime sell-through of the game across all platforms has reached over 14 million copies, and reviews have been very positive about how the game plays on console. Much of the praise has been centered on changes we made to the loot system and our decision to keep the auction house off of the console platform. Players and critics alike have noted that these changes have resulted in a more fun and satisfying game experience. That reaction factored in our decision to remove the auction houses from the PC version of Diablo III effective next March, which players have also responded very positively to.","We're building upon those design philosophies for loot and incorporating them into Reaper of Souls, the Diablo III expansion pack which is coming for PC and PS4 in 2014. In addition to the new loot system, Reaper of Souls will include an additional player class, the Crusader, and more gameplay modes for the endgame to keep players engaged. The reaction to Reaper of Souls at Gamescom was very positive, and we're looking forward to revealing more about the game at BlizzCon.","It was also a busy quarter for Hearthstone, our free-to-play digital card game for PC and iPad based on the Warcraft universe. In Hearthstone, players build decks of cards that feature familiar spells and creatures from World of Warcraft and battle against each other using the cards. Players can collect cards simply by playing or by purchasing digital packs. They can also purchase entries into a special competitive mode of play called The Arena in exchange for either in-game currency or a small fee.","We've seen a great response from the community with the closed beta test, which kicked off in August. Hearthstone quickly became one of the most popular streamed games on Twitch, and we have been expanding the beta test to encompass more regions and a wider group of players. We're continuing to work on polishing the game as we drive towards open beta testing.","Rounding out our big announcements since the last call is the name change of Blizzard All-Stars to Heroes of the Storm, which is our take on free-to-play hero brawlers. We've done an extensive internal test on Heroes over the past several months, and as the game has evolved, we felt it was appropriate to change the name to something more fitting of the gameplay experience.","We're looking forward to sharing more details about Heroes at BlizzCon, which is taking place this weekend at the Anaheim Convention Center. This is another sold-out show, with more than 20,000 attendees coming to Anaheim from more than 40 different countries.","Our global community will also follow along through DIRECTV, online pay-per-view on blizzcon.com and partner broadcast in other regions. We'll be showcasing our biggest pipeline of games ever and showing our appreciation for our community through contests, meet-and-greets and of course, major eSports spectacles. The World of Warcraft Arena invitational and the global grand finals of the StarCraft II World Championship Series will be taking place, along with an invitational tournament for Hearthstone, featuring popular community personalities.","All of us at Blizzard can't wait to get back to BlizzCon and connect with our players. We hope you'll join us there or follow along online with a virtual ticket available online at blizzcon.com. We're looking forward to celebrating a shared passion of gaming with our players, hearing their feedback on our newest game content and taking that energy and knowledge back to work as we drive toward an exciting 2014 for Blizzard.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, I think we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I know we have to wait through the holiday to get a better sense for Skylanders' performance. Can you give us an idea for how the SWAP Force launch compared to Spyro's or to Giants maybe in terms of things like character tie ratios? And then really quickly, are you seeing a big difference for the -- in terms of developing and delivering on the different consoles, the next-gens? There's a lot of discussion right now around -- noise around native versus upscale 1080p. Is that something that really differentiates a platform, or can that be improved as your hardware partners do software updates that rejigger the -- and free up resources, GPU, memory, et cetera?","Eric Hirshberg","I'll take both of those. First of all, on SWAP Force, as we've noted throughout the year, this is a year unlike past years, when we've launched games like Spyro's Adventure and Giants. And what we're seeing for SWAP Force this year is that some markets are down, some markets are up. Overall, we're down, which is not unexpected. The 2 main issues here is that we've invented a category 2 years ago, and for the past few years, we've had a competitive landscape completely to ourselves. This year, we've had 2 major competitors, with both Disney and Pokemon launching the day before us, as you guys know. And second, Skylanders is also not immune to the effects of the console transition year. In fact, our quantitative research has shown that this is one of the top reasons that parents who've shown an intent to purchase the game are hesitating. But there are a couple of things that are important to remember. One is the vast majority of our sales historically on this franchise have come in November and December, ramping up towards the holiday. Two is that we have a great game, the best game in the franchise's history. Three is that toy attach is as strong as ever. And four is that awareness and purchase intent are also as strong as ever. So we're staying in the pocket, looking forward to a great holiday. On the second question you asked related to the console, that's really a better question for the first parties since they've taken different approaches to the design of the hardware and have different allocations for processing power that are available to developers. And the issue you're raising has been consistent across multiple games in similar genres to ours. What I can assure you is that we've worked hard to maximize the performance on each and every platform that we've release the game on and that we think we have the next-gen launch title being Call of Duty: Ghosts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian, Robert Baird & Co.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. I guess curious now that the transaction is behind you, I'm wondering how you're approaching further development plans and customer support, Mike, for World of Warcraft just given the changing mix of the user base towards Western markets. And with the content update, I'm wondering if you could provide a little more color on what the distribution of the users are geographically?","Michael Morhaime","Well, in the last quarter, the user base has been pretty stable. I think that the way we're viewing customer service for WoW, of course, we want to maintain a high quality of service to our players, but I think we want to continue to look at more efficient and better ways of doing that. And so there are a lot of efforts going towards improving customer self-help so that our millions of players don't actually have to contact us directly. But in terms of the content and developing, we have more resources focused on developing content for World of Warcraft than ever before. So we expect to continue having a long and happy life.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Your MMO costs of goods sold was down roughly significantly quarter-over-quarter. Was there some permanent cost reductions that might have happened that are driving that or was that just more of a normal fluctuation?","Dennis Durkin","Yes, I'll take that. I mean, cost of goods sold can vary based on our mix in any one quarter, and so I wouldn't use that as sort of a long-term guidance. I think we're always looking across the capitals -- or across our expense base to drive efficiencies, but it's more the cost cash base [ph] than anything. So I'd just look at our forward guidance as the best barometer for what's to come relative to that. Obviously, Skylanders mix has a big play relative to overall cost of goods sold because of the...","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I was referring specifically to the MMO line item.","Dennis Durkin","Oh, okay. I'm sorry. We brought the MMO line item relative to the cost reduction and the savings that we've seen. I mean, it's kind of tied to the previous question, where we've actually been more efficient over time with -- in terms of driving cost out of our online operations and our customer service. It relates very much to what Mike's talked about before in terms of self-help and getting more efficient with that. And I think the team's done a great job of embracing new goals to become better at that over time. So I think that's certainly -- we think about optimizing our efficiency. That's an area across -- not only the Blizzard side but the Activision Publishing side that we're very focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Avi Steiner of JPMorgan.","Avi Steiner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Given the recent change in ownership, how should investors think about the pace of new game introductions, the international opportunities? And just related to that, any updated thoughts on maybe bringing some cash back?","Robert A. Kotick","Yes, the benefit that we have now of not having a majority shareholder is operating independence, but that won't change the overall strategy of the company. We're continuing to be focused on investing in our franchises, building out new franchises, expanding new geographies, prioritizing our investments towards the greatest opportunities for the benefit of our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Williams of BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of questions. First of all, Eric, can you just kind of go back to Call of Duty and what your expectations are for kind of downloadable content as in the early stages of the game, looking at this year versus prior iterations of it? And then Bobby, just curious if you can comment a little bit about looking at the next platform cycle, having gone through a number of these cycles in the past, what your thoughts are as far as the early adoption is concerned for those cycles and what we could see with attach rates and the like?","Eric Hirshberg","On the first one, it's too soon to tell. It depends on a lot of other factors. But I can tell you what we know so far. So far, attach rate on things like Season Pass has been very strong, and we're also seeing longer average session length so far, meaning more engagement with the players, with the millions of players who are already online enjoying the game. Historically, more engagement has meant better monetization over time because people are more engaged and more willing to do things like purchase DLC or purchase micro DLC or purchase a Season Pass. So we're pleased by those longer average engagement times. We also -- we're thinking ahead when we developed our third mode with Extinction. And obviously, we've seen how that third mode can play a big role in a long tail on a rich DLC season, and so you'll see a great slate of content coming our players' way in the wake of Ghosts, including a lot of Extinction content, so we'll have a fantastic season to look forward to.","Robert A. Kotick","And with respect to the introduction of new the hardware, you know this almost better than anybody, but you've got 2 laser-focused large companies who have important future benefits that come from continued investment against the successful launch of these platforms. They've made more investments in the back office than ever before. I think you've got lots of efficiencies in manufacturing cost that can potentially drive hardware pricing down sooner in the cycle. But there's no indication from our perspective that you're going to see anything other than a very successful next 7 or 8 years.","Operator","Our last question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.","Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Longer term, now that the transaction's closed, maybe an update on how you think about the right level of leverage for the company, coupled with how you're thinking about shareholder returns in general and sort of balancing the 2 on a going-forward basis.","Dennis Durkin","Sure. I'll take that one. This is Dennis. Thanks, Eric. Obviously, we're very comfortable with the level of debt that we took on as part of this transaction and sort of the cash flow generation that we have. We have a culture that's been very focused on cash generation, so it's not really a big change for us relative to sort of driving that. Going forward, debt service and sort of paying the amortization on the term loan will be our primary focus obviously. But as we've done every year and as we do every year, once we have visibility into how the holidays landed and how our annual operating plan looks, we'll make new capital allocation decisions in our January board meeting, and we'll talk more about that going forward. Frankly, we're very comfortable with the levels of debt that we have and the service ratios that we have to service that over time.","Operator","And this does conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to return the conference back to Kristin Southey for any concluding remarks.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Well, on behalf of everyone at Activision Blizzard, I want to thank you for your time and consideration. And hopefully, we'll see a lot of you at BlizzCon on Friday. So thank you.","Operator","This does conclude our conference call for today. You may now disconnect your lines. And everyone, have a great day."],"488":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; and Mike Morhaime CEO of Blizzard Entertainment.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call we will be making statements that are not historical facts.

Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks very much, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Q2 was another strong quarter and we have a lot of momentum going into the back half of this year. Our teams around the world continued to deliver the very best interactive entertainment and our franchises continue to be among the strongest in all of entertainment. On today's call, Thomas will discuss the key drivers of our over-performance, Dennis will review our financial results in detail, and then Mike and Eric will discuss the positive results in their respective operating units. Thomas.","Thomas Tippl - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Bobby. Our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property, innovating on new platforms, and expanding into new geographies is reflected in our results. We outperformed our Q2 targets and last year's results on revenues, digital growth, and earnings per share. These strong results and the excitement for upcoming launches have driven us to raise our full year outlook yet again. As we're successfully transitioning from a launch to a year-round engagement model, our audience base and the total amount of time people spend with our franchises continue to grow. In the second quarter, our monthly active users grew at 35% year-over-year. And in a world with so many entertainment choices from television to movies to social media and beyond, we are grateful that people are choosing to spend more and more of their time with us.","In the second quarter, the amount of time our community spent playing Activision Blizzard games grew by 25% year-over-year. In fact, this past quarter, our player communities logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play with our key franchises, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, Skylanders, Destiny, and Call of Duty. And these numbers do not even include the rapidly increasing amount of time expected to spend watching content based on our games on channels like Twitch and YouTube.","Our strategic investment in new franchises, platforms and geographies continue to pay off, and along with growing engagement and better monetization, set the stage for more growth ahead. We're well underway to expanding our franchise portfolio from 5 to over 10, with four new intellectual properties already launched and performing well. In addition, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return this fall with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about, and Overwatch is on the horizon with a beta this fall.","We have an increasing focus on mobile and tablet. Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones in April through the player base has been a key driver of our performance in Q2 and should benefit us for the foreseeable future. Guitar Hero Live fall release will also include mobile and tablet at launch, and we're redoubling our efforts to provide a great mobile experience for our Skylanders franchise, in addition to making the full game available on tablets.","Finally, we are positioned for growth in new geographies, and in particular in large and fast-growing China. We now have six franchises in market in China up from two at the start of last year and we're already seeing strong results with our teams and partners in China delivering record revenues in MAUs in Q2. Before I hand it over to Dennis, I want to thank our talented teams who continue to execute very well. Our employees are extraordinarily committed and they create the most engaging entertainment experiences for our players and it shows in our results, which Dennis is now going to take you through in detail.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our better than expected Q2 financial results, our outlook for Q3, and our increased outlook for 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.04 billion, up 8% year-over-year and operating margin of 32% and GAAP EPS of $0.29 up $0.08 versus our May guidance. For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis we generated revenues of $759 million and operating margin of 23%, up more than 550 basis points year-over-year and EPS of $0.13. We outperformed last year's revenue and EPS by $101 million and $0.07 respectively. At constant FX for Q2, we outperformed last year's revenue by $188 million or 29%, operating income by $116 million or 103%, and EPS by $0.13. In addition, we outperformed our May guidance by $109 million on revenue and $0.06 on EPS. Revenue and EPS outperformance was primarily due to strong growth in recurring revenue from digital content across our broad franchise portfolio. Importantly, total digital revenues grew 27% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $611 million.","The main franchise drivers of the quarter's performance were: Hearthstone, with the launch of their newest adventure, Blackrock Mountain, as well as the release of Hearthstone onto new Android and iOS smartphones; Destiny, with the launch of their second expansion, House of Wolves; Call of Duty with sales of Seasons Pass, DLC and microtransactions like Supply Drops for Advanced Warfare; Blizzard's Diablo III which launched and outperformed in China, helping drive record revenues in China for the company this quarter; and finally, Blizzard launched Heroes of the Storm globally on June 2. Note that this quarter was an important inflection point for Blizzard. In spite of World of Warcraft subscriber declines, which were more concentrated in the east, and partly affected by the success of Diablo III in China, Blizzard grew its Q2 revenues 29% year-over-year at constant FX. This performance was driven by the strong performances of Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, which in Q2 made up the majority of Blizzard revenues.","The franchise diversification inside Blizzard is happening rapidly and even more importantly the aggregate Blizzard community is healthy and growing and in Q2 reached the highest levels in Blizzard history on the back of strong engagement across the expanded portfolio. And the community will have even more to enjoy with an incredible lineup of new content for these franchises that is yet to come. You'll hear more details from Mike on Blizzard's engagement and pipeline later in the call.","In terms of EBITDA and cash flow, in Q2 we generated strong non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $193 million, up $47 million year-over-year, operating cash flow of $135 million and up 27% year-over-year and free cash flow of $107 million up 32% year-over-year. In Q2 we also paid our previously announced $0.23 per share cash dividend, a 15% increase year-over-year and had no share repurchases in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet as of June 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments of which approximately $800 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 million.","Turning to FX, please note, as discussed on our February and May calls, the strong dollar has had and will continue to be a headwind this year as our international revenues are translated at lower rates than last year. In Q2, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening of a dollar was $87 million on revenue and $0.06 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $154 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS.","Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and for the balance of 2015. We are planning one of the best content pipelines in our history for the back half of the year and the games are all progressing very well. You will hear more about our Q3 and Q4 slate from Eric and Mike. New releases include Destiny's mega expansion, The Taken King, Skylanders SuperChargers, Guitar Hero Live, Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Hearthstone's expansion, The Grand Tournament. One important addition is we are now confirming that the much anticipated final chapter for StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void is expected to be released in 2015 and will now be included in our guidance for the full year.","Looking forward to Q3, on a GAAP basis we expect net revenues of $875 million, product costs of 26% and operating expenses of 59%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 23%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $748 million, and EPS of $0.08. For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis we expect revenues of $930 million, product costs of 25% and operating expenses of 55%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.14. Note that our guidance is at FX spot rates as laid out in the accompanying slides on our IR website.","Now to our 2015 full year numbers. For 2015 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 48%, and GAAP interest income expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect $750 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.06 up $0.08 from our May guidance.","For 2015 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.6 billion, $175 million higher than our May guidance, product costs of 23%, operating expenses of 45%, and an operating margin of 32%, 100 basis points better than our May guidance. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.","For the second time this year, we are raising our EPS outlook. Our new outlook has increased by $0.10 to $1.30 based on strong franchise momentum coming out of Q2 and now including the StarCraft: Legacy of the Void in our full year numbers. At constant FX, we now project year-over-year growth on the top line and bottom line including record EPS for the year.","In summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends are driving our financial results so far this year and give us great momentum heading into the back half of the year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off. This backdrop sets the stage for growth as we take advantage of the best content pipeline in our history.","Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing significantly outperformed last year's result and delivered meaningfully higher digital revenues and operating income for the quarter and the first half of the year. Our Q2 and year-to-date revenues were each up 35% at a constant FX rate. We also continue to have 2 of the top 5 console franchises year-to-date in Skylanders and Call of Duty, and 3 of the top 5 next-gen games, life-to-date, including the number one slot.","This revenue performance is due to our proven ability to create great games that turn into beloved long-term franchises. In recent years we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio to now include three innovative and industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round. As a result, our monthly active users are up by more than 25% in Q2 year-over-year and each of these franchises contributed significantly to our overperformance year-to-date.","Let me share some specifics by franchise, starting with Call of Duty. In Q2, revenue was up by double-digit percentage year-over-year due to strong sell-through on Advanced Warfare, strong momentum in digital monetization as well as strong sell-through on catalog titles. I want to highlight Advanced Warfare's strong season of digital content in particular. Season pass, DLC, microtransaction, and average revenue per user have all grown year-over-year.","As we said on our last call, we introduced a new digital consumable mechanic called supply drops to which players have responded very positively. We maintained our already high engagement levels while monetization of that engagement significantly grew. We believe this approach will allow our average revenue per user to continue to grow in future years driving higher margins as more revenue is delivered digitally.","Which brings me to Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the November release from our award winning studio, Treyarch. In June, we provided the public with hands-on multiplayer at E3 for the first time in Call of Duty's history, and the response is overwhelmingly positive. In fact, since E3, the number of Black Ops II monthly active users has risen to over 11 million players, which is unprecedented in a game that's nearly three-years-old and particularly one that is only available on old generation systems.","We're also attracting new consumers into the Black Ops universe, with catalog sales of both Black Ops I and Black Ops II up significantly in North America for the first half of the year. Then at Comic-Con in July, we unveiled the Black Ops III Zombies mode, and again the fan reception was great. Their excitement was driven not only by the Zombies mode itself, but also by fans' realization of just how deep this game is going to be. Black Ops III will have three incredible play modes: campaign, multiplayer, and zombies inside one game. Each mode has its own sticky progression system, and we will offer a full season of follow on content to keep players engaged.","We couldn't be more excited for Call of Duty fans to experience Black Ops III multiplayer and that's why for anyone who pre-orders we're holding our first public beta in years starting in August. We can't wait for fans to play the game and provide feedback to help us make it even better at launch in November. We're also planning our most robust and expansive season of eSports for Call of Duty ever, and we'll have more details on that in the future.","On to Call of Duty Online, which is in open beta in China. As I've said before, this is a game that will take time to ramp and early signs on core player engagement are encouraging. In the last week of July, we launched a significant content and feature update and Tencent kicked off a marketing campaign to support new player acquisition. While it's too early to know, initial engagement trends after the update are positive, and we'll have more to share in future quarters.","Turning now to Destiny. In May, we along with our partners at Bungie released the highly acclaimed second expansion pack, House of Wolves. The percentage of Destiny players who have bought both expansion packs is the highest we have ever seen for any Activision Publishing game. Moreover, engagement of the game's millions of active users actually increased after we released House of Wolves, which is impressive for a game 10 months after its launch.","Destiny now has over 20 million registered players with an average of about 100 hours of gameplay each, showing great momentum as we head into our fall release. On September 15 comes the largest update to the Destiny universe yet, a mega expansion called The Taken King. We revealed The Taken King at E3, highlighting the all new campaign, subclasses, and brand new destination, and gaming reception was incredible.","For those who already own Destiny and both expansion packs, they can buy The Taken King for a suggested retail price of $40. For those who are new to the Destiny universe, we'll offer The Legendary Edition, which includes the original Destiny game, both expansion packs thus far, and all of the content in The Taken King for a suggested retail price of just $60. This obviously provides new players with a great value, but it's also the right thing to do for our community, as it will help us keep as many players as possible playing together in the same universe of content.","Onto Skylanders, the industry's top performing console franchise and title for the year so far. Despite the increasingly competitive toys-to-life category, we've maintained our leadership position, grown user engagement, and average revenue per user, and outsold all other action figure lines year-to-date.","Before we get to this year's release for Skylanders, let's take a step back and look at the toys-for-life category overall. As you know, this is a genre we created and had led ever since, transforming the way kids interact with toys in the process. Despite an ever increasing list of competitors and with strong characters from other mediums, we feel we are best positioned to continue to lead this category for one reason. We've delivered and will continue to deliver the best games with the biggest innovations. Games are at the heart of what we do and games are also at the heart of this genre since compelling gameplay is the way to drive toy sales.","This year's fall release, Skylanders SuperChargers, which we plan to launch on September 20 in North America and September 25 in Europe, will bring both action figures and vehicles to life for the first time, allowing our fans to drive, fly, and captain their way across land, air, and sea. This innovation increases the size of the pie, which will now include both action figures where consumers spent about $2.5 billion each year, and vehicle toys where consumers spend about $3.3 billion each year in North America and Europe alone.","Our proven ability to create great games in this space is what led to our unprecedented partnership with Nintendo to bring Donkey Kong and Bowser into Skylanders SuperChargers. As we had last year, the full game will be available on tablet, one of the world's fastest growing gaming platforms. We're also in development on a new mobile initiative for the Skylanders franchise and look forward to telling you more about it next week.","Finally Guitar Hero. As I said on our last call, Guitar Hero's brand affinity and name recognition are amongst the highest in our industry which gives us a strong platform from which to re-launch the brand. But neither we nor our fans would be content if we had simply repackaged an upgraded version of an old game. Guitar Hero Live is entirely new and the result of many years of meaningful creative innovation. It is one game with two ways to play: GH Live, which lets fans rock real crowds with real reactions, making you feel more like a rock star than ever before, and GHTV, which is the world's first playable music video network with hundreds of songs and a continual stream of new content to keep our players engaged. At E3, we gave the media a chance to play GHTV for the first time, and the response could not have been better. Our partners are equally excited, and retailers are allocating shelf space to us at multiples to what they are allocating to our competitors. And we'll have more music and promotional partnerships to announce as we get closer to launch, which we plan for October 20.","So, to close, Activision Publishing has had a great first half of the year built on innovative games that engage our passionate fans. The stage is set for a great second half as well, with major innovations across the portfolio, including Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Destiny, The Taken King, Skylanders SuperChargers, and Guitar Hero Live. We look forward to sharing more details with you at gamescom later this week.","Now I'll turn over the call to Mike to talk about Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Eric. Blizzard had another strong quarter in Q2, with multiple releases and more activity on more platforms than in any previous quarter. This new content led to incredible engagement across our player base. Monthly active users, the number of players who log into a game each month in the quarter, summed across our entire portfolio is a good indicator of the health of the Blizzard community.","In Q2 the average MAU across Blizzard games was up more than 50% year-over-year, achieving its highest level ever. Moreover Battle.net ended the quarter at an all-time high for active accounts. Again, up double digits percentage-wise year-over-year. These important metrics reflect the strength of our portfolio with many more people around the world playing more Blizzard games than ever before.","On the World of Warcraft front, in late June we launched one of our biggest non-expansion content updates ever, Patch 6.2, Fury of Hellfire. It added a new zone for players to explore, a new raid, and much more. This helped stabilize the subscriber base in the last part of the quarter. We're currently at work on a much anticipated update for the game that will bring flying to Draenor, add a new player versus player matchmaking feature and more. In addition, we're going to have exciting news at gamescom this week. We'll be announcing the next expansion for World of Warcraft.","We've been listening closely to our players about their experience with Warlords of Draenor, and we think they'll be really excited when they hear our plans. You can tune into the announcement through the Battle.net desktop app or the World of Warcraft website.","Hearthstone had a very good quarter, with multiple releases in quick succession. We launched the Blackrock Mountain adventure at the beginning of the quarter followed by the release of Hearthstone on mobile phones. We also added a popular new game mode called Tavern Brawl, which gives players a different way to play each week, for example, playing as a legendary monster from the game complete with a customized deck.","As a result of the new platform and all the new content, engagement for Hearthstone which was already very strong, nearly doubled year-over-year in terms of active players and time spent. The game continues to perform well in all major regions and remains a top viewed title on Twitch. We recently announced our new card expansion, The Grand Tournament. Like our first expansion, Goblins vs Gnomes, The Grand Tournament will add new game mechanics and a ton of new cards that will have an impact on how Hearthstone is played, which ultimately supports longer-term engagement. The Grand Tournament is due out this month, and we're already seeing a lot of excitement about it from the community. In addition, like other Blizzard games, Hearthstone has developed into a premier fixture in the competitive gaming scene. That includes our formal tournaments as well as community-driven events. A big example of the latter are fireside gatherings where members of the community post local Hearthstone get-togethers. This year alone the community has already held more than 1,300 fireside gatherings globally. Many of these offer participants a chance to secure a spot in the Hearthstone World Championship competition culminating at BlizzCon. We look forward to seeing which of these players rise up and make a name for themselves and how they fare against the established pro players who have advanced through our official tournaments.","Heroes of the Storm also had an exciting quarter with the team making solid progress in driving engagement. Following the June 2 game launch, the critical reception has been enthusiastic with many outlets giving Heroes of the Storm high marks for its innovations, accessibility, and depth. We've also seen consistently positive commentary from players and that's only increased as more try the game. One of the strengths of Heroes of the Storm is the fact that it draws on content from all of our franchises, giving our players familiar touch points in the game regardless of their familiarity with the genre. At the end of June, we started a series of updates that brought popular characters from Diablo, such as The Butcher and King Leoric, and the new Diablo-themed battleground, the Battlefield of Eternity to the game. Players have really enjoyed this event, which we're calling the Eternal Conflict, and it's still going on, so there is more to come.","We plan to continue a rapid cadence of Heroes of the Storm updates for the foreseeable future. This will constantly give players new character and strategy options which will support the game's long-term appeal. Heroes of the Storm eSports is another avenue for engagement and growth of our audience. We kicked off the collegiate scene in April with Heroes of the Dorm, a March Madness style tournament which culminated in a live finals event on ESPN2 and resulted in a lot of excitement across the Blizzard community. On the professional side, the game has been added to our Road to BlizzCon program and major tournaments are underway globally.","With the total prize pool of $1.2 million in cash and prizes and an opportunity to be crowned world champion at BlizzCon, the stakes are high and the competition has already been amazing. Q2 was also a very good quarter for Diablo III. We launched the game with a free model in China while offering two premium versions at $32 and $64. Despite the availability of the free option, the premium versions achieved record sell-through in China out the gate and it's continuing to perform well there. The take-up of Diablo III in China played a large part in driving Blizzard's record MAU globally, as well as in China specifically, for the quarter. In fact, Blizzard's total revenue in China this quarter reached a record high, driven in large part by the success of Diablo III there, as well as Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm.","I'm pleased to report that Diablo III as a whole has now sold through over 30 million copies globally. Players around the world are looking forward to the upcoming content patch, which will add the Ruins of the Barbarian City of Secheron for them to explore. It also adds a powerful item called Kanai's Cube which provides endless options for transmitting and upgrading their items. Blizzard gamers have always expected an outstanding level of entertainment from our games, and content updates such as this reflect our commitment to that standard.","Moving on to StarCraft II, the Legacy of the Void beta test continues to go well and we're excited to get the game into players' hands later this year. We recently started offering pre-purchases and as part of that, we're providing beta access along with advanced access to a set of campaign missions, titled Whispers of Oblivion, to anyone who pre-purchases the game. We've seen a lot of anticipation for this final chapter of the trilogy and even higher demand at this point in pre-sales compared to Heart of the Storm.","The Whispers of Oblivion content plus the multiplayer changes have been received very positively. This is gratifying because we're working hard to deliver a worthy finale to an epic story that's now been over 17 years in the making. One of the reasons we feel we can continue to expand our StarCraft II audience is that players no longer need to have the previous entries in the series in order to play Heart of the Storm or Legacy of the Void. This provides a great opportunity for players who might have missed one of the chapters in the trilogy to come back and jump right into the latest content.","We are also excited to bring StarCraft II multiplayer into a whole new era with new play modes and other changes that increase accessibility. One of the new modes, Archon Mode allows two players to team up and share control of an army, making the game even more fun to play with a friend.","We've seen a very enthusiastic response to this mode as well as a lot of anticipation about our other new co-op mode Allied Commanders, which we will be providing more detail about at gamescom.","Looking back at the amount of content we delivered this quarter, and the player response, we're really pleased with the performance and engagement overall. For the second half of the year, we're driving towards the milestones I mentioned in addition to the global beta test for Overwatch. We're particularly excited to carry the momentum from the first half of the year forward to BlizzCon in November, where we will have more to share with our community.","One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of this year's Road to BlizzCon eSports tournament, with the global champion for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm being crowned. This will be the most Blizzard eSports competitions ever contained under one roof, and we're really excited to see which of the world's top players make it to the main event and walk away with the grand prizes.","The global Blizzard community is now as big and as vibrant as it's ever been, and we're thrilled to be able to serve players across a wider range of genres and platforms than ever before. Looking across our entire portfolio and all the upcoming content in our pipeline, it's a great time to be a Blizzard gamer. Thank you. And I'll turn the call back to Amrita.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we'll now take a few questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And we'll hear first from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So on Hearthstone, can you guys discuss the revenue mix you're seeing for the game and what you've observed in terms of monetization on smartphones and whether or not that's led to any cannibalization against PC revenue? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks for the question. So we don't provide per-platform breakouts, but the launch on phones and the new content that we've recently released combined have led to a step change in Hearthstone's results. We're very pleased to see substantial growth across the board. We saw almost double the amount of active players in time spent year-over-year, and an increase in more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue on the new platforms appear to be incremental to PC.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","And we'll now hear from Chris Merwin, Barclays.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. So I just had a question about eSports. I know this has been an area of focus for you, most recently with some of the new free-to-play titles like Heroes of the Storm, which, Mike, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks. So could you please just talk about how eSports have helped in terms of driving player engagement and maybe what types of opportunities you see there over time? Thanks.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, that's a great question. We've said over the last few years that we see competitive gaming as (32:30) opportunity for the company, and obviously a great way to celebrate our players. The franchises like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty, and then future franchises like Overwatch, are going to be among the most important of all eSports franchises.","From our perspective, if you look at just spectating hours on our franchises, over the last 12 months, spectator hours have jumped to roughly 1.5 billion hours. And we expect that we're really in the first inning of eSports opportunities. So this is an area of great focus and attention and investment across the company and we expect that we'll continue to lead in eSports as we have since the beginning of eSports initiatives.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right, thanks very much. So Activision pioneered the toys-to-life genre, but since then this space has become a bit more crowded with competitors, particularly with bigger brand IP, Disney, Star Wars, Marvel, et cetera, now LEGOs. Just curious about how you're thinking about Skylanders and how it can compete over the next couple of years and beyond to maintain the lead?","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Sure, I understand the question. It's inarguable that the category has become much more crowded since we invented it a few years ago, but to be fair, we've been being asked some form of this question, how can you hold onto your lead versus competitors that have much better established characters from other mediums, since the \u2013 before the launch of the first Disney game. We're now several games past that and we've managed to retain our sizable lead at every step of the way.","We've already shown I think that established characters from other mediums are not the shortcut to leading this category. We believe we will continue to lead the category because we make the best games in the category, we consistently delivered the best innovations in the category, and our characters are built for interactive entertainment. And our creators have no constraints surrounding what those characters can and can't do in a video game. And we believe that's a key competitive advantage as well.","On the category itself, we think that the toys-to-life genre will continue to grow, and more broadly that the idea of physical toys that have digital lives is definitely here to stay. Also thus far, we've only brought one form of toys-to-life with action figures. As I mentioned, with SuperChargers, we bring vehicles to life as well, and vehicle toys are an even bigger category than action figures are. So we're actually expanding the pie and the audience further. So we think the category is going to continue to grow and we're confident that we uniquely have the right strategy and capabilities to continue to lead it.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I'd like to talk a little bit about World of Warcraft. Can you talk more about the kind of subscribers by geography? What's going on in the western markets? Any metrics you can share on players or player hours with that? And I guess you're going to have an expansion pack, but what's your kind of outlook for that franchise? Can you get expansion packs to kind of not ebb and flow or kind of sustain the subscriber levels going forward? Thank you.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for the question. So we don't disclose that level of detail on subscriber engagement. But, I mean, as with all of our franchises, we think great content is what draws players in, keeps them engaged, and brings them back. That's why we've been continuing to invest in growing the World of Warcraft development team. We have now more developers working on World of Warcraft than ever before. And that's so we can continue to release high-quality content for our community and hopefully increase the pace of which we're releasing that.","The upcoming expansion announcement, I think is a great example, which we're planning to announce later this week at gamescom. Looking back at Warlords of Draenor, we were able to bring back more players than any previous expansion, taking the game back over to 10 million subscribers. So we definitely believe that there's potential to re-engage lapsed players with good new content. We also think that the Warcraft movie is a key inflection point. It's coming out next June. It's a chance to expose the Warcraft franchise's rich lore to new audiences and hopefully increase interest in World of Warcraft overall.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Cowen & Company's Doug Creutz has the next question.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little about what you're seeing in terms of pre-order interest for Call of Duty. Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Sure. First I want to reiterate what we've said a couple of times now in the past which is that, as the world moves more to digital, obviously pre-orders become really just one of the many metrics that we look at to determine momentum. So with that as a backdrop, I'll tell you that year-to-date, we're in fact significantly up on pre-orders with Black Ops III, and we expect Call of Duty to lead the industry in pre-orders again.","But more important to us than that is the wide range of other metrics that we use to look at. And from trailer views to positive sentiment to social media engagements to unaided title awareness to purchase intent, these metrics are all also up year-on-year as well. Also, as I said, we now have over 11 million monthly active users playing Black Ops II, which is unprecedented three years past the release date of one of our titles, and it shows I think a lot of momentum and a lot of hunger for \u2013 as we head into the launch of Black Ops III. So we're optimistic.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","We'll now hear from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","On Guitar Hero Live, in terms of sales expectations, is there any perspective you could provide for how we should think about this title? And looking at it from a profitability standpoint, how would you expect the game to compare to the overall corporate margin profile? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Sure, Brian. As I think you know, we don't provide specific forecasts, franchise-by-franchise, but I'll still try to answer the spirit of your question. We know we have a great game that has meaningful innovations, and everyone who's put their hands on it including both critics and fans, loves it.","Guitar Hero Live makes you feel like more like a rock star than ever before, which is a big marketable innovation. But equally important is Guitar Hero TV, which gives us a real long-term engagement strategy on this franchise for the first time. We've learned a lot of lessons here from games like Call of Duty and Destiny, which are that fans appreciate a constant stream of new content, the ability to compete with their friends online, and for the game to constantly reward them for their engagement. So we've designed GHTV with all that in mind. So it's really about more than just how many units we sell. It's also about us driving that long-term engagement. And you know how powerful that can be for our business when we achieve that.","And also we're expanding the addressable audience by making the game available on mobile. And we've made a significant investment in both the product development to make sure we have a great game. And we're making a significant investment in the marketing to make sure that we have a great launch. So those should be two good indicators for you. We believe that this can be a significant contributor to our business in the coming years.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Moving on to Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So recognizing what's still early in the launch, I was hoping you could discuss where you are with the players, and more specifically, the paying players for Heroes of the Storm. Also are there any regions of the world where player engagement is more significant than others and maybe you could draw any similarities, if possible, to what you saw in the early days of the release of Hearthstone?","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Okay. It's tough to draw any meaningful comparison to Hearthstone just because the pricing model and game players are different. I think I would say that looking at the game's reception performance globally, we're very happy with the reaction and reception around the world. We did just launch the game in June, so you're right, it is still very early. I think if you look at other games in the genre, they all had more gradual growth of their player base so that is what we would expect to see with Heroes of the Storm. We think that, in this genre eSports is a big driver, and we've already started with our major eSports initiatives underway with our Road to BlizzCon, and so we would expect that eSports will continue to be a driver for us in terms of engagement and growth of the game.","So right out the gate, we're very pleased with the positive reception from players and press. We're going to continue evolving the game, adding content on a frequent cadence, and we think we're well on the way towards Heroes becoming another key pillar in the portfolio.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Eric, on Destiny, you mentioned the engagement being very high with the game and pre-orders for the expansion seem to be quite strong as well. Can you help us, by putting into perspective how large this expansion could be relative to a typical games expansion pack and if you can compare the amount of content that comes in a certain game versus other packs? Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Sure, Colin. It's hard to compare to other games expansion packs with Destiny in such an unusual game, but the short answer is compared to our own past expansion packs, it's significantly bigger than the other expansion packs we've had, but still smaller than an entirely new game. We're calling it a mega expansion for a reason. But that's just The Taken King and I want to emphasize that equally significant to our plans for Q4 is the legendary edition, which includes the original game, both the expansion packs thus far and The Taken King, and it's just $60. So this probably represents the most game play you can get for $60 anywhere in the industry this holiday and we're doing that very deliberately because \u2013 both because we want to bring in new fans and it's a great value for them, but it's also the right thing to do for the community, because it's a shared world game and we want to keep the largest number of players possible playing together with the same content, so both strategies are equally important to our launch this Q4.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then maybe as a quick follow-up, obviously, a nice beat on digital revenue side. Can you talk a little bit more about trends on the digital side of the business and how we should expect that to track over the remainder of the year? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Colin. Thanks for the question. Yeah, obviously digital was a great \u2013 we had great momentum on digital in the first half of the year and we expect, obviously when you look forward for the first time, more than 50% of the company's sales will come through digital channels this year which is an important milestone and obviously with a great digital growth of 27% in Q2. We're well on our way of achieving that. There's a couple of buckets in terms of that that are really important. The first is obviously full game downloads, where on the Blizzard side of the business we already see most of \u2013 the majority of that volume being digital. Now we are starting to see on the console side more of our AAA share moving digitally. We've seen high teens in the past and that can sometimes spike in weeks depending upon how deep a title is in its catalog lifespan. So that's growing very, very nicely and we expect that to continue to grow this holiday.","But, another important area for us, in that you really see reflected in our results so far this year is digital add-on content sales. So think of that as content and services that we sell to our players once they're already playing one of our games. And these are things like advanced supply drops or map packs in Call of Duty, or card packs in \u2013 or tokens in Hearthstone or paid character boost in World of Warcraft. And our teams are getting more and more creative about finding ways to use these tools to drive further engagement. And this is actually the largest and fastest growing segment of our digital business, which had sales in this area growing at over 56% year-over-year or 73% at constant currency, so very, very strong momentum there. And we think that these add-on content sales are super important, because they provide not only opportunities for ARPU expansion and nice margins, but can expand and deepen gameplay and engagement with all player base, so overall strong trends of momentum for this and heading into the back half of the year.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great.

With me today are Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; and Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of our SEC filings, including our 2013 Annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC, and those indicated on the slides that is showing.","The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on the information available to the company as of the day of this presentation.

Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation.","There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary sheet.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Activision Blizzard delivered better-than-expected first quarter results. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated $772 million in revenues, with a record 68% of those revenues coming from digital channels. We had record operating margin of 31% and record earnings per share of $0.19.","During the quarter, we generated strong cash flow and as a result, repaid $375 million of our term loan. As of March 31, we have nearly 0 net debt, and in a little over -- a week from now, on May 14, we plan to pay our highest dividend ever of $0.20 per share.","Our success in the first quarter is due to the remarkable talent and relentless commitment to excellence of our employees around the world. Their efforts align with our long-term strategy and operating discipline, continue to produce industry-leading creative and commercial results.","We have some of the most valuable entertainment franchises and online communities in the world and we plan to expand our portfolio in 2014 with some of the most innovative new games from both Activision Publishing and Blizzard Entertainment.","Life to date, Call of Duty remains the #1 franchise on the new PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, which is important as we grow our online communities on these growing platforms. Last Friday, we revealed Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which is being developed by Sledgehammer. This is the first Call of Duty game that we built on a 3-year development cycle and we're now into the first full year of the console generation. We wanted to ensure that one of the most valuable franchises in all of entertainment has the very best graphics, most engaging story, great new play mechanics and is incredibly fun to play.","Life to date, Skylanders continue to lead the toys-to-life genre, which we created, and in the first quarter, Skylanders SWAP Force, including toys and accessories remain the #1 franchise in North America and Europe combined.","A few weeks ago, we revealed Skylanders Trap Team, the newest installment that will expand on the magic of bringing toys-to-life, letting kids pull characters out of the digital world and into the physical world by capturing them in magical traps. They can then send those villains back into the game to fight for good. We're very excited about the prospects for Skylanders Trap Team, which probably is the best of all the Skylanders games that we've made to date.","On September 9, Activision Publishing plans to release Bungie's highly anticipated game, Destiny, which we expect will become our next new $1-billion franchise. Destiny takes place in the shared online universe filled with other players. It's seamlessly social, but it has the pace and excitement of an action game. Pre-orders for the game are tracking towards setting an industry record for a new franchise.","Blizzard also has the most ambitious product plan in its history. World of Warcraft continues to be the world's largest subscription-based MMORPG and ended the quarter with approximately 7.6 million subscribers.","We've expanded the game's development team to accelerate content delivery, including expansions, while continuing to raise the bar on quality. As of today, I'm pleased to announce that pre-purchases for the next expansion, Warlords of Draenor, which we plan to launch later this year, have already exceeded 1 million purchases to date. This speaks to the enthusiasm from the World of Warcraft community for the exciting release that we have planned later for this year.","During the quarter, Blizzard also launched 2 new titles, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft. In its first week, the Diablo III: Reaper of Souls expansion sold through more than 2.7 million copies worldwide and during the quarter, was the #1 PC game in both North America and Europe. Blizzard intends to release Diablo for PS4 later this year.","Additionally, on March 11, Blizzard launched its new free-to-play game Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft. And with the early success, it is on-track to become Blizzard's first new franchise since World of Warcraft. Hearthstone already has registered over 10 million PC players across all regions with strong engagement and monetization. The game launched on iPad in April and quickly occupied the top spot for iPad downloads and also became a Top 10 grossing iPad game in numerous countries around the world, including the United States. Blizzard plans to release versions for iPhone and Android phones later this year.","Lastly during the quarter, Blizzard generated strong revenues through Battle.net with the launch of Hearthstone in iPad, Blizzard had now expanded Battle.net beyond PCs to the fast-growing tablet community, which represents a tremendous future opportunity for Blizzard.","As we look ahead, we're deep in development on 2 ground-breaking free-to-play titles that are designed to leverage our committed and passionate player community in new directions.","As we've talked about before, in partnership with Tencent, we'll be bringing Call of Duty to China in a format specifically for the Chinese market on the PC and as a free-to-play game. Blizzard is also developing Heroes of the Storm, which taps into a blooming genre with free-to-play online team brawler with characters from StarCraft, Diablo and the Warcraft universes.","Overall, 2013 was a transformational year for both the industry and our company. In the near term, 2014 and beyond, we expect to build on those changes. We have plans to launch 4 great additions to our franchise portfolio. These new additions show a balance of growth and diversification initiatives. Destiny is based on all new intellectual property, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm leverage existing characters from proven franchises for new modes of gameplay and Call of Duty Online takes an existing franchise to a new geography with a new business model.","Each of these 4 is designed to capitalize on emerging audience opportunities and to leverage the tremendously engaged and connected communities we have built around our franchises. We plan to deliver on the tremendous creative and commercial promise of these new initiatives, even as we push our existing beloved franchises to new heights, including, as I'd mentioned, some of the best contents we've ever created for World of Warcraft, Skylanders and Call of Duty.","In short, we're well-positioned to build on our past successes and emerging industry trends to continue to deliver great games for our fans and superior returns for our shareholders as we have for almost 1\/4 of a century. Now Dennis will discuss our performance and our outlook for the future.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results and then our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2014.","Starting with our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for a full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year, unless otherwise noted.","For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.1 billion and operating margin of 38% and EPS of $0.40. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we generated revenues of $772 million, including a record high 68% from digital channels which drove a record Q1 operating margin of 31% and record Q1 EPS of $0.19. Our strong performance was driven by 5 distinct franchises, highlighting the increasing breadth and depth of our portfolio.","Blizzard Entertainment produced record results, including strong sales of the Diablo III: Reaper of Souls expansion, better-than-expected Hearthstone card sales and World of Warcraft subscriptions. Additionally in Q1, we recognized revenues from portion of the price paid for the pre-purchase of World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor expansion, which included a character boost that is immediately playable upon purchase. During the quarter, we also recognized revenues for standalone character boost, which were sold separately.","In addition, on the Activision Publishing side of the house, Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders SWAP Force were the 2 top games in North America and Europe combined. Finally, we also saw some strength in our low-margin European distribution business due to better-than-expected next-gen console sales.","Turning to the specific P&L line items, please note all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q1, GAAP product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 36%, and operating margin was 38%. GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense was $53 million and our GAAP tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP weighted average share count was 720 million. And for EPS purposes, we also include 17 million of participating securities for a fully diluted total of 737 million.","On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 24%, operating expenses were 45% and operating margin was a Q1 record, 31%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 33% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 25%. Our Q1 results were higher-than-anticipated due to better-than-expected operating performance in an amount about equal to our non-GAAP over-performance and our recently identified forecast miscalculation with regard to deferred revenue recognition in our previous GAAP outlook, which accounted for the balance of the GAAP over-delivery.","In terms of cash flow, in Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $257 million, operating cash flow of $136 million and free cash flow of $99 million. We also repaid $375 million of our term loan in February. And next week, on May 14, we plan to pay a $0.20 per share cash dividend or approximately $143 million to shareholders of record on March 19.","Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had approximately $4.3 billion in cash and investments, of which over $800 million was held domestically, with total debt of $4.37 billion and net debt of only $73 million. Our net debt to trailing 12-month non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA ratio is nearly 0.","In summary, Q1 was a solid start to the year for Activision Blizzard, but please note that of the $0.10 of the first quarter non-GAAP EPS over-performance against our February outlook, approximately $0.06 was due to timing as we pulled forward some revenues from future quarters from revenue recognition from character boost included in the Warlords of Draenor pre-purchase program and also from delayed OpEx spending that will hit future quarters.","Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q2 and for 2014. For Q2, we have no major product releases planned. In addition, as we have seen historically, we would expect to see declines in World of Warcraft worldwide subscribers in the quarters leading up to the launch of the expansion, when players then typically return to the game. In Q2, we also expect to begin to ramp in sales and marketing spending for our 4 major releases in the back half beginning with the September 9 launch of Bungie's Destiny. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $910 million, product cost of 26% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $52 million, a GAAP tax rate of 22%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 745 million and EPS of $0.22.","For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $600 million, product costs of 26% and operating expenses of 63%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 37% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.01.","In Q3, we expect the release Destiny, which we think will be the biggest new video-game IP launch in history. However, we expect limited operating income in the quarter from Destiny as we will incur significant marketing and development expenses consistent with launching the property of this scale. We will also be ramping our spending ahead of our other large Q4 launches.","In Q4, we expect to launch Skylanders: Trap Team on October 5 and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on November 4. And for planning purposes only, our outlook assumes a Q4 launch for World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor's expansion.","In 2014, we also plan to continue investing in new properties with long-term potential in the fast-growing free-to-play segment, including Activision Publishing's Call of Duty Online for China and Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm. But as we said on our last call, revenues from these games are not factored into our 2014 outlook.","Now to our 2014 numbers. For 2014, on a GAAP basis we, expect increased revenues of $4.22 billion, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 52%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $210 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.89. The increase in our GAAP outlook for 2014 is the result of our actual Q1 GAAP performance, which was higher than our prior Q1 GAAP outlook for the reasons I've previously cited, as well as our current expectations for the remainder of the year.","For 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect increased revenues of $4.675 billion, product cost of 25% and operating expenses of 43% and an operating margin of 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 25%. For the year, we are raising our full year outlook by $0.01, and we expect record non-GAAP EPS of $1.27.","As I mentioned earlier, we had Q1 non-GAAP EPS upside of $0.10, of which $0.06 was due to timing. And although we're excited about the next-gen console ramp, we are taking a more prudent approach to the balance of the year due to continued pressure on current-gen software demand, and given that about 3\/4 of our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook is expected to be generated in the holiday quarter.","In summary, Activision Blizzard's expanding portfolio of industry-leading franchises delivered better-than-expected financial results and record non-GAAP EPS during Q1. Looking to the back half the year, we expect to launch the strongest line up in our history. In all, during 2014, we plan to deliver 6 major properties across our Call of Duty, Skylanders, Destiny, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Diablo franchises. We expect each will set new benchmarks for online playing innovation, while also further broadening and diversifying Activision Blizzard's portfolio across platforms and geographies. We expect that each will contribute non-GAAP revenues in excess of $100 million, which should drive non-GAAP digital revenues, record full year non-GAAP earnings per share and strong cash flows.","Now I will turn the call over to Eric Hirshberg to discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. I'm going to start my remarks by talking about the console industry overall. The next-gen console transition continues at a record pace, with Sony recently announcing over 7 million units sold through worldwide for the PS4, and Microsoft announcing 5 million units sold in for the Xbox One. Both of these milestones were achieved faster in this cycle than in comparable points for the PS3 and the Xbox 360 in the last console cycle. This is, of course, good news for our business. Both platforms offer faster computing power, richer graphics and more compelling online social experiences, which play directly into our strengths as the industry's biggest creator and publisher of AAA games.","Second, both platforms improve the consumer experience of buying digitally, which we believe, over time, will increase our high-margin digital business. However, this transition to the next-gen platforms will take time.","In the interim, we've seen industry software sales decline year-over-year, particularly on current-gen hardware, and the current-gen versions of our own games have not been immune. In spite of that, Activision Publishing has delivered another quarter of industry-leading performance and is set up for success throughout the rest of this year.","In Q1, in particular, including toys and accessories, Activision Publishing had the top 2 titles in North America and Europe combined. Skylanders SWAP Force is #1 and Call of Duty: Ghosts was #2. Call of Duty, of course, remains the #1 selling franchise life-to-date on the current-gen PS3 and Xbox 360 consoles. Importantly, though, Call of Duty: Ghosts also continues to be the #1 selling title on both next-gen consoles life-to-date, an important achievement as we establish Call of Duty as the first person action game of choice for the next-gen.","Skylanders SWAP Force also had a strong quarter, remaining the industry's largest toys-to-life title. The franchise overall have now had sales over $2 billion with over 175 million toys sold through and has more new characters and toys rolling out this quarter than ever before.","These are great accomplishments, but we are taking nothing for granted. We continue to see new competition entering the toys-to-life genre that we created and we remain committed to continuing to lead the category with even more breakthrough innovations to captivate our young fans. To that end, we recently revealed our next installment of Skylanders franchise, Skylanders: Trap Team, developed by Toys for Bob, the originators of both the franchise and the genre. It would have been easy to make Skylanders 2.0 simply by adding more characters, but instead we chose to keep innovating because we believe success in this genre is built on making kids say wow. With Skylanders: Trap Team, we're no longer just letting kids bring their toys to life inside the game, now we're letting them pull their toys out of the game as well. The game's core innovation allows players to battle villains on screen and then pull them into the physical world by capturing them in magical crystal traps. Once trapped, a player can release the villain back into the game to fight on their side so you can capture evil and unleash good. As one reviewer said, \"It's a simple yet genius idea combining traditional play with clever tech to accomplish what every child has dreamt of doing with their favorite toy.\" Consumers seem to agree as our reveal zone for Trap Team is off to a faster start with millions more views than any reveal trailer in the franchise's history. We're confident that this installment of Skylanders, which is to launch October 5, will, once again, redefine what's possible at the intersection of physical and digital play and expect it to, once again, be the must-have gift of the holiday season.","Looking ahead to the end of the second quarter, we're excited for E3, where we will showcase 3 AAA tentpole franchises: Destiny, Skylanders and Call of Duty. As mentioned in previous calls, Destiny has been in development for over 4 years, the next Skylanders game has the most of a significant innovation since the franchise's inception, and this year's Call of Duty game benefits from our first-ever 3-year development cycle on the franchise. As a result, 3 of the most anticipated, most innovative and highly polished games in the industry will be on display in the Activision Publishing booth. We plan to launch Destiny in the third quarter and we expect it to be the biggest new IP launch in video-game history and over time, to become Activision's third $1-billion franchise. Our partner, Bungie, is creating a truly epic game that combines the speed and digital thrill of a great first-person multi-player action game, with the depth and character development of an MMO and RPG, culminating what we believe would be a new industry-leading genre, the shared-world shooter.","I'm excited to share that we believe preorders for the game remain on a record pace for new IP. We look forward to showing you more at E3 with our great partner, Sony, to our public beta later the summer and to having you join the Destiny universe for yourself on September 9.","In Q4, on November 4, we also plan to launch our next entry into the Call of Duty series, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. As many of you know, the reveal trailer we released last Friday used footage captured from the Xbox One. I'm pleased to share the reveal was so popular that it made the top slot on YouTube's U.S. homepage and has already received more views on the first 3 days of its reveal than Ghost did in its first week. As Bob and I both said, Advanced Warfare is the first Call of Duty game to benefit from a 3-year development cycle, allowing us to introduce both more innovation and more polished content at this point, pre-launch than any previous Call of Duty game. With a great new AAA studios, Sledgehammer Games at the helm, our first 3-year development cycle, a truly next-gen graphic experience, new core mechanics and a little help from Academy Award winner, Kevin Spacey. We're optimistic this could be one of, if not the best, Call of Duty game yet.","Over the long term, Activision continues to work to expand our portfolio with carefully selected list of growth initiatives. Call of Duty Online for China is one of our most important. And I'm proud to say that the game play looks great and that our development is going well. With our strong partnership with Tencent, we're more excited than ever at the prospects of this project. We look forward to sharing more with you on this and our other initiatives in the near future.","So in closing, Q1 was another industry-leading quarter for Activision Publishing. We're excited about our ability to continue to lead the industry through the console transition and by our incredible 2014 slate led by Destiny in September, Skylanders in October and Call of Duty in November.","Thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime","Thank you, Eric. Blizzard Entertainment kicked off 2014, with a busy and record-setting quarter. We closed out March with record revenues and operating income for any Q1 in Blizzard history. Our success was fueled by the launch of Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, presales from World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor and the official launch of Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft on Mac -- on Windows and in Mac. In addition, we also kicked off initial alpha testing for Heroes of the Storm, our upcoming free-to-play Hero products. The Reaper of Souls launch was the definite highlight of Q1. The game sold through 2.7 million copies as of the first week alone making it the top-selling PC game of 2014 so far, based on the internal estimates and reports from key distribution partners. The press reaction has been extremely positive and players are really enjoying the new contents and features, such as Adventure Mode, that enhance replayability. We attribute a lot of the game's access to a focused effort, by listening to player feedback and making improvements to the game based on that feedback. The result was a smooth global launch, as well as strong sales and ongoing engagement.","Looking ahead, we're already working on a content update that will add new features, like [indiscernible], where players can unlock increasingly more difficult dungeons for greater rewards. We also expect to launch the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition, which will bring the Reaper of Souls content to console later this year.","On the World of Warcraft front, we ended Q1 at approximately 7.6 million subscribers, slightly below the prior quarter. We also began taking pre-sales for the next expansion, Warlords of Draenor. We've seen strong interest in the pre-sale offer with more than 1 million sold so far, and believe that the included character boost played a role in motivating players to make an early commitment to Warlords of Draenor. Players who participated in the pre-sale were granted immediate access to a character boost to level 90, which is part of the Warlords of Draenor package. Character boosts are also available under separate service. The boost make it easier for players to return to the game and rejoin their friends or to just try out a new class. We believe that Warlords of Draenor offers a compelling package for players. The story takes Warcraft back to the setting of some of the original games, reintroduces classic heroes and villains. Warlords of Draenor also includes the innovative new garrisons feature, which allows players to further customize their experience in the game. Each player's garrison acts as a home base. It allows players to leave a personal footprint in the world, tailored to their taste and gameplay preferences. Overall, we're pleased with the ongoing stability in the player base, but look ahead cautiously given the seasonality and a late-expansion cycle dynamics. We expect to launch Warlords of Draenor in the back half of the year.","Moving on to Hearthstone. The game officially launched on Windows and Mac on March 11 and it's currently one of the top-rated iPad and PC games of 2014 on Metacritic.","At the time we launched on PC, more than 10 million players had already tried Hearthstone. More have joined since we launched the iPad version a few weeks later, and the game quickly climbed to the top of the free app chart in dozens of countries. While it is still too early to talk specifics about the impact of the iPad release, we're very pleased with the response we received and are excited to expand Blizzard's reach to the iPad. We were also proud of the fact that Hearthstone offers a seamless cross-platform experience. The progress, collection and friend list remain the same across all platforms, allowing players to enjoy the game easily on both PC and iPad. Hearthstone's pace and design make it ideally suited for the tablet format. Matches are quick, generally around 10 minutes, and concepts are easy to grasp for newcomers, while maintaining enough depth for long-term competitive play.","Looking ahead for Hearthstone, we plan to release a new single-player adventure called The Curse of NaxxramaS this summer. This content is based on a popular raid dungeons in World of Warcraft. Players will be able to face off against card versions of classic boxes from the dungeon and unlock new cards. The Naxxramas content will be released over several weeks. To celebrate the launch, the first set of content will be free for a limited time, while the subsequent ones will be unlockable through in-game gold or real money. We're thrilled to bring the first new piece of new content out for Hearthstone this summer and look forward to creating more content for this growing community.","Rounding out a busy quarter for us, we began a technical alpha test for our upcoming team brawler, Heroes of the Storm. Heroes will be our second free-to-play game, giving our spin on a very popular game genre. Players can choose from dozens of iconic Blizzard characters, team up with friends and take on other teams in competitive online matches. The technical alpha currently includes U.S. players and select global press and community influencers. Early feedback has been very positive, with many media talking about Heroes' unique gameplay design, which is tailored to be more welcoming for newcomers to the genre. That fresh game -- that fresh take on gameplay, combined with the appeal of Blizzard's popular characters has generated a lot of interest in the game. At a recent showing at PAX East, players waited up to 2 hours to try the game and came away with very good impressions. We're steadily adding more content and features over the course of testing and we look forward to expanding the test audience globally in the coming months. In addition, our partners at NetEase and Asiasoft have announced that they're working with us to bring the game to China and Southeast Asia, respectively.","Summing up, we had a great start to 2014, with major achievements across a range of different franchises. Now that Hearthstone is officially released, we have active communities across 4 different games, including World of Warcraft. Diablo III and StarCraft II. Heroes of the Storm is in testing and will become Blizzard's 5th active game, all tied together on Battle.net. And we just recently updated the Battle.net app with chat functionality making it easier than ever for Blizzard gamers to stay in touch no matter which game they're playing. We're working very hard to carry the momentum from Q1 throughout the year, and cap off with our biggest BlizzCon yet in November. Tickets go on sale tomorrow and this Saturday, so don't miss out. We're working on more games and game contents than ever before, and the future is really bright for all Blizzard gamers.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Eric, I was wondering if you could provide, first off, some perspective on what aspects of the next-gen version of Call of Duty will particularly be unique and stand out this year, just given the 3-year development cycle, as well as the focus on the next-gen platforms? And then secondly, just curious if the performance of recent other next-gen releases gives you any hesitation with respect to the lack of a single-player mode for Destiny?","Eric Hirshberg","Okay. I'll take your questions in order. First of all, the answer on Call of Duty is really a fairly long list. I think the answer is honestly several things. I'll just focus on a few of the most prominent. I think, first and foremost, is visual and graphic fidelity and polish. I hope you'd agree that you're seeing, even in the reveal trailer, a different level of graphic fidelity than we've had in the past. And it's our true -- first true next-gen -- pure next-gen development where we have access to the new hardware throughout the development process, unlike Ghost which was cross-gen.","Second, it's allowed us more time for experimentation, creativity and iteration in the development process. So that led to things like us adding some of the first new mechanics in core gameplay in the franchise in a long time, things like boost jump and exo strength and new mechanics, which we have also had time to test with our players to make sure that they resonate and will create a compelling and balanced gameplay. IGN, I think, just ran an article talking about 11 game changers they were perceiving just from picking apart the reveal trailer frame-by-frame. So there's a lot of new ideas in it.","And then third, it allowed us more time to put more emphasis on story and character. And you could see that in the trailer, too. We hope that the villain character being played by Kevin Spacey soon to become iconic. And also, you're seeing really state-of-the-art facial capture and animation. That's a full performance capture technology that we revealed last year at GEC. We've got some great acclaim from the 3-year cycle. It allowed us the time to move that from an R&D effort into real gameplay.","As far as your question on Destiny, I think that the framing of your question actually plays to one of Destiny's strengths, which is that it does have a single-player experience, and it has multiple different ways to play the game. So we're not putting all our chips on multi-player the way some others have been offering a wide variety of content and game modes. So no matter what way you like to play, Destiny has a great experience for you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As we enter year 2 of the cycle, some of other companies in the space are seeing some operating leverage. And I -- we just wonder if you could talk about your operating leverage this year and going forward, how you see that? And are there some expense savings going forward?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. Thanks, Justin. It's Dennis here. What you generally see in the console transition is that margins compress modestly at the beginning of the cycle. You're building software for multiple platforms, installed bases are not fully grown out yet, development tools and engines are not fully mature. So there's inefficiency that comes with the early years of the console transition cycle and your investments are spread across multiple generations. As you more fully transition in the later years of this cycle and focus on the next-gen, margins expand, obviously, as the installed base grows and you get more scale out of your development and marketing efficiency. You've seen this in our financials when you look in the past couple of years, in 2012, we had peak operating margins late in the last cycle, about 34%. And then last year, you saw a little bit of compression on that when we compressed down to 31%. This year, it's rebuilding up a little bit to 32%. So we expect, over the course of this generation, for those margins to continue to expand, and particularly on next-gen with all the new business models. And then digital, you heard about the record performance in Q1. We do expect digital to continue to drive that expansion.","Operator","The next question comes from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","As we look at your R&D expense, and if I include -- if I would include the capitalized portion of that expense, now you have Call of Duty on a 3-year cycle, you've got a multi-year plan, I believe, for Destiny, could you give us a sense of how much of that R&D budget is geared for things that will see the next year, next 2 years, next 3 years with things that we see today and things that were -- that we don't yet get to see? How much spending is going towards those things in the future? And then a related question to that, how much of that investment will be on for IP that we know in the current portfolio versus new things that you have in the development?","Dennis Durkin","Yes, no worries. Thanks, Dan. Good question. I guess I'll just start by highlighting the fact that -- you alluded to this, but we have -- our whole investment model is anchored on building franchise value over time. And so we plan our businesses and our franchises with multiple-year planning horizons, constantly evaluating what we're going to build, who's building it, what the innovation is, when it will come to market, and we're really trying to build a consistent flow of content for our communities and growing franchise value over time. So with that in mind, we're always trying to managing the short, medium and longer term to make sure we're investing in innovation across each franchises, while also selectively layering in new franchises when we see big market opportunities and capabilities that we can exploit. Specifically to your question, it'll vary in any year, but generally speaking and directional for 2014, probably about 1\/3 of our total cash spend is for future games that we'll release beyond 2014. And then relative to new IP, probably about 1\/4 of our spend is on new IP on franchises like Bungie, Heroes, Hearthstone, Call of Duty Online, et cetera. So that gives you directional mix in terms of how our cash spend in 2014 lays out against sort of near term and long term, as well as existing and future IP. So appreciate the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Barclays.","Christopher Merwin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it looks like you've had a lot of early success with Hearthstone. I think you reported about 10 million users. And now that, that game has been launched on iPad, can you quantify at all for us what type of uptick you've seen in users so far and how those iPad users been converting any better than the desktop ones? And then lastly, just in terms of monetization for the games, is it possible to share what type of payer rates you're seeing for Hearthstone as compared to the typical mid-core mobile game?","Michael Morhaime","We'll we're not ready to discuss specific impact on the total player base or specifics around monetization yet. I can say that it's monetizing very well compared to other free-to-play games, at least from what I've seen. One thing to point out, since it is a cross-platform game and we have users that joined us on multiple platforms, you are seeing players that joined on the PC purchasing both on the PC and the iPad and vice versa. And so the way that we look at the ecosystem there is as really one-player base that has the ability to play on multiple platforms. And we think that judging by the rapid rise of the download popularity on the iPad charts and the positive reviews that we've been getting, we're very pleased.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","Do you think that some of the large-platform companies like Apple, Amazon and Google are going to pursue exclusive content as they try to basically build their app store market share? And how is this going to be different than what we've seen over many years for Microsoft and Sony in how they use exclusive content?","Robert A. Kotick","Yes, and they already are pursuing exclusive content. And I just think it'll add more opportunities for companies like ours that has the kind of content that they would like to have exclusively. And you're going to start to see more of that as there become more platforms available to create content for.","Operator","And our next question comes from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a couple of questions. First, I was wondering if you guys could share some thoughts on capital allocation? And then I know a bunch of questions on Hearthstone have been asked, but could you help us maybe size the market and the audience size from your perspective?","Dennis Durkin","Sure, I'll take the first one on capital allocation and then Mike and I can probably pair up on the Hearthstone market size. On capital allocation, obviously, it's been a question that's been asked with our new capital structure and our first priority is around debt service. And you can see from our recent paydown and current net debt situation being almost 0 that we're in a very comfortable position with a lot of flexibility. So we have a lot of opportunities to use that excess cash in various ways. And we've historically paid a dividend, which, as we've mentioned -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we'll pay next week a $0.20 dividend. It's up on a per-share basis versus last year, but down in aggregate versus last year due to our lower share count. So that stays on the list of our annual priorities. And then, we'll -- as we look across other uses of capital, whether it be investing in our businesses we're doing across the multiple new IPs that you see coming out in both content and infrastructure, M&A or other inorganic activities, we look at all of these with the focus of driving and increasing shareholder value as our top priority. So overall, I think those are generally the priorities that we have across the business and we'll be prudent and disciplined at how we look at capital allocation and continue to do that in the way that we think maximizes shareholder return for the long term.","Michael Morhaime","Okay, and the sort of the sizing the Hearthstone opportunity -- market size opportunity for Hearthstone. I think it's very difficult to project something like that. Certainly giving the -- given the accessibility and depth of the game, we certainly believe that there's a lot of potential. Also when you consider that we still have the Android platforms and the iPhone to expand to, we see that as a big opportunity as well. And also we're continuing to build on the game experience, listening to player feedback and adding new content. So we're really excited about the upcoming release of Naxxramas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So, Bobby or Eric, Destiny is being released at a the time of the year where we'll be competing with -- for consumer wallet share with annual iterations of franchises from your competitors, as well as perhaps new releases from others. So do you foresee this as being a headwind to initial sales, or is this apples and oranges in terms of the target customer? And from what you can tell, is the September release window more or less crowded versus years past?","Eric Hirshberg","This is Eric, I'll take that. We think we have a great window to release Destiny. More importantly, we think we have a great game. As far as the window goes, I would just remind everyone, this is the same window essentially that Grand Theft Auto had last year. So I think that fairly decisively proves that a great action game can find a huge audience during that time period and they had all the same annual competitors to contend with as we will. But more importantly, we found that whenever your launch is, if you have a breakthrough game and you have a great experience, which is sticky and novel and deep for the variety of game players, we think we have all of that and then some with Destiny that we can find a meaningful audience. So we've got a breakthrough game. We think we've got a great window and we would have competition no matter when we launch it.","Operator","The last question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Co.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Mike, just give us some details on Heroes of the Storm. And I know it's early days here, I'm not sure how much more you can share, but I was hoping you could just, if possible, kind of size maybe the market opportunity as it relates to the game category? Or maybe the Blizzard audience. I mean, you've got 10 million, looks like, PC players almost immediately for Hearthstone. Is that kind of an initial reasonable range you think for Heroes of the Storm, or is it unique that maybe it doesn't appeal to the same player base? And then maybe this is way too early, but maybe monetization of the game and also as it relates or I guess compares to what you saw from Hearthstone?","Michael Morhaime","Thanks for the question. So currently, we're in a very limited technical alpha testing, really, to test the infrastructure around the game and all the technical issues surrounding the game. It's also giving us the opportunity to test some of the game design innovations that we have been creating. And the response has been very positive. The game is already very fun. We're getting really good feedback from the people that are currently helping us test it. We're looking forward to expanding the number of -- the size of our test audience in the future. In terms of the opportunity, it is a proven genre. I mean, you can see that some of the existing games in the genre have achieved a very high level of success. We think that there's an opportunity to make the genre even more approachable for new players. I think that it can skew very hardcore, and there's definitely room for improvement in that area while still maintaining the depth and replayability that exist there. So let's see, in terms of monetization, we are still experimenting with monetization, but it will be free-to-play, we will have micro-transactions and we'll have more information about the offerings that we'll provide in the future.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Okay. Well, carry on, and thanks, everyone. On behalf of everyone at Activision Blizzard, we thank you for your time and consideration, and we look forward to seeing some of you at E3. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to Activision Blizzard's Q2 2012 Results Conference Call. Please note today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today's call over to Ms. Kristin Southey. Please go ahead.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. With me today are Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; and Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements and based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. As indicated in the slide that is showing, a number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Such factors include, without limitation, sales levels; the increasing concentration of titles; shifts in consumer spending trends; current macroeconomic and industry conditions and conditions within the video game industry; our ability to predict consumer preferences among competing genres and hardware platforms; the seasonal and cyclical nature of our industry; changing business models, including digital delivery of content; competition, including from used games; possible declines in pricing; product returns; price protection; product delays; adoption rate and availability of new hardware and related software; rapid changes in technology and industry standards; litigation and associated costs; protection of proprietary rights; maintenance of key relationships, including the ability to attract, retain and develop key personnel and developers that can create high-quality hit titles; counterparty risks; economic, financial and political conditions and policies; foreign exchange and tax rates; identification of acquisition opportunities; and potential challenges associated with geographic expansion.","These important factors and other factors that potentially could affect the company's financial results are described in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2011, and in the company's other SEC filings. The company may change its intentions, beliefs or expectations made at any time and without notice based upon any changes in such factors in the company's assumptions or otherwise. The forward-looking statements in the presentation are based on information available on the company as of the date of this presentation and while believed to be true when made may ultimately prove to be incorrect. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision in forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, August 2, 2012, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.","I'd like to note that certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; expenses related to stock-based compensation; expenses related to the restructuring; the amortization of intangibles and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill; and the associated tax benefit. Please refer to our earnings release which is posted at www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation.","There's also a PowerPoint overview which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted on the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a 12-quarter financial overview, highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results on a one-page summary sheet.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and thank you all for joining us today. We once again delivered better-than-expected quarterly results. On a non-GAAP basis, we achieved record Q2 and first half net revenues, operating income and earnings.","For the first 6 months of 2012, we had the top 3 best-selling games in North America and Europe: Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and of course, Diablo III. Having the top 3 games is an important milestone for Activision Blizzard. Our performance for the first half of the year was driven by the remarkable talent and dedication of our employees around the world, and I want to thank them for their continued commitment to excellence, which fuels our strong results.","We continue to build and enhance our diversified portfolio of great franchises. So far this year, Activision Publishing's Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure, a franchise that didn't exist 12 months ago, was the #1 best-selling game, including toys, for the first half from 2012. Additionally, Skylanders toys outsold the #1 best-selling action figure line in the U.S. and Europe year-to-date. On October 19, we plan to release Skylanders Giants, which we believe will build on the momentum with a great new game, an expanded lineup of characters and a significantly greater retail presence than we had last year. Skylanders has been Activision Publishing's most successful new IP, and we have the opportunity to grow this unique franchise across both the $80 billion worldwide toy market and the $55 billion worldwide video game market.","In addition to Black Ops II this year, we plan to broaden the global reach of Call of Duty through our recent agreement with Tencent to bring a new free-to-play, micro-transaction game to China, one of the largest and fastest growing game markets in the world. Tencent is the ideal partner for Call of Duty, and we're delighted to have Tencent and also NetEase as our partners in China.","Diablo III marks Blizzard's 14th #1 PC game launch, an astonishing record. Diablo III set a new launch record for PC games with more than 6.3 million players in its first week alone. And as Mike will tell you later in the call, there's a lot more from Blizzard this year. In fact, next up is World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria expected to launch in the U.S. and Europe on September 25. And although we've seen some declines in the player base over the past year, Mists is expected to deliver past and present World of Warcraft players a tremendous amount of new content, including storylines, levels and game modes.","In addition to new content for each of this year's 4 major franchises, our future pipeline also includes Call of Duty Online to China, as I mentioned, a new IP from Bungie, who created the Hero franchise, as well as Blizzard's StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, Blizzard All-Stars and an all-new MMORPG in the future. All of these games are deep in the development process.","We're pleased with our performance for the first half of the year, and we're very excited about our titles for the back half of the year. And while we're increasing our financial outlook for 2012, we do remain cautious given the macroeconomic uncertainty, risks to consumer spending especially during the holiday season and the recognition that the majority of our earnings will be generated in the last 6 months of the year. We'll continue to face a rapidly changing landscape in our industry and as we have said many times before, our success comes from focusing on opportunities that offer the greatest long-term growth, expansion of our global reach, and our focus on cost management. This strategy has served as well in the past and should position us well for the future.","One last note, over the past few months, there's been much speculation regarding Vivendi's intention with respect to its stake in Activision Blizzard. While we're unable to comment on Vivendi's behalf, we continue to remain focused on strong execution, the delivery of great games and the provision of superior shareholder returns as we have for over 20 years. Our strategy has served us very well in the past and will position us very well for the future.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dennis, who will review our financial performance.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll begin with a recap of our better-than-expected second quarter and first half results and I'll then cover our increased outlook for 2012.","Let's start with our results. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, strong consumer demand for our premium content and services drove better-than-expected results with revenues of $1.08 billion and EPS of $0.16. For the second quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, revenues increased 51% versus the prior year to a record $1.05 billion. Digital revenues hit an all-time high of $497 million, and operating margin increased 480 basis points to a record 28.5%, while EPS increased 100% over the prior year to a record $0.20.","Our record performance this quarter was driven by our 4 mega franchises, including record-setting Diablo III, our newest IP, Skylanders, as well as World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. During the quarter, we had the top 3 titles at retail, which underscores our ongoing commitment to our retail partners. We also had the largest subscription-based MMORPG and strong digital sales of Diablo III, which drove record digital revenue.","Turning to the specific P&L items, please note all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For the quarter, GAAP product costs were 27%, just below our outlook due to product mix. GAAP operating expenses were 52%, slightly higher than our outlook due mainly to higher G&A expenses for Activision Publishing. Finally, our GAAP tax rate was 19%.","Non-GAAP product costs were 22% below our outlook due to revenue over-performance and product mix. Operating expenses were 50%, also below our outlook due to revenue outperformance offset somewhat by higher G&A expenses. And our non-GAAP tax rate was 26%.","It was a strong first half for our business on multiple fronts and the record performance of Skylanders and Diablo more than offset subscription declines inside of World of Warcraft, lower a la carte DLC sales for Call of Duty and weaker performance in our mid-market and catalog business. Our teams are very focused on addressing each of these areas, and you'll hear from both Eric and Mike about some of the trends in our approach going forward.","Now turning to the balance sheet. On June 30, we had no debt and $3.2 billion in cash and investments or $2.71 per share. This is lower than the prior quarter due in part to the return of approximately $260 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. For the first 6 months of the year, we generated a record $245 million of operating cash flow and after capital expenditures, we generated a record free cash flow of $219 million.","The strength of our balance sheet and cash flows are major competitive advantages for us, particularly in this challenging economic climate. Specifically, they afford us the ability to invest for future growth and internal opportunities with the highest return on invested capital like Skylanders, Call of Duty Online in China and Blizzard's new MMO; invest for future growth through attractive external opportunities, such as our 10-year exclusive arrangement with Bungie; and return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","As you know, the retail market for interactive entertainment has declined, and macroeconomic concerns and weakening consumer buying patterns are making our markets more competitive than ever. With this as a backdrop, focus has never been more important. For Activision Blizzard, our 3 key priorities for 2012 remain unchanged and we are diligently focused on driving execution against the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year. To reiterate that plan, first, we expect growth from Blizzard, driven by the expected launch of at least 2 titles this year, namely Diablo III and Mists of Pandaria. Second, Activision Publishing is focused on this year's new Call of Duty title, Black Ops II, on growing online engagement and monetization and on continuing to expand and scale the Skylanders franchise. And finally, we plan to continue expanding operating margins for revenue mix and productivity improvement initiatives across multiple areas of operating expenses.","Because of our focused execution for calendar 2012, on a GAAP basis, we are again raising our outlook and expect net revenues of $4.33 billion. We expect product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 48%. We expect a tax rate of 25%, a diluted share count of about 1.15 billion that can be used in all quarters and GAAP EPS of $0.69.","For 2012, we now expect non-GAAP net revenues of $4.63 billion, a $100 million increase from our prior outlook and up versus the prior year. We expect non-GAAP product costs of 26% and operating expenses of about 41%. We expect a tax rate of 26% and a diluted share count of about 1.15 billion, both of which can be used in each of the remaining quarters. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.99, a new record.","Now moving on to the September quarter. On a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $740 million, product costs of 26% and operating expenses of 62%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 25% and earnings per share of $0.06.","For the September quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $690 million, an increase over prior year driven by our lineup, including the very late quarter launch of World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria. We expect non-GAAP product costs for the quarter of 25% and operating expenses of 59%. OpEx is up versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and marketing expenses primarily from Mists of Pandaria. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.07. EPS is in line with the prior year as our tax rate was very low last year due to discrete onetime items in the quarter.","So in summary, despite a challenging macroeconomic and consumer environment, Activision Blizzard completed the first half of the year strongly. Although we still have the majority of our major product launches in front of us, we will continue our strategy of focusing on doing a few things really well, driving quality into our game slate, building upon our strength in retail and digital, and keeping a relentless focus on cost containment. The combination of these things should position us for another record year of record non-GAAP margins and EPS in 2012.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric Hirshberg, who will discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. Hello, everyone. Today, I'll start with a brief overview of our product performance and recent strategic initiatives that now go into our pipeline.","Year-to-date, the industry has seen in decline in overall retail sales, however, the top games at retail continue to grow. For the first 6 months of this year, sales of the top 5 games in North America and Europe are up 15%, collectively, including accessories. The top 5 games were also strong in 2011. And in fact, since 2007, the top 5 games have grown revenues in average of 11% per year, and this growth does not include digital sales. So while retail is down overall, the story is much more positive for the top-selling titles, and Activision Publishing continues to drive this trend. As Bobby said, the first 6 months of 2012, Activision Blizzard had the 3 best-selling games in North America and Europe, and Activision Publishing's Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 were 2 of them.","In addition to our product performance, we've also been strengthening our online capability, starting with our move into China. We've announced a long-term relationship with Tencent to bring in all new free-to-play micro-transaction game, Call of Duty Online, to the Chinese market. China is one of the most exciting places in the world for us to grow our business. The online game market in China is estimated at $8 billion and is expected to grow at a 17% compounded annual growth rate through 2016. Today, Tencent's QQ network has over 750 million accounts. They have a terrific track record and obviously have deep market knowledge, which -- both of which will be invaluable to us.","Second, we see long-term potential for premium games on smartphones and tablets. Our recent agreements with Flurry and Swerve and the creation of our own mobile studio, The Blast Furnace, which is built around some of the industry's best handheld development talent, are building blocks of our broader strategy. You'll see us develop and release premium titles to expand and strengthen our core brands. You'll see us launch a series of free-to-play games from our rich portfolio of existing intellectual properties. And you'll see us publish third-party independent titles that build an engaged community and launch new innovative IP. We look forward to telling you more as this strategy unfolds.","Now let's move to our fall lineup, which is anchored by 2 of the most popular franchises in all of entertainment, Call of Duty and Skylanders. Call of Duty is one of the biggest entertainment franchises of all time, and player engagement with the brand continues to set new records. In preparation for the launch of this year's game, our team in Treyarch has been working tirelessly to bring our highly engaged community, Call of Duty: Black Ops II. The game had several meaningful innovations and firsts for the franchise. It strikes a great balance between taking the franchise to new places while retaining the core appeal of all Call of Duty games. The game has already generated tremendous buzz, and Treyarch has continued to track ahead of Modern Warfare 3. We're working incredibly hard with all of our partners around the world to make Black Ops II the biggest entertainment launch of all time for the fourth consecutive year. Call of Duty Elite will also be supporting the multiplayer experience in Black Ops II. With Call of Duty Elite, we've had historic successes combined with some important learnings. At least 2.3 million premium members and over 12 million registered users are remarkable achievements. When taken in combination with the record engagement of the Call of Duty franchise overall, there is strong evidence of tremendous continued engagement with the franchise. That said, we still feel we have a long way to go.","We've had introduced a lot of changes in behavior for our fans. One consequence is the fact that a la carte DLC sales have not performed as well as in years past. Our overarching goal is to provide all of our players with the best possible community platform. With that goal in mind, we're always evaluating ways to improve and optimize the service to create the best experience for our fans and the best return on our investment. We look forward to sharing more details on this with you in the future.","Finally, I'm pleased to say that Call of Duty: Black Ops II will give our fans the biggest and best zombies experience ever. We're very pleased with the game's development, and we expect to have many more announcements to share with you before the November 13 launch.","In addition to Call of Duty, we're also focused on driving momentum for Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and bringing Skylanders Giants to market. For the first half of 2012, including accessories, Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was the #1 best-selling console and handheld game. In addition to that, our standalone toy sales also made Skylanders the #1 selling action figure in the U.S. and Europe. Skylanders has now succeeded in both the toy industry and the interactive entertainment industry. And with the combined scale of over $130 billion dollars, there is still plenty of room for us to grow. We believe that Skylanders has the potential to be our next billion-dollar franchise. And over the past few months, we have increased capacity and believe that we'll be in a better position to meet consumer demand this year.","Our October 19, we will release Skylanders Giants. Giants will have significantly higher brand awareness and a significantly larger retail presence than we had for the launch of Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure. At top retailers, we expect Giants to have more than 100,000 linear feet of shelf space, which will give the title one of the biggest and best in-store presences of any video game. In addition to significantly more retail presence for the game itself, Skylanders will also be present throughout stores this holiday due to our significant licensing partnerships, which we think will both be accretive to the brand and to the bottom line. It will be a huge launch. The game itself will feature 8 giants which are almost double the size of regular Skylanders, 8 LightCore Skylanders that light up in the game and in the real world, 8 all new Skylanders and 24 updated characters from Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure. And the good news for parents and kids is that all of the characters from the original game are compatible with Giants, with their abilities and upgrades intact. Our team at Toys for Bob has done an amazing job. The game is looking great.","Looking beyond this year, we're very excited about releasing new content for the Skylanders and Call of Duty franchises, bringing Call of Duty Online to China, continuing to grow our mobile business and launching Bungie's new game and universe, just to name a few. Overall, Activision Publishing continues to focus on our biggest and most promising growth opportunities and, as Dennis said, doing a handful of things exceptionally well. I'm looking forward to sharing more with you as the year progresses.","And now I'll turn it over to Mike Morhaime, who will update you on Blizzard Entertainment.","Michael Morhaime","Thanks, Eric. We've been very busy at Blizzard since the last call. Q2 2012 was Blizzard's best quarter ever from both a revenue and a profit standpoint. Much of that success was fueled by the record-breaking launch of Diablo III. And we're excited to welcome so many new players to the Blizzard community. As a matter of fact, about 16.9 million players logged in to Battle.net during the past month to play Diablo III, StarCraft II or World of Warcraft.","The Diablo III launch shattered PC game sales records, including fastest selling PC game ever. To date, more than 10 million copies have been sold, including the 1.2 million copies sold through the WoW Annual Pass. While Diablo III is our 14th #1 seller, we did experience some challenges. Due to the unprecedented influx of players, a number of service issues arose that we needed to work around the clock to address. The vast majority of these issues were ironed out within a couple of weeks of launch. As I mentioned in a letter to players recently, we're not satisfied with just breaking launch records. We want people to play and enjoy Diablo III for a long time. We've already made a number fixes and updates including the activation of the auction house, which provides a convenient way for players to trade items with each other. The Diablo team has also been working on improvements to end game reward and having a player-versus-player mode, which we hope will enhance the value and longevity of the game.","On the World of Warcraft front, we ended Q2 at about 9.1 million subscribers worldwide. This figure is down from the 10.2 million we reported at the end of Q1, with the majority of declines at the quarter coming from the East. Historically, we have seen usage decline towards the end of an expansion cycle. We saw a similar drop in subscribers in the months before Cataclysm, followed by a substantial number of returning players around the Cataclysm launch. We're also seeing that a number of players took a break from World of Warcraft to play Diablo III.","As I have mentioned in the past, continuing to deliver compelling new content is critical for the long-term engagement with an MMO like World of Warcraft. We are very excited to have recently announced that Mists of Pandaria, our next expansion, will be released on September 25. In addition to the World of Warcraft players that have been eagerly awaiting the release of this upcoming expansion, there are a surprising number of Diablo players that have never tried World of Warcraft. We believe that Mists of Pandaria includes some of the highest-quality content that we've ever created for World of Warcraft. Between the new areas to explore, player race, character class, dungeons and game modes, we believe that Mists of Pandaria can appeal not only to players looking for more content, but also to those who are looking for different ways to enjoy the game. The new scenario mode offers a pick-up and play field for small groups who want more casual ways to adventure together. Challenge mode offers a great deal of replayability for hard-core competitive players. And pet battles should appeal to players who enjoy collecting pets with some lighthearted competitive elements added on.","Another thing I wanted to point out is that we're offering a new Digital Deluxe version of Mists of Pandaria. This new option will give players who want the mount, pet and other digital goodies from the collectors' edition a chance to get those items and still enjoy the convenience of direct download. The collectors' edition will remain available exclusively at retail.","We'll continue building excitement for Mists of Pandaria in the coming weeks as we work hard towards a successful launch. Preorders are off to a good start in this very early stage, and the ongoing beta test has yielded positive, valuable feedback that we're using to tune and parse the game as we head into release. We're also hoping to make a splash at the GamesCom show in Germany later this month, where we will debut the opening cinematic to Mists of Pandaria.","In addition to Mists, we'll also be showing the multiplayer version of StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm at GamesCom. Back in June, we showed the expansion at Major League Gaming Spring Championship in Anaheim, which was the largest e-sport event ever in North America. More than 20,000 spectators came to the event and had a chance to try out Heart of the Swarm. Another 4.7 million unique viewers tuned into the event via MLG's online broadcast, where we showed off some exclusive trailers for Heart of the Swarm. We received tremendous feedback from that event, and we're looking to head into beta very soon.","Aside from working on the expansion, the development team just released the arcade update for StarCraft II. This is the biggest update we've made to StarCraft II since the game launched, and it includes improvements to the user interface, the custom game editor and the entire custom game system on Battle.net. Historically, the custom games that the community has created with our game editors have contributed greatly to the longevity of our strategy games. We are hoping that the new arcade update will result in more awesome community-traded games on our platform.","Before I finish, I want to briefly comment on eSports, specifically our StarCraft II World Championship series. With the help of our partners, we've been running StarCraft II eSports events in 28 different countries and regions around the world over the past few months. The best players will compete at the Battle.net World Championship event in Shanghai in November. This event will be an eSports Olympics with talented players representing multiple countries around the world. Our hope is that excitement around eSports can help drive continued interest in our games.","In summary, the record-breaking launch of Diablo III has given us great momentum into the back half of 2012. We still have a lot of work ahead of ourselves as we continue to support our Diablo players, get ready for the Heart of the Swarm beta and prepare for the launch of Mists of Pandaria. With all of our major franchises finally together on Battle.net and great new games in the pipeline, the rest of the year and beyond is looking very exciting at Blizzard.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call back to Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thank you. Operator, you can now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from James Hardiman, Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Just a quick question on the guidance here, you beat the second quarter, your own internal expectations by $0.10. You're only raising the year by $0.04. Similarly, on the top line, I think you beat by $200 million plus. You only raised by about $100 million. How should I think about the guidance for the back half of the year? Were there some shifts in some of your assumptions as you work your way through the year?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. This is Dennis speaking. I think, as you heard in my remarks, in this market environment, we think that being prudent is the best path. And I think that's what we've done with our guidance, and we've done that for many years as a company. There are obviously some headwinds that we've seen in terms of FX, and those are things that we're trying to put inside of our guidance. But overall, we feel good about our lineup. But obviously, it's a very choppy market with a lot of uncertainty in it. And we're just focused on executing and delivering the 3 titles that we have in the plan.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","But just a quick follow-up, if I may, just from an industry prospective, obviously, given your small number of high-quality titles, you guys probably have less general industry exposure than most of your competitors. But can you give us an idea of what you're assuming for packaged good sales for the year and how that compares to your previous expectations?","Dennis Durkin","Yes. We don't give specific guidance relative to the packaged good market. I think what you've seen overall, as Eric alluded to in his market, that more share is going to the biggest titles. What you see is -- and so that's kind of just a general trend, which has obviously benefited us because we have some of those largest titles. I think when you also look at that, we are late in the console set life cycle. And so you've seen year-over-year declines in -- particularly at retail. Digital, as you've seen inside of our numbers, are still very, very strong. So consumers are still consuming in whatever way they find to be the most convenient. Our experience, though, is that if you build great, high-quality experiences, the consumers will show up. Diablo III was the perfect example of that.","Robert A. Kotick","And the thing that we are seeing is that retailers are putting the most support behind our titles and the biggest titles, generally.","Operator","Our next caller is from Robert Baird & Co., Colin Sebastian.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, Mike, maybe could you talk a little more in detail about the marketing and advertising program for Mists of Pandaria? Is that going to be broad-based, focused maybe a little bit more on Asia? And is that mostly online? Or are you going to look at traditional channels as well?","Michael Morhaime","I think that what you'll see is similar to our past expansions, where we really have gone big and broad. So you'll see both online and television. We think that there's a big opportunity both in the East and the West. And so we're really looking to make this a big global event.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","But maybe as a follow-up, the real money auction house, any more detail you can provide on sort of progress and velocity? It seems like that's potentially another good platform opportunity for you guys.","Michael Morhaime","What I can say about that is that in terms of usage, it is in line with our expectations, in terms of how that is performing. Players are definitely making use of it. We'll continue supporting it and making updates to make sure that it continues meeting their needs. We aren't going to be providing projections or forecasts regarding that specific segment of the business, though.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Mike, I wondered if I look at subscription revenue number and I adjust for Call of Duty Elite and this $11 million accounting issue, it looks like the ARPU on Warcraft was down substantially more than the sub loss, which is a little confusing given that you just said most of the sub losses were in the East, where the ARPU is lower. So I wonder if you could sort of help me reconcile those 2 things.","Michael Morhaime","I'll let Dennis take that one.","Dennis Durkin","Sure. When you unpack essentially the sequence, I think you're referring to the sequential quarter-over-quarter decline in subscription revenues. I think you need to unpack it just a little bit, where about half of it does come from the subscriber decline. I think the other half relates to several other things, which I'll list right now. One is the $11 million that you mentioned, which is a onetime noncash adjustment, accounting adjustment. The second is, in Q1 we had some of value-added services and an amount that we didn't have in Q2, so again stripping that piece out. And there was a little bit of a modest impact for new Annual Pass members who joined during the quarter so that when you strip out kind of the last 3 things, the actual subscriber -- subscription revenue decline is actually more in line with the subscriber decline.","Operator","And a question now from Daniel Ernst, Hudson Square Research.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","Two questions if I might, but they're related. So forgive me. Bobby, big picture. The game industry was down 30-something percent in the first half of the year. Clearly, you're not. You're actually up 13%, benefiting from that trend of gamers going towards the best titles out there. But I wondered if you could comment, as someone who\u2019s through pretty much every home console cycle, what you think is driving it. Is it simply that we're in the seventh year of the cycle? Or are we seeing any signs of gamers leaving sort of the hobby and moving to other things. And then a related question. Where -- in the current cycle where the Wii brought in a lot of gamers who hadn't been there before, my in-laws, senior citizens, people were playing Wii games and Tiger Woods golf and it was just fun. Everyone was doing it and people have left that. The industry then chased after Facebook gaming, which is now under significant pressure that we've seen from Zynga and EA acknowledging that and everyone\u2019s now sort of pushing towards mobile as the place where you can go capture gamers who aren't really gamers and might spend a little money with you. Is that sort of a false hope, do you think? Or do you think there's still an opportunity to expand the market beyond the people like kids that love Skylanders and hard-core gamers that love World of Warcraft and Call of Duty?","Robert A. Kotick","I think it's all your in-laws' fault. I would say a couple of observations. First of all, you have a very difficult macroeconomic environment. If you look at the things that we look at that can have an influence on the consumption of entertainment, generally unemployment data is very concerning. And you look at what's happening in Europe. And there are a lot of challenges that we see that are going to continue to affect the macroeconomic outlook. I think that we are at the late end of the cycle and the late end of the console cycle is always going to have its share of difficulties. I think you have had, unfortunately, a stream of products that are less than adequate from some of our competitors and I think the demands and the expectations in the marketplace for great quality products. And if you look at the success that we're having, it validates that there is an opportunity for great quality products, but I think where we are in the console cycle makes it more challenging for anything other than great quality products. I think there's a lot of competition for entertainment dollars. You look at mobile games. When you see what's happening there and where pricing is there, that's had an impact. And I think the other thing that we've seen is that games like Call of Duty or a lot of the other games that we make and play are multiplayer games that offer a lot of replayability. And when you have the opportunity for replayability in an economic environment like we're in, you're going to spend more time playing the games that you have that give you an unending amount of replayability. So I think there are whole host of factors that contribute. I will say this, when you look out over the next 5 years, there's a lot of reasons to be hopeful and enthusiastic, but the next few years are going to be challenging.","Operator","Our next question is Eric Handler, MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","First on World of Warcraft, are you projecting that we could see a release in Mists of Pandaria in China in the third quarter? Is that more likely a fourth quarter event? And then also, do you think -- can you just talk quickly about the tail for Diablo III and as it competes with users with -- for the new Mists of Pandaria update, how you're thinking about continuing to monetize that game.","Michael Morhaime","Okay. So with respect to China, our goal is to launch Mists of Pandaria in China as soon as possible and really close the gap between the launch in the rest of the world and the launch in China. Of course, we still don't have approval. So I can't provide a release date at this point. But hopefully, that's going to be a much smaller gap than we've seen in the past. That probably still moves it out of Q3. With respect to Diablo, I think that -- what we've seen in the past with Blizzard games is that they tend to have a very long shelf life, and we hope to continue supporting and selling that game for a very long time. I think that there is an opportunity created by bringing new players into the Blizzard community, and we hope to -- that some of those players will try out other Blizzard games in World of Warcraft.","Operator","Let's go to Edward Williams at BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a quick question, looking at Call of Duty in China. Can you give us a little bit of color, Eric, maybe on what steps we have to get through from here to there in terms of between now and the release of it? And then also, how should we kind of think about this product in terms of what the potential economics of it might be in terms of maybe some visibility on a revenue split or just some kind of context around the potential economic impact of that?","Eric Hirshberg","Well, in terms of the steps between here and the launch, it's very similar to what Mike just mapped out on Blizzard titles. We obviously are still in development. We made our announcement, but we're still developing the game and then we still have to gain the approval of the government to release it. And we're going to be doing a beta as well. So there are still several steps between now and release. In terms of the economics, we can't discuss any particulars in terms of the agreement. However, as I've said in my comments, we're a partner with the leading company in China in this segment. They have tremendously strong track record. We have, I think, a game that will be very differentiated for what the Chinese gaming community has experienced in the most popular segments, being first-person shooter. So we're very bullish about the opportunity.","Operator","Our last question comes from Brian Karimzad with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have 2 quickly, actually. So on Call of Duty China, your net\u2019s set in place, but how about the idea or the process of micro-transaction-based Call of Duty in other regions in the West? What's the decision tree there and kind of what are the milestones you need to get through before that becomes a possibility? And then I have a follow-up for Dennis.","Eric Hirshberg","I think we look at the Call of Duty Online game in China on its own merit as a great opportunity. That's not to say that we won't gain learnings about how it works in the micro-transaction-based format for the game. And there are a few other regions where that would be very relevant. So -- but we certainly are not ready to announce any plans in that regard.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Dennis, from a cash flow perspective -- free cash flow perspective, this company is more like one of the global media companies than it is like a traditional video game publisher, and the capital return to shareholders has also been more like that than a traditional video game publisher. I guess the missing element is leverage, which is present on those. And I know there are some constraints with your parents. But if you kind of back that out and you just think about your view of where the business itself fundamentally will be over the next 3 years or so, what's your sense of comfort with leverage?","Dennis Durkin","Right. I don't think we're going to go into a hypothetical exercise about how the company might be restructured or anything relative to balance sheet. I think when you look at the past and you alluded the fact that this has been a very shareholder-friendly company in terms of returning capital to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends, and it's our goal to continue to drive a lot of cash flow inside the business, which will give us the flexibility to do other things, both returning capital to shareholders and thinking about other investments that we can make inside the business. As we've said, we think that strong balance sheet is a very strategic aspect for us. And we're going to continue to try to make it as strong as we possibly can.","Robert A. Kotick","And Brian, I'd say just one comment on comparing us to traditional media company. I don't know of any traditional media companies that have our operating margins or return on invested capital.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Okay. Well, on behalf of everyone at Activision Blizzard, we want to thank you for your time and consideration and we look forward to speaking with you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's conference call.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today's call over to Ms. Kristin Southey. Please go ahead, Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Good afternoon, and thank you, for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment; and Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, including the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of our SEC filings, including our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC, and those indicated on the slide that is showing.","The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.

In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a 1-page summary sheet.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and good afternoon, everyone. We've never produced as much great content in 1 year as we have in 2014. In terms of entirely new franchises, we successfully launched 2 major franchises, again, adding to our content portfolio, which includes some of the most valuable franchises in any medium.","Launching franchises that appeal to global audiences requires inspired creative talent, commitment to innovation, business and process discipline, best-in-class execution, long-term focus and significant capital resources. Our unyielding commitment to excellence resulted in launching Destiny as the most successful new IP in gaming history, and Hearthstone now has over 20 million registered users. This year, we're delivering some of the best content in our company's history for some of the world's strongest and most recognizable entertainment franchises, including Skylanders TRAP TEAM and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls. We remain committed to delivering the best quality entertainment experience to our audiences. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is the most ambitious Call of Duty released to date, and Blizzard's Warlords of Draenor is on track to be a great success.","We expect to deliver double-digit non-GAAP revenue growth, record earnings per share and strong cash flow in 2014. Most importantly, we continue to deliver to our audiences the types of experiences that they love and expect, while strengthening and expanding our franchise portfolio. I want to thank all of our employees as well as the amazing team at Bungie for their extraordinary talent and dedication. Their incredible commitment, inspired creativity and operational excellence continues to produce world-class experiences for our players and world-class performance for our stakeholders.","As entertainment continues to evolve, demand for great premium content is only increasing. We have a more than 20-year track record of creating some of the world's most iconic entertainment brands with some of the largest and most engaged player communities in the world. Over the next few years, we'll continue to expand our franchise portfolio and to invest in our rich franchise library.","Blizzard's Hearthstone exemplifies this. Blizzard brought iconic World of Warcraft characters to a digital card game, optimized for PCs, tablets and soon mobile devices around the world, with free-to-play access for our audiences. In the next year, we expect to release 2 more new free-to-play franchises: Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm and Activision's Call of Duty Online, and both are designed for new platforms, new regions, has new genres and new audiences.","As much as we've achieved, we're only at the beginning of what we believe is a new era for Activision Blizzard. Our opportunities have never been greater and I've never been more excited than I am now about our future.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q3 financial results, our outlook for the fourth quarter and our increased outlook for 2014.","Starting with our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for a full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated better-than-expected results, with revenues of $753 million and a loss per share of $0.03. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we generated better-than-expected and record results, with revenues of $1.17 billion, including 43% from digital channels and record Q3 EPS of $0.23, $0.12 better than our previous guidance.","During the quarter, we successfully expanded our content portfolio with the launch of Destiny, which generated better-than-expected non-GAAP revenues of over $500 million and achieved non-GAAP profitability in the quarter. In addition to Destiny, Call of Duty and Skylanders drove the Activision Publishing business. And we saw strong contributions from Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft; Diablo III; and Hearthstone's first expansion, the Curse of Naxxramas.","For the first time, 6 major franchises contributed during the quarter, highlighting the increasing breadth and depth of our expanding content portfolio with recurring revenue streams.","Within our 6 franchises, we saw strong digital demand in subscriptions, paid extra content, value-added services and full-game downloads. For Destiny and Diablo III on console, full-game downloads drove a high-teens percentage of total console volume.","Through September, on a year-to-date basis, we generated non-GAAP revenues of over $1.15 billion from digital channels, up 25% year-over-year. Obviously, the migration of our business to digital is happening rapidly, and we expect this trend to provide long-term operating benefits in the future.","Turning to specific P&L items. Please note all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. For Q3, GAAP product costs were 28% and operating expenses were 71%. GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense was $51 million. Our GAAP weighted average basic share count was 718 million.","On a non-GAAP basis, for the quarter, product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 53% and operating margin was better-than-expected at 22% due to higher revenues and the timing of expenses.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17%. Please note that about half of our Q3 overperformance was due to the timing of revenues and expenses.","In Q3, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $280 million, which we define as non-GAAP operating income and then add back depreciation. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 24% in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow.","Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, we had over $3.8 billion in cash and investments. We held over $550 million of that amount domestically.","In summary, Q3 was a record quarter for Activision Blizzard, driven by the record-setting launch of Destiny, the resurgence of World of Warcraft subscribers and our increasingly broad and diversified portfolio, which generated strong digital demand across multiple titles, platforms and models.","Turning to Q4. Our major launches include Activision Publishing's Skylanders TRAP TEAM, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Destiny's first expansion; as well as Blizzard Entertainment's upcoming World of Warcraft expansion, Warlords of Draenor.","Now let's discuss the numbers. In the December quarter on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of approximately $1.5 billion, product costs of 31% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million; GAAP tax rate of 23%; and EPS of $0.28 based on a fully diluted weighted average share count of 748 million shares, including participating securities.","This share count can be used for both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter. For the December quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $2.2 billion, product costs of 27%, operating expenses of 32% and an operating margin of 41%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.86.","For the full year 2014, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $4.33 billion, product costs of 28% and operating expenses of 48%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $203 million. We expect our GAAP tax rate to be 21%, with GAAP EPS of $0.91.","For full year 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.8 billion, up over 10% year-over-year; product costs of 26%; operating expenses of 42%; an operating margin of 32%; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%, resulting in record non-GAAP EPS of $1.35, $0.06 higher than our prior outlook.","In summary, we expect 2014 to be a record year. And as always, we remain laser-focused on execution, while keeping a keen eye on costs, all of which should deliver long-term growth, strong margins and cash flows for our various stakeholders.","Now I will turn the call over to Eric Hirshberg to discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. I'm pleased to announce that we delivered a record Q3, posting the largest Q3 revenues and operating income in Activision Publishing's history. Destiny led the charge in September as the biggest new franchise launched in video game history. In fact, Destiny is one of the top 10 U.S. video game launches of all time and the only new franchise launch to ever crack the top 30. But even more important is the player engagement we've seen since launch. We have over 9.5 million registered users, and players are averaging over 3 hours of game play per day.","Other key engagement metrics like how often players return to the game, peak concurrencies and the depth of use across all modes of play are amongst the best we have ever seen for any of our games. A critical reason for the success is the incredibly talented development team at Bungie, which not only created the world's first shared-world shooter, but has also listened to community feedback since the launch and has implemented scores of improvements. We see Destiny as a living universe, which our community is actively helping to shape.","Players are already asking for new content. And on December 9, we plan on satisfying that demand by launching our first expansion pack, The Dark Below, with all-new maps, missions, gear, weapons and a brand-new raid. Work has also begun on future expansion packs as well as on our next full-game release. We're very pleased with the launch and continuing engagement, and we'll update you on our progress on future calls.","Moving to Skylanders. This year's game, Skylanders: TRAP TEAM, launched on October 5 and adds to our streak of innovation in the toys-to-life category, which we created and continue to lead. Critics, fans and retailers agree, with the TRAP TEAM receiving the largest retail shelf space and support and the most positive review sentiment in franchise history. I'm particularly excited about the tablet version, where for the first time we've enabled the full console experience to be available on hundreds of millions of tablets worldwide. As one perfect review-score said of the tablet game, \"There haven't been sacrifices. There haven't been stumbles. This is a console game that you can play on your tablet instead of your TV, and it's flawless.\"","We are the only kids' video game to make the holiday top toy list from Toys\"R\"Us, Target, Toy Insider, National Association of Parenting Publications and to appear on many more.","Skylanders as a franchise has now sold over 200 million toys and continues to outsell the #1 best-selling action figure line in North America and Europe for the third consecutive year. We think we once again have created the must-have gift for the holiday season, and the TRAP TEAM will help us increase our lead as the #1 franchise in the category.","Now let's move to our third and biggest tent-pole franchise: Call of Duty. Yesterday, we launched the Day Zero edition, a special 24-hour early access SKU with additional digital content for our most dedicated fans. And our day one sales began this morning at midnight. While it's obviously too early to predict the game's ultimate sales performance, we're very pleased with our initial Day Zero results and were emboldened by a number of key indicators.","Advanced Warfare was the most preordered game of the year and so far has the highest game ranking of the last 3 Call of Duty titles. Furthermore, our quantitative research shows purchase intent numbers that are well above last year's at this time. And Nielsen's unaided first choice, Call of Duty leads the industry. We expect that Advanced Warfare will go on to become the biggest game of the year, the most digitally purchased game in console history and the largest next-gen title in history and all of those by wide margins.","Our highly acclaimed internal studio Sledgehammer Games has brought significant innovations across every game mode, a great story and dramatically improved graphics. And our upcoming season of digital content will offer players more than ever before. This is the first year out of -- of our 3-year development strategy on the Call of Duty franchise, and we feel that strategy has paid off with Advanced Warfare and will continue to pay off in years to come.","Finally, let's discuss Call of Duty Online in China. I shared in August that we had just entered large-scale beta testing with our partner Tencent. We have now successfully passed every development milestone, and we now plan to launch unlimited access beta testing in Q1 2015, which means the game will begin monetizing throughout China. Call of Duty Online is a major opportunity to expand our reach and build what may be our largest player community with year-round revenues. We look forward to sharing more about it in the coming months.","So in closing, Activision Publishing had its biggest third quarter in history, and now looks ahead to a fourth quarter with 3 tent-pole properties that we expect will continue to lead their respective categories along with a fourth soon to launch next year in China, serving the largest gaming audience in the world.","Thanks, and I will turn it over to Mike who will talk about Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime","Thanks, Eric. Blizzard Entertainment enjoyed a strong quarter, on the strength of returning World of Warcraft subscribers and the launches of Diablo III Ultimate Evil Edition for consoles and the Curse of Naxxramas adventure for Hearthstone.","World of Warcraft subscribers were up 600,000 to a worldwide total of over 7.4 million at the end of the quarter, driven by excitement for the upcoming Warlords of Draenor launch and the release of that expansion's opening cinematic. The East-West mix of subscribers stayed about the same, remaining within historical ratios. Returning subscriber trends remained strong. And we're also seeing increased engagement in recent weeks, thanks to the recent launch of the pre-expansion content update. This increase in players gives us great momentum as we head into the launch of Warlords of Draenor next week. The China launch will follow as soon as possible, pending government approvals in that region.","Diablo III Ultimate Evil Edition launched in August on next- and current-gen consoles with better-than-expected sales. The reviews have been stellar, and the game remains one of the top-rated titles to date on next-gen platforms. We also released a large update that offered new game content for players to explore and collect as well as new features to enhance replayability. That update was well received and helps to bolster ongoing engagement with the game.","Hearthstone also had a big quarter with the release of the Curse of Naxxramas adventure. The community responded with great enthusiasm to the single player encounters as well as the new cards. More than 20 million players have now played Hearthstone, while eSports tournaments around the game are also growing more popular than ever. Recent Hearthstone competitions have surpassed 150,000 concurrent viewers on online streams.","Similar to our other franchises, the key to ongoing engagement in Hearthstone is new content, and our developers are already working on a full expansion that will include over 100 new cards. We've also announced that the game will be coming to Android tablets before the end of the year, with Android phones and iPhone versions to follow.","Heroes of the Storm, our upcoming hero brawler, continues to evolve and improve in testing. We believe that the inclusion of Blizzard's recognizable characters as well as design innovations that make Heroes easy to learn will attract players to our game. We've now entered the final phase of technical alpha testing, where we've made significant progress building out our back-end infrastructure. This means that we're ready to greatly expand our worldwide base of testers and drive towards closed beta, so solid progress on that front.","And finally, I want to remind everyone that BlizzCon, our massive gaming festival, takes place in just 3 days at the Anaheim Convention Center. I hope you'll be able to join us at the show or follow along online. We expect this to be our biggest and best BlizzCon ever. I will be sharing tons of exciting news as well as holding huge eSports competitions across many of our games, including World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, StarCraft II and a special exhibition for Heroes of the Storm.","We're proud of the results we've posted this quarter and believe they're indicative of the success we've had in expanding our portfolio of games. With Hearthstone, Diablo and World of Warcraft launches this year, Blizzard now supports vibrant and active communities across a wider range of genres and platforms than ever before. Additional exciting opportunities are in the pipeline as well, including Heroes of the Storm and Android and iPhone for Hearthstone. It's an exciting time to be a Blizzard gamer, and we look forward to celebrating with our players this Friday at BlizzCon.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call over to Thomas.","Thomas Tippl","Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call for Q&A, I'll take a moment to summarize the 3 key takeaways from today's call. First, Destiny's unprecedented success and the resurgence of World of Warcraft player engagement drove record third quarter results and led us to again raise our outlook for the year. We are on track for double-digit revenue growth and record EPS in 2014.","Second, this year, we've successfully expanded the portfolio of blockbuster franchises that we own or control with both Hearthstone and Destiny far exceeding expectations, and we are launching some of the best content we have ever created for our established franchises.","And third, we have never had a larger, more diversified or more promising global product pipeline, which includes several new games, targeted at some of the fastest-growing market segments, beginning with Call of Duty Online for China in Q1 of 2015, Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm and a number of other unannounced games in development.","Digital growth trends and our plans to expand into new geographies, new platforms and new business models position us well for long-term growth and increasing profitability, which we expect will allow us to continue to deliver superior shareholder returns, as we have for over 20 years.","And now, we'll take a few questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Chris Merwin at Barclays.","Christopher Merwin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it's great to see that Warcraft subscribers grew again in the 3Q, and that's even before the release of Warlords of Draenor. Is most of the subscriber growth there to date attributable to new users signing up? Or is that mostly old users returning to the franchise because of the character boost that you introduced? And Mike, I think you mentioned that the net adds in 3Q are pretty evenly split between East and West. Do you expect to see any mix shift change in the upcoming quarter?","Michael Morhaime","Thanks for the question. So much of the resurgence comes from returning players, many of whom already have strong connections to the game. We've been focused on making it easier for players to return. And I think the character boost really plays a big role in that, helping people quickly get up to speed with their friends and also catching up with all the changes we've made to the game over the years. The growth that we've seen has been proportional to historic ratios between the East and the West. And we don't make predictions about subscriber growth in the future, but we're feeling very good about the expansion launch next week.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Drew Crum at Stifel.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So as it relates to Destiny, could you comment on the remaining capitalized software associated with the game and what the implications are for profits? And I guess, on a related note, you mention in the press release, 9.5 million registered users. Is there a way to tie that back to the sell-through on the game to date?","Dennis Durkin","Eric, do you want to take the second question. I'll come back to the software amortization?","Eric Hirshberg","Sure. Well, first of all, I think by any measure, Destiny is off to a great start. As I mentioned, we were the largest new franchise launch of all time. And despite the large investment, which Dennis will talk about -- or maybe because of that large investment, we were able to be profitable from day one, and we think it's only a matter of time now before it becomes our next billion-dollar franchise. I also mentioned some pretty incredible engagement numbers. The average player is investing over 3 hours of game play per day. And to date, we have over -- we have 9.5 million registered users. Of course, there's a relationship to sell-through. It's not exact because some people have more than one identity. But obviously, that's directional. So it's a highly engaged audience that is hungry for more content, and we've had that. We think we've been good at providing them with more content to satisfy that demand, which we're planning on doing on September 9 with our first expansion pack. And I also mentioned that we are also already underway on our next full-game releases. So we've got a great pipeline of content, a great plan, a great development partner with Bungie, and we're very bullish on Destiny.","Dennis Durkin","Right. And then just to the second -- I guess, the first part of your question relative to software amortization and profitability, as Eric mentioned, even with the significant launch, marketing and product amortization costs, which we took in the quarter, Destiny was profitable from day one on a non-GAAP basis, which is just tremendous collaboration, I'd say, between the Bungie team and the Activision Publishing team. Regarding product development costs and amortization specifically, for non-GAAP, the vast majority of the capitalized development costs for -- up to the launch were amortized in Q3. So there's only about 15% of the final development cost left to be amortized over the next few quarters. So we think it provides a great opportunity for profit growth in the coming years.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Colin Sebastian at Robert W. Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. Question on Hearthstone and the success you've had to date with the title and the pricing model. I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on the strategy to continue driving the user base higher as well as monetization, for example, through content enhancements or expanding onto other platforms. What's in store for that franchise?","Michael Morhaime","Yes. I think there are 2 main points. The first is with respect to platform expansion. So we already announced that the Android tablet version of the game will be coming in December, and we are working on Android phone and iPhone versions that will come at sometime after that. We're particularly excited about Android, especially as it relates to China and Korea, where Android is the dominant mobile platform. Our developers are really busy right now working on our new expansion, and we're very encouraged from what we've seen when we launched the Naxxramas adventure, how important new content can be to engagement in the game. And so those are the big areas where we are focusing right now, and we'll continue to add content and features to the game as time goes by.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Arvind Bhatia at Sterne Agee.","Hearing no response, we'll go to Stephen Ju at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Eric or Dennis, can you give us some additional color on the mix of digital versus retail for next-gen versus prior-gen hardware? What are you seeing the consumer opting to do? It seems like given that Microsoft and Sony have made this relatively easier, the trend for, presumably, an increasing mix from digital should continue over time.","Dennis Durkin","Right. Thanks, Stephen. At a macro level, obviously, the consumer trend towards digital downloads on full games, we think will be a nice margin tailwind for us over the next few years. Recently, the experience that we've seen in terms of digital mix, as I said, in my prepared remarks on consoles for new games like Destiny and Diablo has been in the high teens, and that's really a capability that only really launched last year for new release titles. So it's a pretty rapid rate of adoption. And we've seen initial positive trends on Advanced Warfare. But due to the size and sort of mass audience of that game, we'd expect sort of lower digital mix on a title of that size and scale. Next-gen systems, as you point out, due to their high connection rates, improved transaction capabilities, early adopter profiles, have a higher propensity for digital purchases than previous generation systems. So overall, we expect this part of the business to grow rapidly, as the next-gen installed base continues to grow, and consumer buying patterns continue to embrace the convenience of this distribution model. In the long term though, like we've seen on the Blizzard side of our business, we'd expect this to be the majority of our sales mix over time. But at the end of the day, it will be consumers who decide how fast that transition ultimately takes place.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Pitz at Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Question for Dennis, a follow-on to the download question. Can you quantify the impact of gross margin, if a user is essentially downloading a game instead of buying it at a retail store? And maybe just a second one for Dennis as well. On console sales, obviously, doing a little bit better this year than maybe people would have thought, plus you've got Microsoft's $50 cut. How has that impacted your thoughts going forward and in terms of units for hardware?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. Yes. I think -- obviously, I'll answer your second one first relative to console sales. Clearly, both -- we have 2 very, very strong platforms that have gotten out of the blocks significantly faster than last generation. Both are very committed to winning. And obviously, I think the last price cut that Microsoft just announced last week in terms of the $50 heading into the holidays is only going to be a nice tailwind to further make that transition happen faster. So we're very excited about that. And the attach rates that we've seen have been solid. The flip side to that is the current-gen systems and the tail on the current-gen system, I think, has been equally aggressive in terms of the decline. So that is a little bit of a headwind that we face relative to that transition when you have games as significant in size as ours. On the digital point, relative to digital margins, obviously, the price point is relatively equivalent relative to consumer price points, whether it's physical or digital. And we end up sharing with whoever the platform provider is the percentage of sales to compensate them for effectively the transaction, and that's usually about a 30% cut that the first parties end up taking. On the PC, obviously, in the Blizzard side of our business, that's just direct. There is no sort of intermediary in between that. So it's obviously very accretive to margins over time.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Daniel Ernst at Hudson Square.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","I'd like to follow up on your commentary on Call of Duty Online in China and what you might expect from that. So how long it will take to go from the beta in Q1 to full commercial launch? How long kind of till it hits its commercial revenue stride? And are you still expecting this to be on a scale similar to CrossFire in terms of revenue potential?","Eric Hirshberg","Sure. So as I mentioned we've now successfully passed all the required development milestones and we've seen very strong engagement statistics from Chinese consumers. And we plan to launch unlimited access beta testing in Q1 2015, which means we'll start monetizing throughout China early next year. So of course, free-to-play games like the one we're making take time to build revenue and expand their audiences. Fortunately, our partner Tencent has one of the strongest track records out there. As for your specific question on ramp-up time, you can look at games like CrossFire and League of Legends to see how large, successful microtransaction games in China ramp up. It takes some time. But ultimately, it's worth that, if you have a great game, which we think we do. So we think Call of Duty Online is a major opportunity to expand our reach in a new region. Over time, may become our biggest player community with consistent year-round revenues.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Justin Post at Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So far, we've heard a lot about digital really helping performance in the industry. I'm wondering if you could talk about the opportunity for Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone to really help the revenue mix towards digital and towards Blizzard? And how meaningful are these products to EPS like this year and next year? Can they help move the needle?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. Justin, it's Dennis. Thanks for the question. Both Hearthstone and Heroes share the attributes, as you point out, of being highly digital; and if they scale, high margin recurring revenue business models. So we're very optimistic about the opportunity for both of them. But let me parse them individually because they're at slightly different phases of development. Hearthstone, as Mike spoke to in his comments, has obviously been a commercial hit this year with more than 20 million players, strong engagement, monetization, et cetera. And so it's a strong contributor this year. And the 2 key drivers for that success on an ongoing basis are really going to be about the platform expansion that Mike spoke to in the content releases. So we think we can grow on that next year and continue to expand the opportunity as it relates to that franchise. Heroes is obviously a more nascent part of the development curve, currently just approaching beta. So we don't have an outlook yet for Heroes to share. But given the popularity of the genre and the digital business model, we're optimistic that it can become a significant contributor over time. So we both -- we think that they both present a great opportunity for us in 2015 and beyond. So thanks, Justin.","Operator","And we'll go back to Arvind Bhatia at Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you can maybe talk about Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare day one performance a little bit more, maybe directionally if you're not prepared to talk about numbers yet, and maybe what the learnings are so far from this one in slightly more detail.","Eric Hirshberg","Well, I think the first directional comment we'll make is that we think we have a great game, and that's probably the most important thing. As you know, this is our first 3-year development cycle, which is an important strategic shift we made in terms of the approach. Our first new lead developer in a decade, new innovations that we embrace and champion across every mode of play. And we think those decisions have paid off. As far as performance, as I said before, day one started at midnight this morning. So unfortunately, it's obviously too early for us to tell. But here's what I can tell you: We were pleased with the results of our Day Zero edition. Purchase intent is meaningfully up versus last year. There's great positive sentiment from reviewers. Positive sentiment from consumers on social media is also up. We think we've got great buzz overall on the game. And Advanced Warfare was the most preordered game of the year and leads Nielsen's unaided first choice across the industry. We also have some trends in the console transition working in our favor with a lot of next-gen consoles that we open during the holidays. Call of Duty has historically high attach rates to the next gen. So we think that we'll have strong sell-through as the next-gen installed base ramps up towards the holidays. So all in all, we expect that Advanced Warfare will go on and become the biggest game of the year based on a lot of positive momentum and a lot of positive indicators, most important one being that it's a great game.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Todd Mitchell of Brean Capital.","Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Not to belabor the point, but everybody's been asking about digital. I was wondering if you could just get more specific in terms of the breakdown by type or by platform or even by property. And can you kind of size some of these initiatives, the free-to-play initiatives, and talk about their relative contribution margins?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. Thanks, Todd. Yes, very popular topic and one that we're very excited about just based on the, obviously, consumer trends that we're seeing and obviously the margin trends that it has inside of our business. As I mentioned, our digital business is growing rapidly across the portfolio, with both secular and sort of consumer trends fueling that growth. For the first 9 months of the year, our overall digital revenues grew by 25% year-over-year and represented nearly 60% of our business, so obviously, a very solid high margin recurring tailwind there. There's 3 buckets of digital activity that I'd really call out. The first is full-game downloads, sort of for front-line software. And actually this is the smallest bucket percentage-wise of our digital business but one of the fastest growing as the base is small, particularly on console, and that transition takes place. The second bucket relates to new business models that we've used to drive engagement and monetization inside of our large online communities, and this is actually the largest bucket. And so these are things like downloadable content for Call of Duty, value-added services for World of Warcraft, microtransactions for Hearthstone and Call of Duty. So these add-on sales are obviously very high margin and very good drivers of engagement inside our very, very large communities, and so that's obviously growing incredibly fast. And then the last bucket that I'd call out is really relating to subscription revenue, and that largely relates to World of Warcraft and it's a large recurring revenue stream on PC, really directly correlated to the overall subscriber base. And recent subscriber trends, particularly in the West, will be helpful, as this -- as that stream stabilizes with the new launch of Warlords of Draenor. So when you go back to kind of the original point that we're growing at 25% and that third bucket being subscriptions, which has been sort of flat to slightly down over the past year or so, those first 2 buckets are really growing at rates higher than that, which kind of gives you the blended rate of 25%. But across the portfolio, a very strong tailwind for us both into this holiday and through next year and beyond.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Neil Doshi at CRT Capital.","Neil A. Doshi - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Mike, can you talk a little bit about how we should think about World of Warcraft subscribers, post the launch of the game? And given now that you've been testing the free-to-play with Hearthstone, can you talk about down the road if we could potentially see free-to-play come to World of Warcraft?","Michael Morhaime","Okay. Well, let me take the second part of that question first. So I don't foresee any dramatic changes to our business model in World of Warcraft. We do currently provide the first 20 levels of World of Warcraft completely free. So anybody is able to try those out. But after that, it is $15 a month in the West. With respect to our -- how to think about subscribership after launch, we don't provide specific numbers or forecasts, as you know. But what I can tell you is that typically, with expansions, we do get a boost in players and engagement when we launch a new expansion. This time around, we have taken steps to make it easier for players to return to the game and quickly get up to speed with changes that we've made to the game since they may have left. And I think that, that will help us with win backs. We're already seeing positive signs that it's working. We have updated the player models in Warlords of Draenor and have really freshened the game's look and feel. We've added the new Garrisons feature that allows players to create a home base in the world. And we're hoping that these improvements will help players feel more ownership and attachment to the game and will make it more fun for them to stick around following the expansion.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from Eric Handler at MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Battle.net question for you. With the expanding volume of Blizzard content over the last year, I'm just curious how beneficial the Battle.net platform has been in cross-promoting studios' games and driving greater utilization and maybe even time spent playing those games. And is there any way to put a dollar value on that?","Michael Morhaime","I think it's very hard to put a dollar value on it. But what I can say is the Battle.net platform has always been a very important communication tool for us in keeping our players informed about new updates to our games as well as new games, new expansions that we're coming out with. I think it's not only important for Blizzard's ability to communicate with our players, but also has been really important to allowing our players to communicate and keep in touch with each other across our portfolio of games. And so I think that, that is a very powerful cross-promotional tool and it does lead to very tangible results when we launch major new releases.","Robert A. Kotick","So thank you, all, for joining the call. We appreciate the questions and the support, and we're looking forward to a terrific rest of the year and to being in touch with you again at our next conference call. If you have an opportunity to participate in BlizzCon either through the live stream or in person this weekend, we think you're going to find it very interesting and exciting.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thanks, everybody.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Amrita Ahuja. Please go ahead.","Amrita Ahuja - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's third quarter 2017 conference call. With us are Bobby Kotick, CEO; Coddy Johnson, COO; and Spencer Neumann, CFO. And for Q&A, Dennis Durkin, Chief Corporate Officer; Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.","A number of things could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings, including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and those on the slide that is showing.

In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary sheet.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Amrita. This was another strong quarter. We delivered record results and exceeded our prior outlook. Our audience is among the largest of any platform and this quarter, we achieved a new milestone for daily time spent per user of over 50 minutes, which is in line with some of the most engaging online connected platforms in the world.","We remained focused on building enduring franchises over the long term and helping to grow strong and highly engaged communities around them. When we focus on serving our communities and investing in new ways to help people connect with our franchises and each other across many different types of content and platforms, we create opportunities for delivering growth across reach, engagement and player investment.","A great example of this is BlizzCon. Tomorrow, the 11th celebration of the Blizzard community kicks off in Anaheim, California. This is one of the highlights of the year for the company as BlizzCon exemplifies how our games bring people together from all walks of life and all parts of the world.","Gaming through events like BlizzCon provides players with a true sense of belonging and a recognition that through our games we can help break down the barriers that seem to be dividing much of the world. Over the next couple of days, over 30,000 people will join us from around the globe, with millions more joining virtually including via the live stream and our virtual ticket. The attendance and viewership are great examples of the incredible passion of the Blizzard community, whether hosting esports championships, unveiling epic cinematics, offering compelling new game play experiences and consumer products, or simply providing a space for players to connect. BlizzCon reflects the scale and diversity of the broader opportunities open to the company today.","We remain excited about our growth prospects, many of which are progressing quickly. The launch of the Overwatch League begins with regular season play on January 10, and we believe 2018 will be the year that esports becomes even more broad in its appeal.","This morning, we announced large Overwatch League sponsorship deals with both Hewlett-Packard and Intel. And these are two great examples of forward-thinking initiatives by two important companies that will help us deliver a great experience for the community and invest in the future of the League.","Our employees across Activision Blizzard and King continue to be recognized for their commitments to excellence and execution. We were named to the Fortune 500, Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For and Fortune's Most Admired companies. This quarter, we're proud to have been recognized in the top 10 of Fortune's first-ever Future 50 list, which recognize the world's most innovative and forward-looking companies.","Marrying vision and creativity with consistent execution over the long term has always been the blueprint for our success. And we're going to keep working hard to approach our future with the same discipline. We're very grateful for the support of all our employees, our player communities, our partners and our stakeholders and shareholders in this effort.","And now, here's Coddy to review the highlights of our operations this quarter.","Collister Johnson - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Bobby. 2017 continues to be a record-setting year. We surpassed last year's high watermark for year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record revenues in Q3 and we outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue and by $0.13 on non-GAAP EPS.","Given this over-performance and the confidence we have in our plans, we are raising our outlook again, for the year. Our performance is made possible by our incredible teams whose commitment to delivering creative and commercial excellence, engages our communities and enables our company to grow.","I want to highlight, in particular, that in Q3, our teams demonstrated two important aspects of our strategy. First, the ability to serve our communities with a broad range of experiences, large and small across full games, expansions, content drops, features and services. And second, the ability to drive meaningful results from those investments.","We saw this from Activision and Bungie with launch of Destiny 2, a major new game for the franchise, which is now the biggest console release for the year in the U.S. We also saw see this from Blizzard with Hearthstone's Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion, built upon iconic characters and lore, which became a franchise's best-performing expansion to-date.","And we saw this from King with Candy Crush where continuous ongoing feature and content updates allowed this franchise to have its largest quarter since 2013 and return to the number one position in the U.S. app store.","King's Q3 performance is worth underscoring for a moment. They reclaimed their number one mobile publishers spot in the U.S., they grew revenues for the third sequential quarter to the highest level seen in 10 quarters, and they achieved record mobile gross bookings.","King did all of this by focusing on the player experience and the live titles and by increasing the pace and success with which they release content, services and feature updates.","Let's now dive deeper into our first strategic pillar, audience reach, which was 384 million monthly active users this quarter. Activision MAUs were a Q3 record of $49 million driven by launch of Destiny 2 and continued strong performance by the Call of Duty franchise, which helped Activision achieved record Q3 segment revenue and record Q3 operating income.","Destiny 2 is off to a strong start and after the PC launch is now ahead of Destiny 1 on total consumer spend, on time spent per player, attach rate to the expansion packs and average revenue per user. Destiny 2 also achieved a new high watermark in digital full game downloads at over 50% of console sell-through. And last week, we introduced Destiny to PC gamers for the first time, opening up the franchise to new global audiences and future growth opportunities.","We were thrilled to launch on Blizzard's Battle.net platform where we have an end-to-end connection with consumer and can drive enhanced player experiences, better insights and better company economics.","The Call of Duty franchise had a record Q3 MAUs providing even more momentum around tomorrow's highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: World War II. We're enthusiastic about the return to the gritty, authentic, boots-on-the-ground gameplay that the franchises is known for and innovations like war mode and a brand-new take on Call of Duty Zombies. The game is great. Pre-orders have been strong with a higher digital mix than prior Call of Duty titles and sentiment is running high among the community.","As we've said before, we think Activision has the right game at the right time and a complete package for gamers all over the world. Call of Duty has been the number one console franchise worldwide for seven of last eight years. We expect to continue that streak this year.","Blizzard also set a Q3 record for reach with 42 million MAUs driven by a steady stream of content, feature and service updates. This is now the fourth quarter in a row that Blizzard achieved record quarterly MAUs without a full game release, hiding again the strategy of continuous year-round content and services to engage our audiences and bring in new players. Notably MAUs grew year-over-year for both Overwatch and Hearthstone and the Overwatch community now has over 35 million registered players.","King's MAUs were down quarter-over-quarter to 293 million. As discussed on our last call, King has a number of initiatives underway to grow audience size but these initiatives will take time as the team rolls them out to the community. I do want to highlight King's continued success around user engagement. Live updates released this quarter led to record highs both for the frequency of which players return to play and the overall time spent per player per day. And this brings me to our second strategic pillar, engagement.","As Bobby mentioned, the company set a new milestone for daily time spent per user at over 50 minutes, placing us on par with Facebook's time per day, which is over 50 minutes across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Blizzard driven engagement with compelling content updates across much of their portfolio. Overwatch introduced new content for seasonal events, including Summer Games in Q3 and Halloween Terror last month, driving participation and customization items.","World of Warcraft released a large content update leading to stable MAUs versus prior quarter and strong participation in value-added services. And Hearthstone saw time spent rise by double-digit percentage year-over-year on the strength of the Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion. Blizzard also released a number of key updates on the Battle.net platform. As mentioned, Battle.net welcomed its first non-Blizzard game Destiny 2 on PC and ahead of that launch, the Battle.net team released a new mobile app and a strong collection of social features in a desktop app, enabling players to stay connected both inside and outside their games and across devices.","Our groundbreaking efforts in esports drive engagement as well by celebrating our players and recognizing their achievements in new ways. As Bobby mentioned, we continue to make great progress on the Overwatch League. The 12 inaugural teams have now been unveiled their names and logos and fans will soon be able to celebrate their favorite team and players through both physical and digital merchandise. The Overwatch team is hard at work on refining the spectator viewing experience to make the game even more fun to watch, including team jerseys for in-game heroes, and new camera angles to get a better view of gameplay.","Pre-season competition begins next month at the Blizzard Arena Los Angeles. I was recently at the facility and can say that the arena and overall spectator experience are awesome. Over the past week, Blizzard hosted opening week competitions across a number of franchises for BlizzCon at the arena. We look forward to seeing some of you at the championship matches later this week in Anaheim. We have a number of other exciting new esports events in the pipeline, including the Call of Duty World League's upcoming season, which features the largest prize pool in franchise history.","Turning now to our third and final pillar, player investment. In-game services, features and content continue to be a recurring driver for our business resulting in a Q3 record of over $1 billion for in-game purchases and record year-to-date performance. King was the biggest contributor.","Bookings per paying user rose for the ninth quarter in a row to new record and the total number of paying players also rose for the first time since Q1 of 2016. King had two of the top 10 grossing games in the U. S., a level performance they have held for four consecutive years and as mentioned, Candy Crush returned to the number one position on the iOS and Android app stores in the U. S. for the quarter, highlighting the durability of the franchise that is now celebrating its fifth anniversary.","Candy Crush franchise's gross bookings were up 17% quarter-over-quarter and up 22% year-over-year, bringing the franchise back to its strongest bookings since Q4 of 2013. King is making progress on their pipeline and new games as well. The social casino game in partnership with Playstudios is currently in live testing and is now expected to launch globally in early part of next year and a strong pipeline of full game releases are in development for next year and beyond.","In advertising, King made progress this quarter in testing and product refinement. Player test continue to show that advertising can improve the player experience and provide advertisers with the premium performance.","King is actively building out advertising capabilities around sales, serving and targeting. And during 2018, King expects to ramp inventory with a deliberate and methodical rollout of ad product types, user cohorts and other. (13:42)","Both Activision and Blizzard also had strong quarter for player investment not only in their live games, but also in reimagined and re-mastered experiences from the libraries, including Blizzard's StarCraft: Remastered and Activision's Crash Bandicoot and Modern Warfare re-mastered.","Just as importantly, Activision continued to introduce content and feature updates for Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which resulted in relatively stable quarter-over-quarter in-game purchases for that franchise. This approach of continuing to provide content and features for the community wherever they are playing, even years after the initial launch, opens up growth opportunities for years to come.","In summary, our record performance in the quarter and our record performance year-to-date are the result of our team's passionate dedication to serve the growing communities across our franchises. That dedication is now extending into new growth levers like esports, consumer products and advertising, and we're excited about our growth prospects ahead.","Spence will now review the Q3 numbers and Q4 outlook in more detail. Spence?","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Coddy. Today, I'll our review our better-than-expected Q3 results as well as our outlook for Q4 and our raised outlook for the full year. I'll start with our Q3 segment results. We delivered record Q3 segment revenue and operating income, up 16% and 10%, respectively, and record year-to-date performance.","Importantly, we saw strength across all of our segments with each of Activision Blizzard and King contributing to our over performance for the quarter compared to guidance. By focusing on our strategic pillars of reach, engagement and player investment across our breadth of leading franchises, we were able to outperform our outlook, deliver strong results in the quarter and prudently invest in long-term growth initiatives.","King had a great quarter. The business delivered segment revenues of $528 million, up 15% year-over-year; operating income of $208 million, up 51% year-over-year; and operating margin of 39%, which was up 9 percentage points year-over-year, and all of which also meaningfully over performed prior quarter.","As Coddy mentioned, King's revenues have now grown for the third sequential quarter to the highest they've been since the first quarter of 2015 and mobile gross bookings grew to an all-time record. This is the result of really strong execution by the King team and their commitment to continuous community engagement, data-driven platform insights and capabilities and consistent delivery of new, impactful game features. Following the King acquisition early last year, the team further prioritized resources on Candy Crush and live franchised tiles. We're seeing the benefits of this discipline and focus.","Activision had a record third quarter, including segment revenues of $759 million; operating income of $261 million; and operating margin of 34%, driven by the successful launch of Destiny 2, the ongoing engagement of Call of Duty community and continued contribution from our library with Crash Bandicoot.","Activision doubled revenues and more than doubled operating income year-over-year, leading to record Q3 and record year-to-date financial performance. Blizzard's $531 million in segment revenues and $168 million of operating income were driven by the strength of the World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises. Performance was down year-over-year as expected, given the difficult comp to last year's Q3, which featured both a World of Warcraft expansion and the first full quarter following Overwatch's release.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures, which include the impact of deferrals. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. So for the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.62 billion, which was $233 million above our August guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of $284 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 in Q3, which were $0.16 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include net deferrals of $0.13.","For the year-to-date on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.97 billion, up 8% year-over-year and EPS of $1.12, up 19% year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated operating margin of 37% and record EPS of $1.73.","Looking at cash flow and capital structure; we delivered Q3 operating cash flow of $379 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments, about one-third of which is held domestically. And we ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of roughly $800 million.","So now let's turn to our Q4 outlook. In Q4, we'll continue our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community, including updates for Blizzard's Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises and execution against a robust slate of features and live ops across King's titles. As you know, Activision released Destiny 2 on PC on October 24 and we have plans to release our first expansion and add-on content for that franchise on December 5. And of course, Activision releases the much anticipated Call of Duty: World War II tomorrow. So lots happening this quarter.","For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.7 billion, with a GAAP deferral of $635 million. Product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a GAAP tax rate of 36% and GAAP to non-GAAP share count of 769 million shares with GAAP EPS of $0.10. For Q4, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 52%, a tax rate of 27% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 with a GAAP deferral of $0.46.","Now turning to our raised 2017 full-year outlook, which passes through Q3 business over performance and also raises Q4 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.675 billion with a GAAP deferral of $175 million. Product cost of 23%, operating expenses of 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million and GAAP tax rate at 14%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares with \u2013 for both GAAP and non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.22.","For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 23%, operating expenses of 43% and non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million with a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.08, and we have a GAAP deferral of $0.08.","So with the robust Q4 product and feature slate, we're working really hard to finish the year strong. We plan to build on that momentum in 2018 and beyond with a franchise-driven strategy across our core interactive games and emerging opportunity areas. As always, we'll pursue these initiatives with fiscal discipline, intense prioritization and a focus on shareholder value.","Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, Riccardo and Dennis as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys and congrats on another strong quarter. I have two questions. The first one is how are you thinking about driving further improvements in bookings at King based on what we've seen for the quarter and year-to-date thus far? Thank you.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Colin. It's Riccardo here. Maybe before I answer your question just want to highlight that 2017 has been a great year for gross booking growth. And this quarter has been the third quarter of sequential gross booking growth and Candy regains the number one slot in the U.S. app store, and we are now the leading developer in the U.S. and this has also been, as you heard before, the highest ever quarter in mobile gross bookings. So I think we're very proud of that. And I'm very proud of what the team has achieved.","Now, we have achieved these results by executing on our strategy. We used our proven system to deliver content and features that our players love, and we also focused more resources on live operations to increase the cadence of our updates. If you think of our network and of the size of our network and the experience over the years, we have a unique opportunity to better understand really what players like, what players want. And so we developed a portfolio of features and content and we test these features and content with our players. And when we get these right, we add to the player experience and this converts into higher player engagement and greater player investment.","We can see the results of this virtuous loop in our Q3 results. However, I would like to point out that this quarter, our system delivered an exceptional hit rate, and this has led to a greater amortization growth than usual. So over time, while we don't expect the same level of increase every quarter, we remain confident in our long-term ability to deliver innovation and growth with this rigorous process.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. And may be as a follow-up \u2013 sorry, the follow-up was just mentioning some of the reach initiatives for King that you first talked about on the last call, if you could expand on those as well? Thank you.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Sure. Sure. So reach is a key priority for us and we have two approaches to stabilize and then grow the reach. We are focusing on marketing and we're focusing on product. On the marketing side, the goal is to drive new installs and to regain less players. Here we're focused on innovating how we market our live titles. So as an example of innovation is the partnership with CBS and Lionsgate in the U.S. for the Candy Crush TV show.","On the product side, here we focus on the live games, and we're working on new content and new features to drive greater player retention. So the teams are now prioritizing this initiative alongside our monetization and engagement initiatives and that as you heard earlier, have been so successful in driving gross bookings.","On top of these initiatives, we're also working on new game launches. New game launches have always been proven as driving reach and having a positive impact on reach. And our development teams are now working really hard on prototyping and developing new titles for the coming years. I would like to point out that reach is everyone's problem. We're all focused on reach and changing the reach trajectory, however, will take time. We have the team, and we have the focus to do it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats on a strong quarter. You've talked about esports as an investment in the near-term without material profits. Can you help quantify near-term milestones and other benefits that having the leagues can offer such as the marketing for Overwatch and other titles? And what are the plans for additional leagues beyond the Overwatch League? Thank you.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. It's Bobby, I'll answer that. In fact, today, we're having our first owners meeting for the Overwatch League, and we view that as a major growth initiative and a very sizable standalone opportunity for the company. We're building the league for the long-term and, in our view, the opportunity, rivals, what you see in professional sports for a lot of perspectives but starting with the demographics to the audience.","The first season is really about building a solid foundation, delivering world-class viewing experience, distributing the content as broadly as we can to our audiences around the world, making sure that we have that strong and growing global fan base and really building the league revenues in the key three areas that we've outlined in the past. And today was a great announcement in that regard in sponsorships, in the sale of broadcasting media rights and in licensing.","And we've got a really great group of owners who I just came from. We've got some of the great entrepreneurs in sports, some of the great entrepreneurs of the endemic esports businesses. And they are all focused on driving local marketing campaigns to build out their fan bases in the markets that they serve. I think we're off to a very good start in the sponsorship front with the announcements that we've made today. And we'll continue to deliver new news and information as we get closer to our January 10 launch date. So it will clearly benefit the franchise from a marketing perspective, but it is a great business opportunity in and of itself.","As far as other leagues \u2013 right now, we are so focused on executing Overwatch League as best as we can that we're not really planning on announcing anything else right now. And look, I would say, that the greatest single benefit that we get from celebrating our professional players is that these are people who make an incredible investment and commitment into our games and we have the opportunity to really celebrate and recognize and reward them in an exceptional way. And we think that that has the most tremendous value to our players and to the company.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","This is Mike. I just want to add, we're incredibly excited about the launch of the league on January 10. We really view this as sort of building a foundation for this league that we don't expect will scale overnight. Sports leagues take time to build. But with the foundation that we're building, we're really excited about what the future will hold, and we think it will benefit players, teams, fans and have a really long-term potential for the Overwatch League.","In terms of how the league might benefit the franchise overall, we really view that as being tied \u2013 what is good for the league is good for the Overwatch game as well. So, incredibly excited about the inaugural season.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And appreciate the clarity on the Destiny digital data. Just wondering, how has the total engagement trended for Destiny 2 to-date, may be compared to Destiny 1 over that same timeframe on a like-for-like basis?","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, thanks, Evan. It's Eric. We're very happy with the performance of Destiny 2 thus far. With just a month of sales, it's already, as Coddy mentioned, the bestselling console game of the year-to-date in the United States. But beyond that we've also improved on pretty much all the other important metrics that we look at. We're now ahead of Destiny 1 in total consumer spend. Hours per player reached a new franchise record and average revenue per user was up as well. We also have a very strong attach rate to the Expansion Pass, which we think is a great indication of our fans' ongoing commitment to engagement with the franchise.","So we know our fans wanted a game with a great engaging story, with great characters and a more accessible experience overall. And we think we lived up to their high expectations on those measures. And we also know that our fans are already hungry for more. And as I've said on past calls, we now have not just Bungie but multiple AAA teams developing content for Destiny and we're planning on having more content than ever before to support Destiny 2, starting with the first expansion that's coming on December 5.","And also, we launched Destiny on PC, which we expect to open up new geographies where we think Destiny is going to be really well received. So we've got events coming, we've got compelling in-game content coming, we've got strong marketing and events planned through the holidays, so we've got good momentum there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So, look, very impressive with Destiny 2's digital mix accounting for over 50% of sell-through. So it does seem like full game downloads are picking up steam in the console business and I thought you might update us on where you see this trend heading in the next year? Thank you.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. This is Spence. I'll take this one. Let me first underscore that we've got great retail partners. Retail is going to continue to be important for us on console for some time to come, but, that said, this consumer trend that we're seeing and the shift to full game digital downloads, it's real, it's a strong tailwind for our business, and it's a good thing. That digital connection, it brings us closer to our consumer and it creates better economics. It's roughly $10 of direct profit improvement and then there's also indirect savings and margin benefit and even some working capital benefits.","But I guess, getting back to your question on the trends, I believe we mentioned last year that our historical digital mix was about 20% to 25% for Call of Duty and more in the 30% to 40% range for Destiny and Overwatch on console. And historically, we've been seeing that digital mix increase at about 5 points a year.","As you point out, with Destiny 2 digital at over 50% console sell-through so far, we believe we're seeing some acceleration in that digital shift. And while that's consumer-led move, I'd be remiss if I don't point out just for a moment that our team put together some really compelling digital premium packages and drove a lot of credit for creating packages that clearly resonated with Destiny's community and delivered a lot of value.","So as we look to the kind of finish out the year and into the back half of Q4, we'd expect retail actually to gain some share as we reach a broader audience. But we do still expect to end the year well ahead of the original Destiny digital mix. I guess, I should point out that when you look at a franchise like Call of Duty, there's different dynamics there. So it's not like-for-like. Call of Duty, as you know, is a more mass-market game and the more mass you get, the higher the retail share. So while we're seeing higher digital preorders as well on World War II relative to any prior Call of Duty title, that digital mix is still well below what we're seeing for Destiny 2.","So with CoD, we may still also see that acceleration from the 5 point historical rate, but again, it's a consumer-led shift predominantly, and we'll have to wait and just see how the quarter lands. Overall, though, this is a good news for our business, it's a nice trend. There's a lots of runway to go to expand that digital full game sales footprint and grow that connection with our players.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Spence, and congratulations on the quarter.","Spencer Adam Neumann - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust.","Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question guys. Maybe just following up on the prior comments on Call of Duty, I know there's a bunch of leading indicators that you guys track versus prior releases, including total preorders and preorder mix. Can you just walk us through where we stand on all those leading indicators that you think are relevant? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure, Matt. This is Eric. I'll take that one. The good news is all indications are very strong. We've got preorders that are strong, awareness and purchase intent which, of course, we also track at the top of the scale. And anticipation amongst our community is at a fever pitch that we're very excited about. The other thing that sets us up well is the fact that we had our Monthly Active Users on the Call of Duty franchise at a record high in Q3, and it's always great for our new content launches when we have people hyper engaged with the franchise.","So as Coddy mentioned, Call of Duty has been the number one console franchise worldwide, seven of the last eight years. We expect to extend that streak this year. And obviously, our community is excited that we're returning to the sort of grittier, boots-on-the-ground authentic military setting that the franchise's roots, but we didn't \u2013 it's also important to know that we didn't just do that. I think that's the headline, but we didn't rest on those laurels. We're also bringing a bunch of really cool innovations like an entirely new way to play multiplayer called War Mode which is more team-based and collaborative than any mode we've had before. That was a huge hit in the beta that we did as well as Sledgehammer's take on Call of Duty: Zombies, which is literally sort of jump out of your seat scary, so kind of a really new experience there.","I guess, all in all, we just feel like everything has really come together with this game whether you're a current fan playing one of our past Call of Duty games, or whether your fan who's maybe even taken a break from the franchise, we feel like this is the game that's going to bring our entire community back together and bring new people in as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew Edward Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Can you discuss in a little more detail recent performance and trends you're seeing across World of Warcraft and Hearthstone? And how you're thinking about the pace of investments for these franchises going forward? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. So we continue to be very happy with both of those \u2013 with the strength of both of those franchises.","And I'd tell you on the World of Warcraft side, we are investing more than ever. The team has been hard at work delivering on our commitment to the community to deliver more content, more consistently between expansions, that's been going really well. Since Legion was launched in August of last year, we had \u2013 we've added multiple content updates and the updates have been really well received by the community. We've seen engagement up versus last year, when you look at time spent per player and also frequency of play.","On the Hearthstone side, Hearthstone's continuing to do really well. Engagement has been really strong throughout the year driven by our successful content launches and our innovative event specifically, with the last expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne. As you heard, it's had a franchise record for expansion sales and also drove strong engagement with time spent, up double-digit percentage year-over-year and MAUs were also up year-over-year as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. My question Happy Call of Duty Eve! one of the question on King. Could you just talk to sort of the biggest learnings on the King advertising side, kind of what drives the business from here? And what are some of the big milestones you're looking for on the advertising business into 2018?","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hey, Brian. This is Riccardo. So the advertising business, the first priority in the advertising business has been to build a strong ad team, and we now have industry-proven leadership onboard and we are making great progress in filling other key roles in the team as we grow the advertising organization.","Our vision for the business is to deliver great experiences for the players that also drive results for the marketeers. And we have made progress on several dimensions. We have, first of all, been developing several ad formats with a particular focus on those that are supportive of the gameplay. So an example of such an ad format is rewarded video ads where players receive an in-game benefit for initiating and for viewing an ad. And in this respect, I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing. We're steadily enabling more of our player cohorts to see ads as a consequence of that.","We're also growing traction with advertisers from a range of industries. For example, entertainment, tech, banking, and we're seeing traction in key markets, in the U.S. and in the U.K. As a result of this, the team has started increasing the volume of impressions.","On the sales side, we're seeing traction in the direct sales, and we're also continuing to make resource and partnership investments to build on this momentum we are seeing in programmatic buying.","Looking forward, we will continue to develop the business with a focus on aligning the experience of our players with the delivery of key metrics for the advertisers. You heard Coddy earlier and, basically, we expect to ramp up the advertising business during 2018. So if I have to summarize, in short, I'm very excited about the opportunity that advertising provides for King, for our players, and for advertisers.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, everyone.

But for those who have not gone to BlizzCon, is there a way for you to tease any of the upcoming announcements? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Well, first, we're going to have to get you to BlizzCon one of these days, but it's just an amazing community event.

Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and good afternoon. We're pleased to announce that Activision Blizzard delivered another quarter of better-than-expected financial results, driven by the remarkable talent of our employees, strong partnerships and our continued ability to develop and build large franchises with highly engaged communities. This ability developed over the 21 years we've been leading this business is illustrated by our portfolio of leading franchises and the industry's best development teams.","Building billion-dollar franchises takes many years and requires significant financial, creative, technical, distribution, marketing and customer service resources, as well as management continuity and discipline. Our strong cash flow, significant capital resources and long-term view of our business provide us the unique ability to thoughtfully invest in major new growth and margin expansion opportunities like Skylanders.","We continue to build a portfolio of mega franchises. In 2012, we expect to have at least 4 franchises that generate significant operating margins and contribute meaningfully to our company's profitability. In looking beyond 2012, we have the strongest pipeline of new potential mega franchises in our history, including Bungie's New Universe and Blizzard's new MMORPG, as well as an expansion of Call of Duty to China.","We continue to focus our resources on our largest and most promising opportunities, a formula that has produced strong results over the long term and which we expect will continue to do so in the future.","Our pipeline includes some of the most ambitious titles we've ever developed, including such highly anticipated games as Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo III, World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria and StarCraft II: The Heart of the Swarm, as well as Activision Publishing Skylanders Giants and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, each of which we hope will set new benchmarks for quality, immersion, innovation and great game play.","All 5 franchises have built large, loyal communities with demanding expectations. And we believe that by attracting and retaining the industry's best talent, anticipating trends and understanding our audiences' needs locally, as well as globally, we'll be able to create new entertainment experiences that continue to set the quality standards in all of entertainment as we have for more than 2 decades.","We're leading the year with Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo III, which features an innovative auction house that allows players to trade objects using real-world currency. Consumer feedback from the beta test has been remarkable, and pre-orders have already set a new record for Blizzard.","Blizzard has also been hosting a large-scale beta test for World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria, which will add a tremendous amount of new content and innovation to the unmatched World of Warcraft experience. We expect that the new features, storylines and game play mechanics will be embraced by the WoW community worldwide. Later in the call, Mike will outline the progress made on both titles and the others in development like StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm.","Activision Publishing is celebrating the extraordinary success of Skylanders Spyro's Adventure. Based on our current internal estimates, we believe that Skylanders toy sales in Q1 exceeded those of Star Wars' toys, which had been the #1 action figure line.","And to further build on the Skylanders' momentum, this fall we'll launch Skylanders Giants, which expands the breakthrough play experience that brings toys to life. Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure has been our biggest ever new IP launch and is on track to deliver an outstanding return on one of our biggest investments. Later in the call, Eric will share with you some of our plans for Giants, which brings a new level of innovation to the game, the toys and our marketing and retail strategies.","Similarly, we believe that the recently announced Call of Duty: Black Ops II will redefine the Call of Duty franchise through new levels of innovation in game play. We believe that it has the potential to be the best Call of Duty ever. Along with our retailers, we hope to make Call of Duty the biggest entertainment experience of the year.","We continue to heavily invest in our large franchises in order to further widen the moats that surround these successful properties. The value of these investments is demonstrated by our unique ability to create immersive online experiences that aggregate large and vibrant player communities around our brands and keep them connected in a 24\/7  world. Today, we have substantial resources dedicated to online product developments and services that allow our players to communicate and collaborate with each other, while also giving us a way to interact with and supports our players.","We have approximately 50 million monthly active users across all of our franchises. And through high-margin online offerings like subscription and membership-paid services, digital downloads and value-added services, we are already able to deliver more value and choice to consumers than ever before.","Blizzard's upgraded Battle.net platform connects over 10 million players across the entire Blizzard portfolio, and this is expected to increase with the upcoming launch of Diablo III. Activision's Call of Duty Elite is already one of the fastest-growing entertainment services ever and continues to grow with over 2 million premium annual paid members and a total of over 10 million registered users. We expect that in the future, by continuing to offer innovative connected entertainment experiences, we'll further grow our player communities and our services and not just through Battle.net and Call of Duty Elite, but also through Call of Duty: Black Ops II multiplayer game play, our upcoming Call of Duty micro-transaction game for China, the new Skylanders web world, Blizzard's Mists of Pandaria and the upcoming StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm and our 2 largest online opportunities for the future, Bungie's genre-defining new intellectual property and Blizzard's new MMORPG.","In addition to building our player communities and service platforms for the benefit of our shareholders, I'm pleased to say that we've again strengthened our leadership team with the employment of Dennis Durkin as our new CFO. Thomas has been serving as both our CFO and COO since 2010 and he'll now be putting all of his efforts into the COO role, for which we are very grateful.","Our 2012 and future product and service pipelines have never been stronger. Looking ahead, while there are many risks to our business especially as we continue to compete with other forms of entertainment for players' leisure time and dollars, our leadership in digital, our strong franchise portfolio and platform capabilities, our long-term business strategies and our solid financial foundation should enable us to deliver another year of record earnings and extend our track record of long-term growth and shareholder value creation.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Durkin, who will review our financial performance. Dennis?","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to be joining you for my first earnings call. I know many of you from my previous roles at Microsoft, and I look forward to building relationships with those of you who I have not yet met. Before I'd get into the financials, I'd like to take a moment to say how pleased I am to be part of the Activision Blizzard team, a team which has an incredible track record of creating franchises and platforms with enduring value for shareholders. I have long admired their relentless focus and drive for innovation, their commitment to excellence and their ability to build immersive consumer experiences in connected communities. These are the ingredients I believe are key to the long-term success in value creation in our industry, and were key to the turnaround that we had while I was part of the great leadership team at Xbox.","Thank you, Bobby, Brian, the board and the entire leadership team for the warm welcome you have given me in my short time here. It is greatly appreciated. I am personally thrilled to be part of the team here at Activision Blizzard. ","So now on to the March quarter results followed by a review of our outlook for 2012. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated better-than-expected results with revenues of $1.17 billion and operating margin of 44% and EPS of $0.33. As expected, our results were down versus the prior year due to tough comps and lower subscribers for Blizzard's World of Warcraft; lower sales of Call of Duty, including fewer and later \u00e0 la carte DLC releases and the impact of revenue recognition for Elite, as well as increased sales and marketing spend for our new IP end services. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we generated better-than-expected results with revenues of $587 million and operating margin in excess of 15% and EPS of $0.06.","Our performance for the quarter was driven by our products with breakthrough innovation, online integration and digital revenue streams, including Blizzard's World of Warcraft, Activision's Call of Duty and our newest IP, Skylanders.","Turning to the specific P&L line items, please note all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For the quarter, GAAP product costs were 27%, operating expenses were 29%, and our tax rate was 25%. Non-GAAP product costs were 34%, in line with our outlook, and non-GAAP operating expenses were 51%, lower than our prior outlook primarily due to revenue outperformance. Finally, our tax rate came in as expected at 27%.","Now turning to the balance sheet. On March 31, we had no debt and $3.5 billion in cash or nearly $3 per share in cash and investments. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $153 million, and we repurchased 22 million shares for $261 million.","The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our cash flows are major competitive advantages for us. They afford us the ability to invest for future growth in internal opportunities with the highest return on invested capital like Skylanders, Call of Duty China or Blizzard's new MMO. They also allow us the ability to invest for future growth through attractive external opportunities such as our 10-year exclusive arrangement with Bungie and finally, they allow us to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","We began 2012 which financial strength, strong market fundamentals for digital and an expanding portfolio of category-leading franchises and unique online service capabilities that offer expansion opportunities for the long term. We remain focused on strengthening our operations at retail, expanding our digital footprint and adding innovation and new business models to each of our properties to continue to drive growth.","As previously discussed, we have 3 key priorities for 2012. First, we expect growth from Blizzard, driven by the expected launch of at least 2 titles this year including Diablo III, which we'll launch next week with this real money auction house. Second, Activision Publishing is focused on this year's new Call of Duty title, Black Ops II on Call of Duty Elite and on continuing to expand the scale of the Skylanders franchise.","Then finally, we plan to continue expanding operating margins. In 2012, margins should benefit from an increasing mix of higher margin revenues, including above-average margin for Skylanders toys and a high-margin Blizzard product slate. In addition, we remain focused on productivity improvements across multiple areas of operating expenses.","Now let's move on to our outlook. For calendar year 2012, on a GAAP basis, we are raising our outlook modestly and now expect net revenues of $4.2 billion, up $50 million from our prior outlook. We expect product costs of 28%, and operating expenses of 48%. We expect a tax rate of 26%, a diluted share count of about 1.15 billion and GAAP EPS of $0.65. As a reminder, our GAAP results are expected to be down versus the prior year due to significantly larger deferrals from 2012 into 2013, driven by Blizzard's slate and Call of Duty Elite.","For 2012, we now expect non-GAAP net revenues of $4.53 billion, a $30 million increase from our prior outlook and up versus the prior year. This year, we continue to expect non-GAAP revenues growth from Blizzard and from the core Activision Publishing business, primarily offset by a reduction in revenues from our distribution and affiliate businesses and negative FX assumptions year-over-year.","We now expect 2012 non-GAAP product cost of 27% and operating expenses of about 40%. We expect a tax rate of 27% and a diluted share count of about 1.15 billion, both of which can be used in all quarters. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.95, a new record. ","Now moving on to the June quarter. On a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $950 million, product costs of 29% and operating expenses of 50%. The tax rate and share count are the same as the full year.  Finally, we expect GAAP earnings per share of $0.13. ","For the June quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect record revenues of $805 million driven by our large line-up, including Activision Publishing's PROTOTYPE 2 and the -- as well as the Amazing Spider-Man and most importantly, Blizzard's highly-anticipated Diablo III.","We expect non-GAAP product costs for the quarter of 27% and operating expenses of 54%. Operating expenses are expected to be higher than the prior year due primarily to increased investment in sales and marketing for our large Q2 line-up and continued support of Skylanders. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.10. ","So in summary, Activision Blizzard delivered strong financial performance in Q1, and we expect record non-GAAP revenues in Q2. And although we have the vast majority of our product launches in front of us, we believe that the quality we are seeing in our titles and our strength in retail and digital, combined with our ability to create new revenue streams in our ongoing cost-containment efforts position us in 2012 for another year of margin expansion and record EPS.","So now let me hand it over to Eric to discuss our Activision Publishing business.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis, and hello, everyone. Today, I'm going to start with a few brief industry comments, and then I'll get into our slate. In its totality, the global market fundamentals for interactive entertainment remains strong driven by the largest installed base ever, which is still growing, and the continued growth in digital, especially in Asia and the fact that consumers are spending more time playing games than ever before.","These positive dynamics further expand what are already significant global opportunities for games with large passionate audiences. Our objective is to continue building our strong and growing global player communities, and we remain focused on 5 key areas that are well aligned against the market fundamentals that we believe will drive growth over the next few years. They include: one, expanding Call of Duty through continued momentum with the franchise, as well as a both geographic and platform expansion; two, enhancing the growing -- and growing the Call of Duty Elite online service platform; three, building on the momentum of Skylanders; four, laying the foundation for the new Bungie universe; and five, investing in high potential new IP, technology, platforms and business model.","We're pursuing each initiative aggressively, while also investing in our current slate of games. First, with respect to Call of Duty, as of March 31, the Call of Duty franchise had approximately 40 million monthly active users. In 2011, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was the #1 best-selling title in the U.S. and Europe and today remains, by far, the most played console game.","In addition, gamers are playing Modern Warfare 3 more often, and to date have logged more than 2 billion total online game sessions, which is a 19% increase over Black Ops for the comparable period. With respect to our new online service, Call of Duty Elite now has over 10 million registered members, including more than 2 million premium members at the end of April, representing a very strong start.","Engagement with Elite is increasing since January. We have seen a 33% increase in premium memberships. Additionally, our multiple screen 24\/7 strategy is working. We've launched a lead on the PC, TV and mobile devices. We're also expanding features such as HD streaming Elite TV to our console apps and plan to continue extending this accessibility via the rapidly growing smart devices such as tablets.","Finally, clans are a huge hit. The consumer-related clan features have taken off with our players, with over 850,000 user-created clans or teams created within Elite today. These clans are extremely active, sticky and social, with millions of members participating in our proprietary Elite playing competitions.","Although we're pleased with our progress to date, we still have a lot to do. Building a service of this kind in addition to launching our content \u00e0 la carte takes time, effort and input from our players. Going forward, we'll continue to refine our service and give our players the best overall value and experience.","On November 13, we expect to further expand the franchise and the Elite service with the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops II, the sequel to the best-selling console game of all time, Call of Duty: Black Ops. Today, player engagement for the original Call of Duty: Black Ops remains incredibly high more than 17 months after the launch. Black Ops II is hands-down our most ambitious Call of Duty game to date and pushes the franchises' boundaries more than ever before. Treyarch is challenging assumptions on every front with meaningful innovations in single player campaign, multiplayer, zombies, facial animation and graphics technology.","They've created an authentic fiction rooted in credible, near-future conflicts. The game features advanced weaponry, robotics and grown warfare, many of which are either already in the arsenals of today's super powers or are being prototyped as we speak, as well as advanced graphics technology that will drive the stunning cinematic action to new heights. In addition, in running in a multiplayer engine for the first time, Zombies gives players a bigger and more diverse set of game play experiences, as well as entirely new ways to wage war with the undead. In a multiplayer, they're embracing all levels and play styles to give players more ways to engage in what will be hands down the most visually-enhanced multiplayer experience ever on a console.","We are all in on this game, and we believe Black Ops II could redefine the franchise and be the best Call of Duty game we've ever made. To date, Black Ops II has exceeded every internal milestone and the initial external media feedback has also been incredible. After just our first reveal, the official PlayStation magazine said, Black Ops II was \"the most innovative Call of Duty in years.\" Destructoid said Black Ops II was \"impossibly beautiful\" and for G4tv, Black Ops II is \"the most ambitious Call of Duty game ever.\"","We've also been extremely pleased with early consumer response and engagement. The Black Ops II revealed trailer was the most watched video of the day on YouTube and views were up 82% compared to the reveal trailer for Modern Warfare 3. During our launch, we had 5 of the top 9 U.S. top-trending topics on Twitter at the same time. And Facebook traffic is 43% higher than the prior year.","And finally, although it's very early, we're also incredibly pleased with the pre-orders, which in the first week since reveal are tracking ahead of the record-breaking pace set by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Overall, we think this game and the move to the near future setting is the biggest step for franchise since leaving World War 2 and bringing Call of Duty into the modern era. We look forward to sharing more details with you in the upcoming months.","In addition to focusing tremendous time and effort on expanding the Call of Duty franchise this year, we're also focused on driving the momentum of Skylanders, which is expected to easily cross the $500 million mark in life-to-date sales in 2012. This year, Skylanders offers us multiple expansion opportunities. First is simply catching up with toy demand for our best-selling family franchise Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure. Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was the #3 best-selling video game in Q1 and for our internal estimates, we believe it was also the best-selling action figure line, outpacing even Star Wars.","To put our performance in perspective, Skylanders had over $100 million of sales in the first quarter alone, which exceeded what Rovio, the developer of Angry Birds, reported in total company revenues for all of 2011.","The stronger starts we've have, the global toy industry is an $80 billion opportunity and Skylanders still has plenty of room to grow. Even after shipping over 20 million toys in 2011, demand was so high following the holidays, we were out-of-stock for much of the first quarter. We substantially increased capacity and believe that we'll now be in a better position to meet demand going forward.","We also continue to build the brand beyond the game. Today, we have more than 1 million registered web world users, and we expect to increase that number by offering more content and feature, some of which will be monetized. In early April, we launched our first mobile Skylanders game, Skylanders Cloud Patrol, which quickly became a top-selling iOS game and has received strong 5-star quality reviews. Cloud Patrol continues our progression into mobile gaming where we can pursue new business models and opportunities for our existing franchises, as well as our large portfolio of catalog profits.","We also have a comprehensive licensing program underway for the franchise and we announced partnerships with Frito-Lay, as well as opportunities in apparel, back-to-school, plush toys and more.","And later this fall, we'll be bringing Skylanders Giants to market. Giants will build on Skylanders breakthrough innovation with 8 supersized Giants figures and 8 all new Light Core characters. Jerry Storch, the CEO of Toys \"R\" Us, who joined us for the launch of Skylanders Giants at New York Toy Fair said \"He expects Skylanders become one of the most successful toy franchises in history.\"","And we believe we have a highly innovative product pipeline, as well as the supply chain, retail and marketing capabilities to live up to this promise. Looking beyond this year, we continue to develop, plan and prepare for 2 of our largest growth opportunities: Bungie genre-defining new IP and our new free-to-play micro-transaction Call of Duty game for the large and rapidly growing Chinese market. Development on both these large-scale projects is progressing very well, and we look forward to sharing additional details on their game play mechanics and business models in the future.","In summary, our slate this year, our future pipeline and our expanding service platforms are well aligned with the market opportunities and the passions of our players. I'm looking forward to updating you on our plans and performance as the year unfolds and we'll also have more details on our upcoming releases to share with you at E3 in early June. ","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Morhaime who'll provide you with an update on Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime","Thank you, Eric. 2012 is already shaping up to be a busy an exciting year at Blizzard, as we're poised to deliver fresh content to our players in all 4, all of our major franchises. I'll begin discussing our franchise updates with World of Warcraft.","At the end of Q1, global subscribership for World of Warcraft remained at 10.2 million. Maintaining our subscriber levels puts us in a great position as we drive toward the launch of Mists of Pandaria later this year. We opened the beta in late March and have rapidly expanded testing through a good portion of our community, including the 1.2 million players who signed up for the World of Warcraft Annual Pass.","That program closed at the end of April and was very successful. Thus far, the feedback we've collected from the Mists of Pandaria beta tests have been great and development continues to move with a good pace as we open up more of the expansion content to players.","Mists of Pandaria will offer a brand-new continent to explore, a new player class, the monk, and more importantly, new game modes that will help World of Warcraft continue to engage its diverse audience. Scenarios will offer for a more relaxed way of playing at a group that's less structured than traditional dungeons. Challenge modes will give hard-core players and guilds new ways to compete with each other while earning cool rewards. And the pet battle system will offer players a light-hearted diversion from regular questing, vengeance, PvP.","On the Diablo front, we are less than a week away from launching. In preparation, we recently conducted an open beta stress test for Diablo III where anyone could download and try out the game. Response we got was huge with more than 2 million people worldwide participating in the open beta.","All the testing we've done over the past several months has been critical for us in polishing and preparing Diablo III for launch, particularly in the case with the auction house feature. We believe that having this convenient method for item trading integrated within the game will enhance the overall player experience. Now all that's left is to get the game into the hands of our players. Official midnight launch events for Diablo III have been announced for locations around the world, including the United States, Europe, Korea, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.","More than 8,000 retail locations across North America and Europe will also be open at midnight to celebrate the launch. Our players are clearly excited about Diablo III as it's already set a Blizzard record for pre-orders, including those who signed up for the Annual Pass.","We look forward to providing a more definite sales update in the coming weeks. Most importantly, I'm proud of all the hard work that the team has put into Diablo III. This game has been a long time in the making, and our community has been supportive of us every step of the way. I'm confident that their patience will be rewarded next week when we launch our best Diablo game yet.","Meanwhile, the StarCraft 2 development team continues to forge ahead. The team has begun early testing on the arcade update that will make big improvements to the custom game experience on Battle.net. In fact, the team is already working with map creators in the StarCraft 2 community to update their maps and take full advantage of the new functionality. We're aiming to make the new arcade system live in the next coming months.","In addition to the work being done on arcade, development on Heart of the Swarm is going very well. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that we would offer a beta sneak peak of Heart of the Swarm to attend the use of Major League Gaming Spring Championship. The event will take place at Anaheim Convention Center from June 8 to June 10. It won't be too long after the MLG tournament that we'll be ready to announce plans for our beta.","We'll also be running our own U.S.A. national finals for our own StarCraft dual championship series event at the same event. This is just one of the many such events that we're running with partners in countries around the world. Our goal is to identify and foster local heroes in various countries and have them compete in the StarCraft II global finals.","New developments from Korea also bode well for StarCraft II eSports. Just last week, we announced partnerships with the Korean eSports Association and ON GameNet, the cable-television station, to create new StarCraft 2 leagues in Korea. These new leagues will complement GOMTV's successful global StarCraft II league, providing viewers with even more options for StarCraft II eSports. This news has created tremendous excitement in the StarCraft community as many of the popular pro-gamers from StarCraft I are preparing to compete in StarCraft II. ","As I mentioned earlier, 2012 is already a busy year at Blizzard. With Diablo III launching next week, Mists of Pandaria well into beta testing and Heart of the Swarm close to beta, we are well positioned to deliver multiple titles in the coming year, which means Battle.net is going to be an even more exciting place to be for online gamers.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Edward Williams with BMO Capital.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a quick question on Skylanders. Can you comment a little bit about what supply is like? Obviously, it was running thin through much of the quarter. If you can comment on how supply is at the moment and then as we look through the year as a whole, how much of the Skylanders' revenue should we see this year is coming from toys versus coming from games?","Eric Hirshberg","Well in terms of supply, despite some pretty optimistic and aggressive planning, we, as I said, we were out of supply for much of the quarter, but we've increased our capacity greatly, and we think we're catching up to supply now, which one great growth opportunity in and of itself. And we've also increased capacity for the holiday and for the launch of Giants.","Dennis Durkin","Yes. And just on the split between games and toys, at this point we're not providing revenue or sort of future guidance as it relates to the 2 of those. Although as Eric points out, we have seen some channel normalization over the last few months. The one point we would make, though, is attach rates are extremely strong on the toys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Neil Doshi, Citigroup.","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two really quick questions. One, it seems like some publishers are now starting to spend money on Gen 4 R&D. Just wanted to know if that is something that you guys are planning to do? And then secondly, it looks like Blizzard Op margins grew sequentially, which is nice. Just wanted to know when you might think that we'll return to kind of that 40% or even 50% operating margin range for Blizzard?","Robert A. Kotick","Well with respect to our next-generation development, we're not going to comment on that. And who wants to...","Dennis Durkin","On Blizzard operating margins, was that the second part of your question? Neil?","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Yes, it was.","Michael Morhaime","Okay. So we talked about the -- on the last earnings call, we're very optimistic about the prospects of the Blizzard's profitability. They have the strongest slate ahead of them that they had in a long time. And as you know, we are in a scale business. Blizzard in particular is a PC online business, which is above average margins because obviously, getting a lot of parties participating in the PC platform as a revenue stream. So we would expect to see continued improvement in Blizzard margins as the slate rolls out over the next couple of quarters.","Operator","And we'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Dennis, first congratulations on your position. Mike I want to follow-up on World of Warcraft. If you look at engagement levels and use of levels in World of Warcraft to date, would it be fair to say that the game has stabilized at this point and can you comment if subscriber levels changed at all since the end of the quarter?","Michael Morhaime","So we don\u2019t provide intraquarter updates on subscribership. What I can say is that we made a large content update towards the end of Q4, each did help us out a lot on player engagement. And we expect to see increased engagement with the launch of Mists of Pandaria.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","With regard to Modern Warfare and then -- Modern Warfare 3 comparing it to Black Ops, you said sales of packaged goods are down. And I know it's not quite apples-to-apples in terms of comparing your digital this year versus last year. But just for your full year, do you think with the digital options that you have, should the total Modern Warfare 3 revenue be up versus Black Ops?","Dennis Durkin","Yes, so you're right. Just to kind of ease your question apart a little bit, based on the life-to-date numbers, we feel very good about where Modern Warfare 3 is relative to Black Ops. It was more front-end loaded, which obviously is very good for us as a business in terms of getting more of the frontline pricing. So but light-to-date on the HD platforms, they're roughly equivalent, if not slightly up for Modern Warfare 3. The digital business year-over-year is not comparable. As you point out, relative to what's mentioned in the previous conference call about not only the timing of the map packs, but obviously with Elite launching of the great success that I think we have with 2 million subscribers of Elite. On a full year basis, I think we feel good about that business, where that will end up relative to where we were the past year. So we feel again, with the launch last week of the new trailer, we're very excited about the future for Black Ops II.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Brian Karimzad with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess first question is with the continuing growth of Call of Duty online playtime, and my assumption is that's translated over to the 360 platform and Xbox LIVE subscriptions. Any thoughts on how you might better capture the economics that Microsoft is receiving there? And then the other would be on your capital allocation, any consideration on the way you think about dividends versus buybacks now as you do establish some more of these steady cash flow streams?","Michael Morhaime","Yes, Brian I think the performance on Call of Duty online continues to be stellar. I think we built this business working together with our partners, both on the Xbox platform, as well as the PlayStation platform. We don't see that changing. We both bring unique capabilities to build in this business, and I think that's played out for everybody involved in a very economically attractive way. And we don't see that changing going forward.","Dennis Durkin","Relating to the second point that you, I guess, the second question was around capital allocations. I think you know the board buyback that was approved in, I guess, the April time frame or sort of just before that, so the board has authorized that and obviously the dividend went -- we went ex-dividend in March and that will be payable here in the coming months, yes, actually next week. So those are board level decisions but I think directionally from those, you can see a strong proclivity to get cash back to shareholders through either of those avenues.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, if I may just pop one more in on Skylanders, just given the strength of the attach rates, any consideration to adjusting the opening price point for it in the fall to induce up some of the addressable market?","Michael Morhaime","We haven't made any decisions yet on what the pricing is going to be for the fall. In the meantime, I think we have a great opportunity even running up to the holidays promoting existing Skylanders products, which continue to sell well. We had a great Easter holiday with tremendous amount of retail support. We are expanding the shelf space even ahead of the holiday because it's one of the best-selling products in toys and for kids in video games full stop. So we're not waiting for the holidays to continue to drive the installed base and we'll make our holiday decisions, including pricing and the support we're going to put behind it in due time.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Operator?","Operator","And we'll go next to the Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Obviously, people are excited about the Diablo III launch. I was wondering if you could comment about what plans you may have to bring Diablo III to China? There's been a fair amount of silence about that, but I assume it's a market that you're targeting.","Michael Morhaime","So we are excited about the potential for China, but our focus really has been on executing a smooth launch for the Rest of the World following the launch and we'll turn our attention to China and work on putting some plans together there. But nothing to announce at this stage.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

I would now like to turn the call over to Amrita Ahuja, Senior VP of Relations.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. We have a lot of exciting news to share with you. First, our proposed acquisition of King. Then Activision Blizzard Third Quarter Earnings Results, followed by Q&A.","I'd like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include comments about our plans and expectations regarding Activision Blizzard's pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment as well as our comments about our outlook and other future plans and expectations that we'll provide during the earnings report portion of this call.","A number of important factors could cause actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors indicated on the slide that is showing and those discussed in the Risk Factors section of Activision Blizzard's and King Digital Entertainment's SEC filings.","In particular, all of our statements with respect to the expected impact of the acquisition are subject to the risk that the acquisition may not be completed, or may not be completed on the expected timeline. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to Activision Blizzard and King Digital Entertainment as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they may ultimately prove to be incorrect.","The companies undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 3, 2015, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.","I would like to note that Activision Blizzard prepares its financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP and King Digital Entertainment prepares its financial information in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis for Activision Blizzard and on a non-IFRS basis for King Digital Entertainment. We refer to these measures as non-GAAP measures. Please refer to our Rule 2.5 announcement which is available at Activisionblizzard.acquisitionoffer.com and Activision Blizzard's Earning Release which is posted on Activisionblizzard.com for the applicable reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and further explanation.","There are also two PowerPoint overviews, one with respect to the deal and one with respect to Activision Blizzard's Q3 results which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the websites following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary.","Please note because this an Irish public company deal, there are certain limits on what we can say, specifically our statements must be limited to matters disclosed in the Rule 2.5 announcement which was released last night, and we won't be able to go beyond what is presented in that document. Irish law also places certain limitations on what are deemed to be profit forecasts, so we are more limited in what we can say about future prospects.","Now speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, our CEO; Thomas Tippl, our COO; Dennis Durkin, our CFO; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO and Co-Founder of King Digital Entertainment. Later we will be joined by Eric Hirshberg and Mike Morhaime to review Activision Blizzard's quarterly overperformance. And now, I would like to introduce our CEO Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Amrita. Over the last 25 years, we've demonstrated a consistent ability to identify opportunities to serve and support our audiences and deliver superior value to our shareholders. We're disciplined, deliberate and methodical whether in the development of new franchises, entering new segments and geographies and, perhaps most importantly, identifying transactions with great opportunity for shareholder value creation.","With respect to the latter, we've had very positive results and track records over the last 25 years because we care deeply about how we allocate our capital and prioritize our opportunities. The way we considered King is consistent with our proven history of evaluating acquisition opportunities. King operates in a rapidly-growing segment. They have a truly world-class management team, exceptional game development talent and great commercial instincts. The transaction is accretive, brings new audiences, and the King Corporate DNA is oriented towards great game making with commercial potential.","When we merged with Blizzard Entertainment, we found the right partner with extraordinary leadership. And when others dismissed the sustainability of Blizzard's incredible capacity for innovation, we were certain patience would be rewarded. And it has. We see a lot of the same characteristics today in King. We think now is the right time to enter mobile gaming in a meaningful way. Widespread mobile access around the world has opened up significant demand for engaging, fun content that players can enjoy anytime, anywhere.","By acquiring King, which has a proven ability to turn its games into iconic franchises, we will be a participant in the fastest-growing segment in gaming, a category that today is estimated to be $36 billion. It's still extremely fragmented and we believe has great promise for the future. We also believe King's management team, including Riccardo, Sebastian and Stephane, are some of the most talented executives in the game industry.","We've long admired their talents and after spending a lot of time over the last three years getting to know the King team, we realized how truly special their company is. They have over 1,600 incredibly talented people committed to a community of more than 450 million monthly active users. Acquiring King will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as the world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, genres and business models.","Combining Activision Blizzard's portfolio of some of the very best interactive entertainment franchises on the console and PC with King's leading mobile titles will create a world-class portfolio of games with strong endearing appeal to a wide range of demographics and audiences along with leadership positions across key platforms. The number one console franchise was Call of Duty, the number one PC franchise was World of Warcraft, and now two of the top five highest-grossing mobile games.","We'll have one of the largest entertainment networks in the world, with over 0.5 billion monthly active users, immediately opening up meaningful opportunities to grow and cross-promote content to provide enhanced offerings to our collective players while expanding into untapped geographies. The combined company will have diversified capabilities across business models, like subscription, up-front purchase, free-to-play and micro transaction.","Through our world-class properties and enhanced capabilities across segments and business models, we'll be able to diversify our revenue streams, enhancing our position as the most profitable interactive entertainment company in the world. The result is a transaction that will be accretive to estimated 2016 non-GAAP EPS estimates by approximately 30%. I couldn't be more excited to welcome King into the Activision Blizzard family.","And now Thomas will share with you the specifics of the transaction.","Thomas Tippl - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Bobby. Under the proposed transaction, Activision Blizzard will acquire all of the outstanding shares of King for $18 in cash per share for a total equity value of $5.9 billion or an enterprise value of $5 billion, representing a multiple of approximately 6.4 times King's estimated 2015 adjusted EBITDA. This transaction will be financed through a mix of offshore cash and fully committed debt financing. This will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet and conservative leverage.","Following today's announcement, our path to completion is subject to approval by the Irish High Court, the U.S., EU and other antitrust regulators as well as other customary closing conditions. In addition, the transaction is subject to a vote by King's shareholders. Apax and key management shareholders have committed to voting their shares in favor of the transaction. All in all, we expect the transaction to close by spring 2016.","Once the transaction closes, King will operate as an independent operating unit of Activision Blizzard, similar to how Blizzard Entertainment operates. We have an excellent track record of integrating with minimal disruption and in a way that maintains the organization's culture, creative independence and ability to really thrive. As Bobby said earlier, King's management team has been integral to their success. Riccardo, Sebastian and Stephane will continue to lead the business and they've all signed long-term contractual commitments.","We think this acquisition is an exciting opportunity for everyone connected to Activision Blizzard and to King. This is a very compelling transaction from a financial perspective. Together, we'll have more diversified and recurring revenues, a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. King's shareholders will also be getting a 20% plus premium to the recent share price and liquidity. And we'll be able to speed up our ability to capitalize on meaningful long-term growth opportunities. We'll reach more players across more audiences and expand our presence in fast-growing regions, such as Asia.","One of the most exciting things about this deal is what it means for our communities of players. By putting these two companies together, we'll have greater capabilities and expertise to enrich the player experience, an expanded network to reach players in virtually every country across the world and more resources to amaze and delight our players. We want to be wherever our players are, whether they are at home on consoles or PCs or out on their smartphones and tablets, and this deal enhances our ability to do just that.","I also want to talk to you about employee culture. It's something that's incredibly important at Activision Blizzard and something we really think sets us apart. We have a track record of attracting and retaining top talent. This is incredibly important in the entertainment and technology industries. And one of the reasons we are able to do this is because we have deep respect for the creative process. We are the destination for the best talent in the business. Activision Blizzard's commitment to innovation, talent development and the creative process is 100% mirrored in King's culture.","For Activision Blizzard debt holders, this transaction accelerates the promising path we are already on to build out our diverse portfolio, grow our predicable recurring revenue streams and generate strong cash flows while maintaining strong liquidity. This financial profile puts us on the path for near-term deleveraging and further supports our already investment grade financial profile. In fact, last night Moody's upgraded the company's debt ratings to investment grade upon announcement of the deal. King and Activision Blizzard are a great fit for all stakeholders and we're excited about what we'll be able to accomplish together.","As Bobby mentioned earlier, our long-term strategy has been focused on innovating on new high-growth platforms, expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property and building our capabilities to create compelling offerings to our diverse player base across genres, platforms, business models and geographies. You will hear more during the second half of this call about our strong results, which are further evidence that our strategy is working.","And this transaction meaningfully accelerates that growth strategy by providing Activision Blizzard with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest-growing segment of interactive entertainment, which is expected to grow by more than 50% from $36 billion in 2015 to $55 billion by 2019. Mobile franchises are now reaching results similar to established console franchises. King in particular has shown repeat success with multiple titles, and the leading franchises demonstrate a track record of continued success.","The combined company will have a world-class portfolio with some of the world's most iconic franchises in the entertainment industry across key platforms. Activision Blizzard knows how to create, develop and sustain a portfolio of titles and turn them into iconic franchises with long-lasting appeal and deep engagement. The names you see on this slide are some of the most successful interactive entertainment franchises in the world.","What attracted us to King is that, in similar ways to us, they have a proven ability to extend the success of their core titles, developing them into proven franchises. Together we'll be able to apply our highly complementary strengths, assets and operational expertise to drive deep year-round engagement and digital revenue streams and build upon our proven development models to bring new content to more audiences across genres.","Our combined audience will have more than half a billion monthly active users, making it one of the largest entertainment networks in the world. Our audience includes a broad diversity of demographics in almost every country around the globe. The ability to cross-promote our industry-leading franchises across this highly engaged network is incredibly exciting.","As part of our growth strategy, not only do we have some of the leading owned intellectual property in interactive entertainment, but we've been building capabilities across platforms, genres, business models and geographies.","It is clear that our acquisition of King provides important, highly complementary capabilities in key areas: in mobile, free-to-play and the ability to reach casual gamers in emerging geographies. Our capabilities in infrastructure have never been better, and we've never been in such a great position to deliver content to any audience on any platform. That is an exciting prospect for not only our fans, but for our employees and for our shareholders as well.","Now let me introduce Riccardo, who will walk you through King's business.","Riccardo Zacconi - CEO and Co-Founder, King Digital Entertainment","Thank you, Thomas. I would like to share a little about King, especially for those who are (15:14) company. King is a leader in mobile gaming and has been developing games since 2003. We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe, Asia and the U.S. that are driven by dedicated world-class talent. King has a portfolio of best-in-class franchises that include the top grossing games within their sub-genres. Our four franchises, Candy Crush, Farm Heroes, Pet Rescue and Bubble Witch, are category-leading brands. We operate them as a live service and continually give our players new, highly-engaging content by adding new levels, time-based live ops and extensions with innovative modes of play.","We also launched new games within our existing franchises. Candy Crush Soda Saga is our highly successful sister title to the original hit, Candy Crush Saga. We have seen that these efforts have transformed our games into true game franchises. In third quarter 2015, more than three years after the original launch of Candy Crush Saga, an average of 92 million people played Candy Crush games every day.","The popularity of our games and success of our monetization and franchise strategy have translated to a leading position in the mobile gaming business. We have had two of the top five grossing games on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for three consecutive quarters, and at least three of the top 15 grossing games for seven consecutive quarters.","We have built one of the largest networks of mobile game players, with 474 million monthly active users in Q3 who played 1.4 billion games per day. Our network is a key asset for launching new games through cross-promotion.","We are excited about what we bring to the combined company. We have a strong pipeline which includes new franchise games and other new games to diversify our portfolio into new genres, which we have just begun with our first non-casual game launch.","Since our company already has a strong presence globally, we see meaningful opportunities in key Asian markets. Our strength as a company is reflected in our robust financial profile, with significant scale and profitability. In the 12 months ended September 30, we generated $2.2 billion of gross bookings and $875 million of adjusted EBITDA for a 42% adjusted EBITDA margin. We have a highly cash-generative business with $920 million of cash on our balance sheet.","We think we can have the combined company win in mobile. We have one of the largest networks, not just for a gaming company, but across the mobile sector with 474 million monthly active users and 133 million daily active users in Q3. We have a portfolio of best-in-class game franchises on mobile, which are top-grossing in their respective sub-genres, and a multi-year plan to operate our franchises with three new games planned for launch by the end of 2016.","In addition to our focus on our franchise business, our strategy is to leverage our reach and capabilities to answer new genres. We recently launched our first resource management game and expect to release our first mid-core title in 2016. Through this transaction, I think that both King and Activision Blizzard will be able to better serve our players by leveraging our complementary strengths, assets and operational expertise.","We also will have the ability to cross-promote games, providing our players more opportunities to engage with our content. Activision Blizzard has a long history of building, maintaining and growing what I think are iconic and successful franchises, and I believe we can benefit from their experience.","Our third quarter performance reflects the continued strength of our business. Our preliminary third quarter 2015 results include gross bookings of $502 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $180 million for a 38% adjusted EBITDA margin.","Our player metrics for the quarter, 474 million monthly active users, 330 million monthly unique users, and 133 million daily active users underscore our massive player network. Built on the timing of game releases and recent trends, King expects gross bookings in the fourth quarter to be between $475 million and $500 million. We look forward to sharing more with you about our third quarter performance during our earnings call tomorrow.","In closing, I think this deal makes sense because it makes us stronger in the industry, it brings together two world-class teams, and it gives our shareholders an attractive liquidity event. And we look forward to working together with Activision Blizzard and I'm very excited.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Riccardo. As Bobby, Thomas and Riccardo have mentioned, we're incredibly excited to be combining the capabilities and portfolios of our companies together. This transaction enhances Activision Blizzard's current position as the most profitable standalone interactive entertainment company.","We expect accretion to 2016 estimated non-GAAP revenues and earnings per share of approximately 30% based on IBES Consensus estimates. The transaction is also significantly accretive to 2016 estimated free cash flow per share.","We'll be combining Activision Blizzard's trailing 12-month non-GAAP revenues of $4.7 billion with King's trailing 12-month adjusted revenues of $2.1 billion, and combining Activision Blizzard's adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion with King's $0.9 billion over the same period. Importantly, the accretion figures detailed in this presentation do not include potential synergies that could come from cross-promotion and shared capabilities for the combined company.","Activision Blizzard's business today generates the bulk of its revenues from its high-performing Console and PC businesses, which, as we will discuss during our Q3 earnings report, continue to perform very well and are increasingly shifting to higher margin digital channels with increasingly long tails of player engagement and monetization.","King generates virtually all of its revenue from high-margin digital platforms, with the vast majority of it on mobile. The industrial logic of combining these businesses, bringing leadership in gaming across PCs, consoles and mobile platforms, is highlighted by the balanced post-deal revenue mix of roughly one-third coming from each of these platforms. In addition, the combined company will be an online services business with roughly two-thirds of the combined revenue being delivered digitally.","One of the things we've learned from our Blizzard merger is that a broader IP portfolio across more platforms creates a diversified and highly profitable financial profile, which in turn provides us with more capital to reinvest in innovation and to deliver the great content that our fans expect. And with the acquisition of King, we will now have some of the world's leading interactive entertainment franchises, not only on PC and console, but mobile as well.","Now let's turn to balance sheet and look at the sources and uses of capital as well as the combined capitalization of the company. As mentioned earlier, the acquisition of King is an accretive use of Activision Blizzard's offshore cash. The transaction will be funded with $3.4 billion in offshore cash from our balance sheet along with $2.3 billion coming from a fully-committed term loan financing led by Bank of America Meryl Lynch and Goldman Sachs and around $200 million of rollover unvested equity awards. The combined company's capitalization will also maintain a conservative balance sheet with strong liquidity.","Having a strong balance sheet with deep capital resources is very important to us, and the transaction further diversifies and reinforces our financial profile. And as Thomas mentioned, just last night, Moody's upgraded all of our debt rating to investment grade upon announcement of the deal, which is obviously great recognition for the progress we have made in the past two years since we raised debt for the first time.","So in summary, Activision Blizzard's acquisition of King solidifies us as a world leader in interactive entertainment and positions us well for future growth opportunities. The transaction accelerates our current growth strategy as it provides us with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest-growing gaming segment, and it adds to our portfolio of iconic interactive entertainment franchises. It is also highly accretive to earnings and free cash flow per share while still providing King's shareholders with the premium and liquidity. And most importantly for the long-term growth prospects of our business, our acquisition of King brings with it a committed management team with a proven track record and talented employees with aligned objectives to drive innovation to better serve our player communities. So we couldn't be more excited than we are now to have Riccardo, Sebastien, Stephan and the entire King team as part of the Activision Blizzard family.","I will now turn the call back to Thomas to kick off our Q3 results discussion.","Thomas Tippl - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Dennis. I will now turn to Activision Blizzard's earnings results for the third quarter of 2015. Our strong results reflect our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with innovative new intellectual property, broadening our reach by expanding out to new platforms and geographies and driving deeper engagement through regular content updates that delight our audiences.","We outperformed our Q3 targets on revenues, digital growth and earnings per share and we are raising our full-year outlook yet again. We project year-over-year revenue and EPS growth at constant FX. We will continue to invest in our franchises through the holidays to build our install base, given the increasing opportunity of back-end revenues. This investment sets us up for continued organic growth in 2016 and beyond. And of course the addition of King to our portfolio presents additional opportunities for growth ahead.","As we successfully transition from a launch to a year-round engagement model, our audience base and the total amount of time people spend with our franchises continue to grow. In the third quarter, our monthly active users grew by 27% year over year, and the amount of time our communities spent playing Activision Blizzard games grew by 23% year-over-year. Our audiences yet again logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play in the quarter, not including rapidly growing hours spent spectating. You will hear more about our strategic initiatives at Investor Day later this week at BlizzCon, where you will also get to see some of the industry's most exciting eSports Championships. We look forward to seeing you there.","And now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing results.","Eric Hirshberg - President and Chief Executive Officer, Activision Publishing, Inc.","Thanks, Thomas. Activision Publishing delivered another record quarter with record non-GAAP operating income, which at constant FX was up by over 50% versus last year's Q3 performance. We also drove monthly active users up by 17% year-over-year, continued to have three of the top-five next generation games life to-date and had the largest digital revenues in our history both in Q3 and year-to-date. Our results are due to our proven ability to turn great games into long-term franchises with large passionate communities. We strategically and methodically expanded our portfolio to include three such industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round.","We've also just relaunched what we hope could become our fourth major franchise with Guitar Hero Live. We are only two weeks in, but early reception from fans and critics has been very positive. While sell-through comparisons to prior games from five years ago aren't exactly apples-to-apples, our current sell-through is significantly up versus each of the prior two Guitar Hero titles. As you know, unlike past games, we also designed Guitar Hero Live to be a living platform to keep players engaged, and so far, people are responding well, with average engagement per player reaching nearly two hours per day. The game has also been featured in a wide array of the most influential must-have holiday toy lists. All that said, it's still very early and we anticipate that this title will ramp towards the holiday, which is why we have over half of our marketing investment this year still yet to come.","Moving onto Destiny, we launched The Taken King in September with our partners at Bungie to an extremely positive reception from fans and critics. Day one downloads broke Sony PS4 records, day one engagements saw the highest number of active players in Destiny's history. Daily player engagement is now well north of three hours per day, and the Destiny community has now over 20 million registered players \u2013 25 million registered players.","For new players, The Taken King Legendary Edition gives new players the original Destiny game, both expansion packs and The Taken King all for the same price as a regular console game. We've also successfully introduced great new content into the game which allows our players to express themselves and personalize their experience, which is available via in-game purchases and has caused a number of Thriller dances in-game to increase dramatically.","On to Skylanders, which launched at the end of September with Skylanders Superchargers, our first game featuring both vehicle and character toys. I said in our last call that we expect the competition to continue to increase in the toy select category which we invented. And it has. I also said we will continue to lead because we deliver the best games and the biggest innovations. And we are, with Skylanders remaining the biggest franchise in the toy select category year-to-date.","Superchargers and the addition of vehicles into Skylanders have been positively received by both critics and fans. It's also one of our most engaging Skylanders games ever, with more choice per player than last year. But even though Supercharger sell-through is down year-on-year due to increased competition, we are investing in the holiday to maintain our leadership position, and we're optimistic that we'll see category expansion in the holiday. The full game will once again be available on tablet and for the first time on iPhone and Apple TV as well.","As I mentioned on our last call, we are in development on a major new mobile initiative called Skylanders Battlecast which brings cards to life in a free-to-play card battle game. The game is looking great and we expect it to launch in 2016.","Last, but not least, Call of Duty. The year so far has been phenomenal for the franchise, with revenues up double-digit percentages both this quarter and year-to-date. The over-performance has been driven by: 1) higher advanced warfare selling; 2) deeper engagement from our community, driving up performance on season pass, DLC and the new consumable micro-transaction feature Supply Drops; and 3) strong catalogue sales of Black Ops which have ramped with consumer anticipation for Black Ops III.","In fact, monthly active users for Black Ops II grew quarter-over-quarter again to a new record of nearly 12 million monthly active users. And on today's level of engagement for a game, that is now three years old, and only available on Old Gen.","This brings me to our most anticipated launch of the year, Call of Duty Black Ops III. We couldn't be more excited about the launch this Friday. We have strong momentum indicated by a number of factors, but just to name a few, the growing engagement around the past Black Ops titles, the significantly year-on-year lift in pre-orders, consumer sentiment around our marketing assets which is more positive for Black Ops III than any Call of Duty title on record, a great partnership with Sony across consumer, trade and custom PS4 bundles, and our ranking as Neilson's Number One Most Anticipated Title of the Year.","Even more importantly, we've got the game. It is simply awesome. With innovations across single-player, multi-player and of course, zombies, Black Ops III has more content and more surprises packed inside than any game we've made to-date.","So in closing, we've had a great first three quarters built on innovative games that engage our passionate fans and the stage is set for a strong Q4. I look forward to seeing you and sharing more at Investor Day this Friday.","And now, I'll turn the call over to my good friend, Mike, to discuss Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Eric. Q3 was another strong quarter for Blizzard. We had significant activity across our franchises and our MAUs for the quarter were up 50% year-over-year. Blizzard continues to be well positioned for growth. We're operating more franchises on more platforms and in more regions than ever before. We have an exciting upcoming content of late. And we're continuing to foster powerful connections with our community, online, through our pro and amateur eSports programs and at live events like BlizzCon.","Hearthstone in particular had another great quarter, driven by the launch of The Grand Tournament expansion. Along with continued strength on mobile and continued strong performance in all markets, the new expansion helped push engagement for Hearthstone even higher in Q3 than in Q2. Year-over-year engagement was up 77%, leading to Hearthstone's highest ever quarterly revenue. In addition, we recently launched a fully localized version of Hearthstone in Japan. The game already had an established audience in Japan, but we were pleased to provide them, as well as new players, with a version that makes access even easier.","Activity around Hearthstone eSports is also continuing to grow and drive excitement. Over the past few months, we concluded several tournaments feeding into the World Championship at BlizzCon. For World of Warcraft this quarter, we released a key update, which helped maintain stability in the subscriber base, and we're currently at work on the next update. We also had very exciting news at Gamescom, with the announcement of World of Warcraft Legion, our next expansion. Players responded very positively, not only to the new features coming with the expansion, but to the care we're putting into the content. In addition to hosting the World of Warcraft Arena Championship, we'll have more to share on Legion at BlizzCon this week.","On the StarCraft II front, excitement for Legacy of the Void, which will be sold as a standalone product launching on November 10, remains strong. In fact, pre-purchases for Legacy of the Void have continued to outpace those for the previous release, Heart of the Swarm. At the professional level, the StarCraft II World Championship Series competition has been intense and extremely fun to follow. I encourage everyone to tune in at BlizzCon or online for the final round. It's amazing to see some of the most skilled pro gamers in the world in action.","As for Diablo III, we were pleased that it continued to bring in new players in Q3. And in China, it passed the 2 million sales milestone. We released a huge well-received content update in the quarter. All together, we've added a ton of post-launch content to Diablo III, and this reflects our strong commitment to the game and to the community.","Heroes of the Storm also brought in more players in Q3, driven in part by our Diablo-themed content series. While we are still in the early days for the game, it's been great to see the ongoing enthusiasm and support from players as the community continues to come together. We held the regional championships for our Road to BlizzCon series, including the Americas Championship in Las Vegas and the European Championship in Prague over the past few months. These events featured teams with international followings across multiple games, which is exciting for the Heroes of the Storm community and for eSports as a whole. We're looking forward to seeing the winners of the regional championships face off at BlizzCon for the World Championship title.","There is also a lot of ongoing excitement around Overwatch, which just started its beta test last week. We've already had more than seven million players sign up to participate, and that's not including China. We're keeping access limited in order to focus feedback, but we plan to periodically run stress test weekends around the world that will allow many more players to join in. We'll be sharing the latest Overwatch news at BlizzCon, so I hope you will tune in.","As you can tell, we're very excited about BlizzCon and all the eSports action taking place there this week. BlizzCon represents the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the height of eSports competition in our games. It's a massive undertaking and it wouldn't exist without the super-passionate, highly-engaged audience of Blizzard gamers around the world. Tickets again sold out very quickly and we're using more of the Anaheim Convention Center than ever before to host the 25,000-plus live attendees.","The BlizzCon Virtual Ticket is again available this year and viewers will have multiple channels for catching as much of the show as possible. We'll be broadcasting the opening ceremony and all the eSports events for free globally and we're expecting the total audience to again number in the millions. You can tune in via BlizzCon.com.","Duncan Jones will be there to talk about the Warcraft movie and he'll debut the commercial trailer during our opening ceremony. We're also happy to have Wil Wheaton hosting our community contests, and Linkin Park will help close out the show on Saturday night. I look forward to seeing those of you who will be attending, and I encourage everyone else to follow the action online.","Thanks. And I'll turn the call back over to Dennis.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mike. I will now review our better-than-expected Q3 financial results and our raised outlook for Q4 and the full year 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter, on a GAAP basis we generated revenues of $990 million, up 31% year-over-year, and operating margin of 20% and GAAP EPS of $0.17, up $0.09 versus our August guidance. For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis we generated revenues of $1.04 billion and operating margin of 24%, up 190 basis points year-over-year, and EPS of $0.21. We outperformed our August guidance by $110 million on revenue and $0.07 on EPS. At constant FX, our year-to-date revenues are up 5% ahead of last year and EPS is 35% ahead of last year despite the tougher comp with last year's Diablo III expansion and Destiny's full game launch.","Importantly, total digital revenues grew 38% year-over-year or 50% at constant FX to an all-time quarterly record of $697 million. A significant driver of that growth was sales from digital add-on content, which grew 60% year-over-year or 75% at constant FX. Our digital full-game downloads also grew 39% year-over-year or 48% at constant FX, largely driven by the Destiny expansion launch.","There are a few key franchise drivers worth highlighting. Hearthstone had its highest revenue quarter yet with the launch of its expansion, The Grand Tournament, in August. Destiny's operating income grew by a double-digit percentage year-to-date on the back of the launch of The Taken King in September. Skylanders SuperChargers launched to great fan and critical reception, though into a more competitive landscape. Activision's Call of Duty and Blizzard's Diablo III and Heroes of the Storm continued to perform well and attract new players. And World of Warcraft subscribers stabilized at 5.5 million subs in the quarter. And note that this is the last quarter that we plan to provide the subscriber number as there are other metrics that are better indicators of the overall Blizzard business performance.","In terms of EBITDA, in Q3, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $275 million and $1.63 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Operating cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.36 billion, up 39% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $1.25 billion, up 43% year-over-year.","Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $870 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 million. We had no share repurchases in the quarter.","Turning to FX, please note that as discussed on our prior earnings calls, the strong dollar has and will continue to be a headwind this year as our international revenues are translated at lower rates than last year. In Q3, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening of the dollar was $85 million on revenue and $0.05 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $239 million on revenue and $0.16 on EPS.","Now let's turn to our outlook for Q4 and full-year 2015. First for Q4, on a GAAP basis we expect net revenues of $1.22 billion, product costs of 30% and operating expenses of 57%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 39%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 753 million and EPS of $0.09.","For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.15 billion, product costs of 25% and operating expenses of 35%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.82. Note that our guidance is at FX spot rates, as laid out in the accompanying slides on our IR website.","Now to our full-year 2015 numbers. For 2015 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.53 billion, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 49% and GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted shares of 750 million and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07. For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.65 billion, $50 million higher than our August guidance, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 44% and an operating margin of 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.","Once again, we are raising our full-year EPS guidance now to $1.31. We are not fully passing through the entire $0.07 Q3 over-performance largely due to three factors: the first, revenue pull-forward on Destiny and Skylanders from Q4 to Q3 which had an impact of approximately $0.02, cost saving and timing of expenses which pushed into Q4 from Q3, which also was worth $0.02 and additional investments we will be making in Q4 to build the installed base of players across our portfolio, which accounts for the other $0.02.","With the strong back-end monetization we are seeing across our portfolio, we think these investments set us up well heading into next year. Importantly, we expect to end the year with more than half of our revenues coming from digital channels, up double-digit percentage points in aggregate from last year. So in summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends continue to drive our financial results.","Along with these positive digital tailwinds, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off as shown by our year-to-date results. And going forward, with King's franchises in our portfolio, we feel that our strategic growth opportunities across platforms, genres, business models, audience demographics and geographies are more promising than ever. We couldn't be more excited to welcome King and their talented employees into the fold and look forward to taking advantage of the great mutual opportunities we have in front of us.","Lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you in person this Friday at Investor Day at the start of BlizzCon to tell you more about the exciting times ahead. And for those of you who can't attend in person, you can watch the livestream from our IR website.","Thanks again, and now we'll open up the call for questions.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to our first question from Chris Merwin of Barclays.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, great. Thank you. And congrats to everyone on the deal. In the last couple years, the revenue mix for Activision has been evolving more towards a predictable model with free-to-play games and we've seen very good improvements in engagements for console and PC games. And then mobile as a category historically has had different characteristics in terms of the life of games and engagement.","So can you talk about the plan for creating even more predictable revenue streams on mobile and how you can drive consistent engagement and monetization with those mobile games, much as you've done very successfully on other platforms? Thanks.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think I'll let Riccardo get into more details, but I think you've got to recognize King has already a fantastic track record of continuing engagement. Riccardo mentioned some of the incredible number of games people play every day, almost 100 million people coming to King to play their games every day.","I think they have a tremendous track record, and we really only got full appreciation of that as we spent a lot of time over the last few months going with Riccardo and his team through their business, the analytics that they built and the sophistication that their game developments have built in order to make the games fun to play, engaging, rewarding for players, and that is why you see the strong performance that they have put on. And we don't see any reason for that to change. If anything, we think there's opportunity for that to continue to grow and expand, as the teams get stronger and as we will be able to share our very complementary expertise that we have built over decades of being in this business.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think one of the things you realize from the combination is that with now over 0.5 billion players in our network, there's an insatiable demand for great content. And so, now the model is going to start to shift across all of the categories to be able to deliver continuous content, and that should be helpful for more consistent monetization.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Doug Creutz of Cowen & Company.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company","Hey, thanks and congratulations, everybody involved. In your comments, you said you're not assuming any synergies from the deal, but maybe could you talk about what opportunities you think there might be for synergies? Thanks. Especially on the cost side.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So I think from a financial perspective, obviously the deal is already very attractive, but without the assumption of any synergies delivering 30% accretion, and that was an assumption of the deal, only closing by spring. So on a full-year basis, that would be even better.","Now we do think there are obviously opportunities. We talked a lot about already how complementary our relative skill sets are and Bobby just mentioned the incredibly large size of the network overall and, therefore, we're broadening our audience reach, which I think will give all of our franchises a broader access to more people in more geographies, particularly in some of the fastest geographies like Asia.","And I think the same is true vice versa. I think we have a lot of experience in how to build franchises and grow franchises over time and I think some of those skills will be helpful as King continues to grow and mature as a leader in mobile gaming.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think one of the other things that we obviously are not reflecting in our discussions today, but is an important point, if you look at the history of Activision Blizzard, we go back to our founding in 1979, whether it's Infocom, Dynamix, Sierra, Activision, Imagic, we have the largest library of intellectual property in games that exists from any company. And a lot of that intellectual property, you look back in its history, there are tens of millions of players who have experienced those franchises.","With mobile, we now have the opportunity to reach new players in 196 countries around the world and take a lot of that great content that we've built over 35 years and create new content or leverage that content against this new opportunity.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Neil Doshi of Mizuho.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much, guys, and congrats. Bobby, will you guys be investing in King or will King be primarily responsible for funding its own initiatives?","And then, Mike, can you provide any update on Overwatch? It looks like the game will lend itself well for eSports. So if you can provide any color on the eSports front for Overwatch and then how we should be thinking about the distribution strategy going forward, that'd be great.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","From an investment perspective, King will, like Activision and Blizzard, operate as an independent unit. And so they'll generate their own capital, that capital will be available to them to invest against their business opportunities.","One of the big benefits I think they'll get is plugging into the great framework that we've created for long-term strategic planning, and that includes capital allocation. Remember, King generates a lot of operating profit, in fact, more operating profit than virtually any other gaming company that has ever existed. And so they'll be able to continue to generate that operating profit and invest that cash flow in new opportunities.","Michael Morhaime - Chief Executive Officer of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Okay. And on the Overwatch questions, we just entered beta. Feedback from the beta has been extremely positive. On the eSports question, I think that Overwatch has a lot of potential with eSports. We've done some experimenting internally at Blizzard with our own show matches internally at the company. It's very fun to watch. But in terms of announcements about business model or distribution, we're not ready to talk about that today. We'll have more information about Overwatch at BlizzCon.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Bobby. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And moving on, we will go to a question from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne, Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Thank you very much. And I'd like to add my congratulations as well. My question is on Guitar Hero. I appreciate the color and the comparison to the first two franchises in the game's history. If you could maybe refresh our memory on the size of the performance of the original game in the first few years and then just maybe any quantification if possible at retail for Guitar Hero, the new one that's just come out? Thank you.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Obviously, the prior games were the first to reach $1 billion of any video game franchise, so the performance was very strong commercially at its apex. And as I said, the new game's sell-through in week one is up significantly versus the last two games. But as I mentioned, those are five-year old comparisons so not exactly apples-to-apples.","I think the more relevant factors right now are the fact that we've designed this game, the first time for a Guitar Hero game to really have a long tail of engagement with Guitar Hero TV, the world's first playable music video network. We're seeing two hours per day engagement from players who've already purchased the game. And it's going to be a holiday-centric title and we expect to see it ramp during the holiday. And we've got over half of our marketing budget yet to go for the year because of that.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. And good luck.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Arvind.","Operator","And we will hear next from Eric Sheridan of UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bigger picture question for Bobby and the team around capital allocation going forward. With so many choices now between the various divisions as well as the debt holder and equity holder desire to get capital back with deleveraging, maybe just think bigger picture about where capital incrementally is going to get allocated 2016 and beyond and just rank order those opportunities.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks, Eric. Obviously having a strong balance sheet and having access to capital has been a critical and important part of our strategic plan and our process. We've always tried to be very balanced regarding capital allocation. We have significant capital to be able to invest in our business and invest in new opportunities, whether that be inside the Activision business, the Blizzard business or in the future in the King business. And really the greatest governor in that investment is usually related to great development talent and great ideas. And then we try and be disciplined about how we put that investment against those ideas internally.","As it relates to other capital allocation, now obviously taking on a little bit more debt, our near-term priority will be on deleveraging in line with our investment grade profile. Our dividend payout is expected to be largely consistent with our historical approach. And in the short term, the $750 million share buyback authorization will likely not be utilized under current plans. So we feel like we have significant capital resources to be able to invest in our business and still return capital and balance the needs of our various stakeholders.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","And did you have anything further, Mr. Sheridan?","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","No. Thank you very much for that color.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","And so, we'll go to our next question from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Congrats. A few questions, one, are there particular new franchises in the King pipeline that you think are important drivers? Or just more about the long-term value of the current franchises? And then, Bobby, can you just talk about how the success of Hearthstone on mobile may have influenced this deal and your overall thinking of mobile gaming? Thanks.","Riccardo Zacconi - CEO and Co-Founder, King Digital Entertainment","Sure. So it's both. We're having our earnings call tomorrow, so we'll give more details tomorrow, but fundamentally, what we have announced in the past is that we are working on all the key franchises we have, with basically sequels and sister titles. And we announced that by the end of 2016, we will see at least three new titles coming out. And of course at the same time, most of our people are working on new things. So, the target is also to over time crystallize new franchises.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I think the thing that always drives us, Ben, is can we really creatively and in an inspired way figure out new opportunities to delight and engage our audiences? And mobile is allowing us to do that. I think certainly Hearthstone's success, which has been extraordinary, was a catalyst for us to think about the opportunities differently.","And when you look at 196 countries being served by King's footprint and a network of over 400 million players, our intellectual property that goes back to 1980, we really thought that there was a great opportunity. And you're now seeing mobile as a $36 billion market that's growing faster than almost any category. I think the most important thing, though, was that we thought that creatively, we could see sustained franchises that would have perpetual value, where we could continuously put our best creative foot forward.","Operator","And did you have anything further, Mr. Schachter? At this time, we'll go to our next question from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned the cross-promotional opportunity. Any additional color on that point? What games might be candidates near term to promote into King's network? And then separately, any comments on the need to acquire versus build a mobile studio? Clearly, you guys have a great development team, but just want to hear your thoughts on thinking through that decision longer term. Thanks.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Riccardo will take the second part of the question, they've built the best mobile company in the world. And with that network, with hundreds of millions of people, the incredible expertise with inspired, creative talent in all of their studios, as much as we could invest on our own, we couldn't, as quickly or probably in that quality, get to the place that Riccardo and his team have gotten to. So it's a perfect complement to what we do already so well in the categories that we operate in.","Riccardo Zacconi - CEO and Co-Founder, King Digital Entertainment","And it's something in terms of the network composition, if you look at the composition of our network on the free playing side, it's about 60% female, 40% male. But if you then look at the paying side, it's much more accentuated towards a female audience, and this is where one of the big opportunities here is to not only retain better, but in particular market better to our audience, and continue to build out further our network with games which have more focus on males, and that's where I think the opportunities are to tap into the amazing IP portfolio of the Activision business.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, with 0.5 billion players now in our network, or audience members as we like to think of them, there's a lot of opportunity to distribute content to that 0.5 billion player network. And we haven't really announced a lot of the future plans, but some of the things that we've announced recently, you'll see tied very well into what the opportunity is to look at that network and continuously deliver new content to players around the world.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Brian.","Amrita Ahuja - Sr. Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","And we will go to our last question from Drew Crum of Stifel.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, want to follow up on an earlier question on King. Just can you talk about plans to accelerate the rate of content or game output going forward? And then separately, I think there's been some discussion around Destiny favoring micro transactions going forward. Based on the experience you had with The Taken King, can you talk about the strategy with DLC going forward? And can it, along with micro transactions, coexist with this franchise? Thanks.","Riccardo Zacconi - CEO and Co-Founder, King Digital Entertainment","In terms of \u2013 as I said, I think tomorrow you will hear more details, but overall, I think we have a big pipeline of games lined up. A large focus of this pipeline is focused on our franchises with sequels and sister titles for our franchises, and this is a multiyear plan. And then at the same time, we announced in our last earnings call that we are focusing on leveraging the massive network we have to enter new genres.","So we have launched our first title in resource management, Paradise Bay, and you will hear more details tomorrow on its performance. And we have also announced that next year, we're going to launch our first mid-core title. And then beyond that in terms of what can we do with the new portfolio of ideas, I think that the work we started on the deal is closed with the team sitting together and going through the opportunities which this presents.","Robert A. Kotick - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And on Destiny, Drew, I think they're already coexisting. We had a full year of expansions to the game that have been very well received and sold quite well. And more recently, you've seen us introduce smaller in-game purchases that allow people to customize their experience and express themselves. And those have been very well received and have sold well also. So I think we've already shown in those things that micro-transactions can exist and that our community is hungry for more great content.","As far as any shifts in strategy, I don't have any announcements today, but I think we have a lot of options at our disposal. And the reason for that of course is that we have such great engagement with this game. As I said, we're seeing average player times of three hours per day, which is really an astounding figure. And beyond that, we're also bringing in new players. And I think our Legendary Edition going into the holiday gives players the best time ever to jump into the Destiny universe, because you've got the original Destiny game, both the expansion packs and The Taken King for the price of a regular console game. So this has already brought a lot of new players in, and we hope to see even more as we head into the holiday.","Dennis M. Durkin - Chief Financial Officer","Great. So thanks, Drew, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We're obviously very excited about the new announcements today, and welcome the whole King organization inside of Activision Blizzard, and we look forward to seeing many of you and hopefully speaking to many of you online this Friday at our Investor Day, which will be Friday morning Pacific Time, right before the opening ceremony of BlizzCon. So thanks, everyone, for joining us today.","Operator","And that does conclude this call. We would like to thank everyone for their participation today."],"657":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Chris Hickey. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Hickey","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s Activision Blizzard\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 conference call. With us are: Bobby Kotick, CEO; Coddy Johnson, COO; and Dennis Durkin, company\u2019s CFO and President of Emerging Businesses. And for Q&A, Rob Kostich, President of Activision; J. Allen Brack, President of Blizzard; Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King; and Humam Sakhnini, President of King will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available for the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect. A number of factors could cause the company\u2019s actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings, including our 2017 annual report on Form 10-K, and those on the slides that is showing.

We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com, for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures.","There\u2019s also an earnings presentation, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results.","And now I\u2019d like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Bobby Kotick","Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. We once again achieved record results in 2018. We delivered record GAAP revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for both fourth quarter and the year. For 2018, we generated record GAAP revenues across all three platforms and both Activision and King achieved record segment financial results. While we had record performance in 2018, it didn't quite live up to our expectations. We didn't execute as well as we hoped to in 2018 and our current outlook for 2019 falls below what is possible in an industry filled with growth opportunities.","We measure our success by growth in reach, engagement and player investment and while we had record financial results in 2018, we didn't achieve the reach engagement and player investment goals we set for ourselves. 2019 will require significant change to enable us to achieve our long-term goals and objectives. We're making changes to enable our development teams to create better content for our biggest franchises more quickly. Across our key franchises, we're adding development talent to ensure our teams can deliver exactly what our fans have come to expect from our games, a consistent flow of compelling content.","We'll also increase our focus on adjacent opportunities with demonstrated potential like esports for Overwatch League and Call of Duty. We're stepping up production on our incubation efforts faster and increasing our investment in live services, in our tools, in our Battle.net platform and in new areas like our fast-growing esports and advertising efforts, but all with an intense focus on excellence, so we never disappoint our players.","Our pipeline is excellent and our development talent the very best in the world. But we need to refocus our efforts so that our development and production resources are better aligned with our priorities. We're reducing or eliminating investment in games and initiatives that weren't living up to player expectations, or our leadership teams have determined may not live up to player expectations in the future. To drive improved execution and to fund development investment, we will in certain parts of the business reduce complexity and duplication in our back office functions, consolidate certain commercial operations, and revamp our consumer marketing capabilities to reflect our continued migration to a largely digital network.","While this isn't a shift in our strategy, achieving better execution requires change, change that requires new leadership and organizational commitment to change. We operate in an industry with proven growth and real potential and we haven't grown at the rates that reflect the opportunities our industry affords. We have new business unit leadership committed to serving our players, our employees and our shareholders. And I'm also very pleased to have Dennis Durkin back as CFO and overseeing our emerging businesses. His steady responsible stewardship of our capital and his strong relationships with his colleagues served us well during his five-year prior tenure as CFO.","As always, I want to thank our customers, our players and our partners, but especially today our employees and our shareholders for their commitment and their support.","And now Coddy?","Coddy Johnson","Thanks, Bobby. Before we discuss the important steps we are taking to reinforce the foundation for future growth, let's first review our quarterly results. In Q4, we generated record GAAP revenues of $2.38 billion including the net deferral of $454 million. Net bookings were also a record at $2.84 billion. We generated Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.84 and Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.90 also both Q4 company records including a net deferral of $0.39. While GAAP revenue net bookings and both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were company records, our net bookings fell short of our outlook, due to factors I'll explain in our segment results.","Activision Q4 segment revenues grew 6% year-over-year to $1.41 billion and operating income increased 14% year-over-year to $723 million with monthly active users increasing double-digits quarter-over-quarter to 53 million. The primary driver for the Activision segment was Call of Duty, which generated more upfront sales than any other console franchise worldwide in 2018, a feat the franchise has accomplished for 9 of the last 10 years.","Black Ops 4 sold through more units than Black Ops 3 in its launch quarter with PC units more than tripling and engagement was strong with average hours per player increasing versus Black Ops 3 as players enjoyed Blackout, Multiplayer and Zombies. We also saw a significant shift to digital this the year, with full game downloads representing over 40% of console sell-through versus approximately 30% for World War II. However, sales of Black Ops 4 in the second half of the quarter were below our outlook, due to weaker-than-expected retail demand, lower-than-anticipated pricing and other promotional activities that didn't meet expectations. Although Black Ops 4 in-game net bookings started off slower than expected following the introduction of the new in-game system, we were encouraged by the response we saw when we introduced more compelling content with the second season events in late Q4.","Turning to Destiny. The mutual agreement with Bungie to sell back the commercial rights to Destiny and eliminate our ongoing investment in the game did not have a material impact on Activision's segment operating income in the quarter, but will free up capital and development resources for the future. We also continued to drive strong performance for the beloved intellectual property from our library, following the successful launch of Spyro in Q4. And the ongoing contribution of Crash Bandicoot, which has sold in over 10 million units since its 2017 release, again highlights the enduring nature of our classic franchises.","Overall, Activision delivered meaningful year-over-year growth for segment revenue and for operating income. And with the changes we are implementing in 2019, we expect to drive even stronger performance in the years to come. ","Blizzard was a more nuanced story in Q4. On the one hand, we grew Q4 segment revenues to $686 million and operating income to $241 million. And Blizzard had 35 million monthly active users in the quarter, as Overwatch and Hearthstone saw sequential stability and World of Warcraft saw expected declines post the expansion release this summer.","On the other hand, the relatively consistent monthly active user trends for Blizzard's communities were not matched by in-game net bookings, which continue to soften. In particular, Overwatch and Hearthstone, both experienced sequential declines in net bookings from players making in-game purchases. Lastly, Blizzard results benefited from the continued success of our business in China and the extension of our partnership with NetEase. Building on our 11-year joint venture, the expanded agreement runs until January 2023 and reflects the substantial value and opportunity for Blizzard's content in China.","While the majority of the economics from our renewed arrangement will be recognized over the next four years, Q4 did benefit from the agreement, which was contemplated in our outlook. Now I'll go into more detail in a minute, but increasing the flow and the frequency of compelling in-game content and upfront releases to serve the needs of our players is the number one goal set by the new Blizzard leadership team going forward.","Finally, King grew segment revenue and operating income year-over-year as it continued to recover from the network incident experienced in the second quarter. Q4 segment revenues grew 5% year-over-year to $543 million and operating income increased 28% year-over-year to $207 million. King monthly active users of 268 million grew sequentially for the first time since we acquired the business in Q1 2016, driven by the successful launch of Candy Crush Friends in October.","Candy Crush Friends is seeing strong monetization and retention trends, contributing incremental growth for the Candy Crush franchise, which overall grew net bookings and monthly active users, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. This encouraging performance sets the foundation for King to ramp its marketing support and drive further growth for Friends in 2019. Now importantly, our advertising initiative continued to gain momentum, growing net bookings over 50% sequentially and again profitably, as the team continues to execute against this sizable opportunity.","Now taking a step back and looking at our full year results for 2018. We delivered record GAAP revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS and net bookings. We continue to make encouraging progress in mobile, advertising and esports. However, in-game execution was inadequate for some of our franchises and we saw weaker than anticipated retail demand.","As you will hear from Dennis, our 2019 outlook assumes that we will not improve in-game monetization as quickly as we would like, and that it is a transition year where we have less new major content to release than we should. So we have worked with our new business unit leaders to undertake a comprehensive examination of our business to determine the changes we need to make to improve execution and capitalize on the substantial long-term growth opportunities for our company. We've determined that we need to refocus our best resources on our biggest opportunities and to remove an unnecessary level of complexity and duplication that is built up in certain parts of the business.","We have, therefore, developed a clear plan for this year to refocus and reinforce the foundation for growth. This refocus includes initiatives developed by our new business unit leaders each of whom has demonstrated the ability to combine creative excellence with the commercial focus on profitable growth.","First, we are investing more in development for our biggest internally owned franchises across upfront releases, in-game content, mobile and geographic expansion. Second, we are deprioritizing initiatives that are not meeting our expectations and reducing certain non-development and administrative-related costs across our business. Third, we are integrating our global and regional sales and go-to-market partnerships and sponsorships capabilities across the business, enabling us to better leverage talent, expertise and scale on behalf of our business units.","Our restructuring plan sheds investment and less productive non-strategic areas of our business and will result in a net headcount reduction of approximately 8% while also driving a significant increase in investment, focus and capabilities around our biggest franchises. We're confident that over time this plan will enable our teams to accelerate the delivery of high-quality content to our communities.","Specifically as we reallocate resources and hire new talent, we are planning for the number of developers working on Call of Duty, Candy, Overwatch, Warcraft, Hearthstone and Diablo to increase in aggregate by approximately 20% over the course of the coming year. For Call of Duty, Activision management expects additional resources to deliver more frequent content updates and events for the franchise and accelerate its expansion across platforms and geographies.","We also intend to build on our experience with the Overwatch League to launch a professional city-based Call of Duty league that drives franchise engagement and represents a sizable incremental economic opportunity. We are also increasing coordination across our Call of Duty studios with unified development leadership and more unified tools and technology to create a more consistent user experience and leverage our development scale and expertise.","For Candy, King management will increase its focus on growing reach and monetization with in-game content features and events with a substantial increase in Candy development resources. The advertising business will continue to add engineering and direct sales resources to support our plans for strong revenue and operating income growth in 2019 and beyond. The Overwatch team is also growing, as it focuses on delivering a significant content pipeline in the coming years and the Overwatch League remains a key strategic focus where we will grow the number of resources involved to drive an expanded product and year-on-year revenue growth.","World of Warcraft is an example of a franchise, where Blizzard has already established a regular cadence of major content and in-game operations. Additionally, Blizzard is investing in other Warcraft games working on more ways for the community to engage, with this enduring and beloved franchise. For Hearthstone, additional development resources will help to release content that is both broader and deeper, and to optimize the game to deliver an even better mobile experience for its global audience. And Diablo's development headcount will grow substantially, as the teams work on several projects underway for the franchise as well as the global launch of Diablo Immortal.","Overall, Blizzard's management is reinforcing its pipeline with more resources than ever before to support planned mobile titles, several PC and console releases and WoW\u2019s continued cadence of content.","Finally, as a company, we will continue to invest in breakthrough new ideas and incubation, with focused resources and some of our best creative talent. With 2019 set to be a quieter year for upfront launches now is the right time to implement this plan. Work is already underway across the company as we speak. We expect to have completed North American components of our plan by the end of Q1, with implementation of the international components by end of year. And we have already started to increase developer resources on our biggest franchises, and we'll be aggressively hiring talent in the coming quarters.","As we look forward to the coming years, we plan for all of our major franchises to be operating at scale and capitalizing on opportunities that include, robust ongoing live operations and regular content launches both large and small, strong mobile experiences available for all of the communities to enjoy, new engagement and monetization models including where appropriate esports and advertising. And underpinning all our franchises will be our deep relationships with growing and vibrant communities which are increasingly direct and digital. In short, we are refocusing the entire company to return to the franchise focus that has fueled our long-term success and to better leverage the scale of our business for future growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Dennis to provide our outlook for 2019. Dennis?","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Coddy. Before I discuss the 2019 and Q1 outlook, I just wanted to take a moment to say how excited I am to be back and to return to a more day-to-day operational position as the CFO as well as the leader of our emerging businesses. We have a tremendous team and although we have a lot of work in front of us, I see a stronger pipeline and more opportunities for long-term growth than ever before.","As Bobby and Coddy mentioned, 2019 will be a transition year for us as we implement change to enable our teams to create better content for our biggest franchises more quickly. Given limited frontline releases, the organizational work underway and the current competitive environment, we're planning for this year to be down year-over-year.","I'll first go through the segments including slate to provide some context for the outlook starting with Activision. The main driver for the segment will be the Call of Duty franchise. Heading into 2019, we have momentum to build on given the launch of Black Ops 4 with the franchise yet again number one globally in upfront sales in 2018. We will continue to optimize in-game content this year to drive ongoing engagement and player investment. And in Q4, we will have another major launch for the franchise that will appeal broadly to both existing and new fans with what I can only describe now as a great step forward in the franchise that is also rooted in some of the franchise's most important history. We have high expectations for the game, but for modeling purposes, we are conservatively planning on upfront Q4 unit sales to be lower than Black Ops 4.","We will also bring Call of Duty to mobile with our partner Tencent. Although, as you would expect, we take a conservative approach in assuming no material operating income from this initiative this year. Outside of Call of Duty, we will release Sekiro in Q1 and our strategy of reimagining classic franchises will continue with Crash Team Racing on multiple platforms later this year. We will not generate material revenue from Destiny in 2019, following the sale of publishing rights to Bungie. Excluding Destiny in both years, our outlook is roughly flat for net bookings for the rest of the Activision segment in 2019.","Turning to Blizzard. We expect materially lower financial performance this year. 2018 benefited from the release of World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, whereas we are not planning a major frontline release for Blizzard in 2019. And Blizzard exited 2018 with softness for its in-game revenues that will take time to stabilize and return to growth. While these factors will weigh on Blizzard's financials this year, looking further ahead, Blizzard's pipeline of PC, console and mobile content is richer than ever and we expect a significant addition of development resources to accelerate the pace of delivery over time.","Finally, King is entering 2019 with momentum as it continues to recover from the network incidents it experienced in Q2. The business will continue to face tougher comps in the first few months of the year until it crosses the anniversary of this disruption. Nonetheless, we expect segment revenue to grow modestly year-over-year driven by growth for the Candy franchise and the continued ramp of our advertising business. Bringing all this together to the total company level, our outlook incorporates net bookings declining 13% year-over-year. The Blizzard segment represents the majority of the year-over-year change given its 2019 release slate and in-game performance. The lower net bookings from Destiny is also a factor.","The lower net bookings performance translates into lower segment operating income and our outlook assumes a high teens year-over-year decline. Again, the Blizzard segment drives the majority of this change. Activision segment operating income is also expected to be lower due to the following factors. First, we are planning to invest more in Call of Duty this year including the support platform and geographic expansion. And second, we will not generate meaningful operating income from Destiny this year. Although, I would note, that this is consistent with our planning assumptions where we do have continued publishing the game. King segment operating income is planned to be roughly flat, as we invest in Candy marketing to build on the encouraging start for Candy Friends.","Finally, I would note that we are planning for a higher tax rate this year. While our 2018 GAAP tax rate included one-time benefits from U.S. tax reform and our IRS settlement, both our GAAP and non-GAAP 2019 rates incorporate the full impact of new international tax provisions. With that context, I'll detail the financial guidance for 2019 and Q1. On a GAAP basis for 2019, we expect revenues of $6.03 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $275 million. We expect net bookings of $6.3 billion; product cost, game operations and distribution expenses of 24%; operating expenses including software amortization of 56%; and a GAAP-only charge of approximately $150 million relating to the restructuring plan Coddy outlined. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP net interest expense of 0, a GAAP tax rate of 24%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 775 million and EPS of $1.18. For 2019 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 24% and operating expenses including software amortization of 46%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 20%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.85, which includes GAAP deferrals of $0.25.","For Q1 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $1.72 billion, which includes the recognition of GAAP deferrals of $540 million. We expect net bookings of $1.18 billion; product costs, game operations and distribution expenses of 20%; operating expenses including software amortization of 57%; and we expect approximately $100 million of the GAAP-only restructuring charge to be booked in Q1. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP net interest expense of zero, a GAAP tax rate of 24% GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $772 million and EPS of $0.39. And for Q1 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost, game operations and distribution expenses of 20% and operating expenses including software amortization of 43%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate of 22% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, which includes the recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.43.","Turning to capital allocation. I wanted to spend a moment quickly review our historical track record just as context. As most of you know, we have always taken a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. We view a strong balance sheet as a strategic asset and while our focus in recent years has been on paying down debt with over $4 billion repaid in the last five years, we've also returned almost $11 billion to our shareholders over the last decade with around $2 billion in dividends and $9 billion in share repurchases. With this balanced approach in mind, our board has authorized the following; a 9% increase in our dividend to $0.37 per share payable in May; and also a new two-year $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization.","Before I conclude, I wanted to summarize the company's position heading into 2019. We continue to have a tremendous potential in front of us. Our combination of leading owned franchises a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class developer talent and geographic platform and business model diversity creates a powerful foundation for longer-term growth. We must and will relentlessly focus on the world-class execution, business excellence and quality content delivery that has been the backbone of our company and business for many years. Our plan to increase our focus on our core franchises is consistent with that approach and I'm confident that executing against our plan will position us to deliver strong results and shareholder value over the long-term.","Looking ahead, I look forward to updating you on our results as we make progress throughout this year. Now I welcome our business leaders, Riccardo, Humam, Rob and J as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Sebastian","Great. Thanks for taking my question. And welcome back, Dennis. I appreciate the comments on the restructuring and hoping you can provide a little more color on the reallocation of resources and in particular discuss, how and when we can expect that effort to translate to a return to growth? Thanks.","Coddy Johnson","Sure. Thanks, Colin. This is Coddy. I'll take that one. I guess stepping back to what as we shared during the call, our plan is focused on delivering growth in reach, engagement and player investment and there's really big three areas of it. One is refocusing on our own franchises where we feel like we have the highest opportunity for growth. Two, is making sure we have the right amount of development resources to then go deliver great content within those franchises to our player communities, and then where appropriate benefiting from company scale and removing duplication and inefficiency.","And so to do this with the new leadership teams there's three specific and important changes as we head into 2019 that we plan to deliver. The first is investing in development on our main franchises, as I mentioned a 20% increase to drive the content in cadence and pace. Second is reducing and eliminating initiatives that are not meeting our expectations and also areas where we can find duplication and remove it. And then third, integrating our global and regional sales and go to market and partnerships and sponsorships so we can leverage scale. We know we have a global fan player base that is looking for content on a regular cadence, to come more quickly and to come across multiple platforms and we think we have set-up each of our operating divisions to be able to deliver on that. But we also think we better set up the company to be able to deliver on that as we leverage those areas, where scale can really help to bring our content and our franchises out to the world.","Now as for timing, and as we see those effects we're only guiding to 2019 today, but what I can say is that, we are confident in the growth opportunity ahead of us. Our increased focus, our investment, leaning into our big franchises is a sign that we are headed towards a place where growth given the right resources, given the right plan can be realized.","Colin Sebastian","Thanks.","Chris Hickey","Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Evan Wingren","Yeah. Just wondering if you could provide us a bit more commentary on the components of your guidance for fiscal 2019, how you see your franchises performing and how you see the seasonality of the year unfolding?","Dennis Durkin","Yeah. Thanks, Evan. It's Dennis here. Happy to provide some color on that, I guess first just kind of helicoptering up a little bit. There are a few things to think about as it relates to our outlook. I think the first point is obviously the one relative to our release slate which is diminishing this year or down this year, but it does obviously impact our outlook. In addition, the in-game softness that we saw exiting 2018 caused us to enter the year at a slightly lower trajectory than last year. And although, we have a plan to turn that around it's going to take some time. So we don't actually assume a full recovery of that in 2019. And then, we also are pretty conservative in terms of how we plan for some of the newer things in our pipeline like our mobile games. We do obviously shoot for breakout hits, but it's very hard to obviously prudently plan for those in your outlook. So we're obviously more conservative on that.","And then the last piece, I would just say is relative to our tax rate. You heard a few of the comments about it being up, because some of our international considerations this year. So those are the main considerations, I guess just relatively to the overall outlook. ","As it relates to seasonality, given the limited number of product launches this year, Q4 will again be a very important quarter. Again, we've tried to take a prudent approach relative to that assuming that Call of Duty units are down year-over-year in our outlook. I would say that the team is building this new game for us in Activision is building what they believe is the best Call of Duty we've ever built. And so that team is certainly targeting growth even though we haven't put it in our outlook in that fashion. So I guess just stepping back our approach relative to guidance and my approach to guidance is really \u2013 for this year is really consistent with how we set guidance in the past. And a careful approach to guidance, I think is always appropriate, but particularly this year given the changes in the industry and the amount of work we need to accomplish this year. So thanks for the question Evan.","Christ Hickey","Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator","We will now take a question from Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. This is for Rob. Can you quickly tell us about how you're thinking about leading Activision? And then give us an update on the Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 launch and how that game is trending so far. Thanks.","Rob Kostich","Hey. Thanks for the question, Ray. So I've been at Activision for about 15 years now and I've touched just nearly every part of the business. And what I really look forward to is taking all those experiences and applying it in this broader capacity. At a high level, I'm really focused on two things right now. It's our players and our people. Very simply, I'm very committed to our players and overdelivering on their expectations. That is just something we must do. Now behind it all it is our people. They're world-class. They are our foundation and we want to continue to invest in them and to create an environment for them to do their best work.","Now if I step back from an Activision perspective and look at the business, we do have a lot of opportunities right in front of us, in Mobile, in PC expansion, in geographic expansion, especially in Asia, in eSports, which was mentioned on the call already, and of course in business models that continue to arise in our industry and create opportunity for us. And as a division, we have specific initiatives against each of these in progress that we're excited about. ","Now in terms of Black Ops 4, as Coddy mentioned, it delivered better unit sell-through than Black Ops 3 in its launch quarter. So what we have is a really strong foundation of players right now and our biggest objective is driving ongoing engagement with our community.","Now, the good news is, we have our best in-game content coming still. Our next event on February 19 will be what we believe is our biggest and best in-game event and it's going to have significant updates across all modes and we're looking forward to see how that lands and resonates with the community. And then if I am looking further ahead to what Dennis mentioned, it's worth mentioning again, this fall's launch I think is going to resonate very powerfully with our community. It is an amazing game. It's going to feature an entirely new campaign, a huge and expansive multiplayer world and of course some fun co-op gameplay. But from day one, we\u2019re going to be really excited, every time we've shown this title internally it's just created a ton of buzz. Now I wish I could tell you a lot more right now, but unfortunately you're going to have to wait, but I think it's going to be really worth it. We can't wait to share it with the world. So thanks for the question Ray.","Bobby Kotick","And I would just add, Ray, its Bobby, that when you look over the last decade of Call of Duty content, I think that Rob is underselling what the internal enthusiasm is. I haven't seen this much enthusiasm that I can remember almost ever. So we're excited about the fall release of Call of Duty content.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks again for taking my question.","Chris Hickey","Thanks. Operator?","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my question. One for probably J. I guess, the question, J., is what is the new management team doing just to make sure that Blizzard is back on track to executing as one of the top studios as it should be. Thanks.","J. Allen Brack","Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think one of the things that I feel like it's important for us to talk about is we're bit of a new leadership team. And as we've come together, it's clear that we believe a lot in our future and that we have a lot to prove from both the game and kind of a content delivery standpoint. I think we have a huge amount of opportunity. We have fantastic IPs. We have lots of games that we want to create and we have a very passionate community that is hungry for all of the things that we can produce. So we have two big goals going forward. The first one is, of course, make excellent videogames. The second is, to find ways to deliver more content to our player communities. To meet these goals, we need to work to increase the amount of content that we're delivering. Right now we have the largest lineup of PC, console and mobile games that we've ever had, and we're working to meaningfully increase the development capacity and the development headcount.","That investment in development talent is -- has really required us to make some difficult trade-offs. We're going to -- as Coddy mentioned, we're going to reduce our non-development positions in our offices around the world, specifically looking at our SG&A and non-core business units. This was a very, very difficult decision, I'd say it\u2019s a top five career difficult moment for me personally, but we're committed to doing everything that we can to help get us into a good position going forward. We really want to serve our players and we want to serve our communities in the best possible way and be a great creative organization. As difficult as kind of all this is, I think we're happy about the things that we're working on. We're working very hard to live up to our mission and we really look forward to the community and you all seeing the results of this increased development work over time.","Bobby Kotick","Can I just say, it's really terrific for the company to have J's leadership. He's humble about his experiences. When you think about World of Warcraft and Hearthstone and the Warcraft franchise, it's been one of the most successfully led franchises in all of video games and we couldn't be happier to have J in the role that he's in.","Brian Nowak","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take your question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much. I guess, my question is given one of your competitors' decision to launch a free-to-play Battle Royale game, are you rethinking the monetization model for any of your game maybe including Overwatch?","Coddy Johnson","Sure. This is Coddy. Thanks for the question. I guess, maybe a couple of key points. First, stepping back, one of the things that sometimes gets lost in the discussion on economic models is the player and game experience itself. Our North Star is to deliver a compelling and engaging gameplay full stop. Without that there are no economics. The second point is that the economic model has to work with the franchise and the community and the gameplay. They need to work to reinforce each other and we feel like we're in a pretty unique position, honestly across the industry and that we have multiple business models running at scale across our franchises today. We have free-to-play games, micro transaction-based games, games with an upfront charge or with a subscription. We also now have advertising, which is growing as well. And we think that provides a range of options for our product and development teams to look across and pair the best economic model with the best gameplay experience.","One thing we know though is that we need to be able to move more quickly and we need to be able to rapidly evolve with the demands of our players in the market. And that's why as I mentioned, we are investing significant development resources in our core franchises to be able to move more quickly on behalf of our players and to be able to take advantage of new business models. On the free-to-play part of your question in particular, obviously the most proven platform is mobile. So as we increasingly bring Activision and Blizzard IP to the mobile space, you will see us deploy more free-to-play models. Embedded in your question that was also the fact that we see competitors now on PC and console going free-to-play and I just emphasized again that we believe our investment and resources coupled with our strong IP leaves us in a really good position to take advantage of evolving business models in our industry.","The last thing, I'd say and it's just worth mentioning is that the success we see with titles like Call of Duty or even recent competitive launches shows that a really well-built well-polished AAA experience for players can come still with an upfront charge and it can be a great player experience and a great business model. So looking ahead, we'll continue to evaluate all our games across our franchises and use the models that we think best both for the player experience and for our business.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company.","Mike Hickey","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just focusing on your key segment, I'm hopeful you can provide more color on your Candy Friends launch, I guess, how \u2013 it went from your perspective and how it's performing now would be really helpful. Thank you.","Humam Sakhnini","Hey, Mike. It's Humam here. Thanks for the question. So Candy Crush Friends launched in October. It's been a great addition to the franchise. The game has really got a lot of great new game modes and mechanics and we really think it's our most polished title ever. And it's brought a lot of the franchise characters to life like never before. What I would say that after many years of the teams operating the Candy franchise at scale they\u2019ve really put all their learnings into that Candy Friends experience. And what we're seeing is that's paid-off. It's really showing some strong retention and the game\u2019s per player monetization metrics are well ahead of where the franchise\u2019s other titles were at a similar point post launch.","And again, it really reiterates and demonstrates how kind of the years of experience operating \u2013 candy were funneled into the Candy Friends title. So we're off to a great start and we have more plans in 2019. The way I think about it is we're still in launch mode with Candy Friends and this is a year where we make marketing investments to support the title. And while we're doing that, the teams have some really strong plans to drive engagement and monetization trends with some proven features in the pipeline to continue to delight the players. So overall very pleased with the momentum, and I expect that the game will really help drive the Candy Crush franchise growth in 2019.","Mike Hickey","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","Tim O\u2019Shea","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So with Overwatch League season two launching soon, I just thought it made sense for an update on that franchise. It's been over two years since the game launched and we've talked on prior calls and again on this call about the lower revenue levels. So I'm wondering, what the strategy to address this issue? And does Blizzard have the development capacity to deliver sufficient levels of new content into this franchise? Thank you.","J. Allen Brack","Thanks for the question. This is J. I think it's important to mention the job the team has done with Overwatch. We feel really strong about the overall IP, the universe, the characters and the story potential, along with the global appeal for the game and we really built Overwatch League around that with early good results. Delivery of more content in Overwatch is something that's really important and something that we're focused on. The team is delivering new heroes and new maps and new experiences. And as you mentioned, the game revenue has declined recently. I think the community engagement with the game remains strong.","There are a lot of new ideas for the Overwatch franchise. We feel like, the Overwatch that you know is just a small part of what we can imagine for the overall franchise and the team has a very clear plan. In order to deliver on that, we're going to increase the size of the Overwatch team meaningfully. But keep in mind that that's going to \u2013 we need to balance the existing live content with new products and different kind of support for Overwatch League. I'm really confident that the community will be very excited when we kind of release the things that we're working on.","Regarding Overwatch League specifically, we saw a great community response and lots of early success. That took a lot out of focus. But overall, we think it's the right decision. It's been the right decision for the game and the franchise. We're about to kick off the second season and that's going to start on February 14. That will introduce eight new city teams. It will introduce home and away matches for some teams for the very first time. And the first match that's actually going to kick off is going to be a repeat of the grand finals between London and Philadelphia. So overwatchleague.com is where you can see that.","Chris Hickey","Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. ","Brandon Ross","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you could provide a little more color on your rationale for parting ways with Bungie and the Destiny franchise and kind of what happened with that game. Thanks.","Coddy Johnson","Sure. Thanks, Brandon. This is Coddy. I guess let me say first that we're confident that this was the right decision for both parties. Bungie gets to focus on the IP they created and we get to focus on our biggest opportunities on our biggest franchises with our best resources. Our decision was reach the mutual agreement with Bungie to sell back the commercial rights. And for us, at least, it was rooted really in our strategy overall. First, as you know, we didn't own the underlying Destiny IP and we do for all our other major franchises, which we think is not just a differentiator for us in the industry, but also controlling the underlying IP gives us the chance to move with new experiences and new engagement models which also come with new revenue streams and of course structurally higher economics when you own the IP.","And that leaves to probably the second factor in our decision process, which is Destiny, it is highly critically acclaimed, high quality content, but it was not meeting our financial expectations. As we went through at the end of the year our financial planning for 2019, it indicated that Destiny would not have been a material contributor in operating income to our business.","And third, we had internal resources supplementing Bungie's work, and that means they're tying up one of our scarcest resources, which is developer time, which now under the arrangement we have reached, will be freed up after short transition period. So late last year when we're exploring all our options on Destiny, in November after earnings release we learned that Bungie was willing to acquire our rights and we engage discussions with them and ultimately wound up consummating the deal in late December, and it was a mutual amicable agreement. And I just emphasize I really do think for both parties this is the right path forward and it allows us to go implement the plan that we talked about today.","Brandon Ross","Thank you.","Chris Hickey","Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust.","Matthew Thornton","Hey, good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if you could just update us on just timing around some of the mobile initiatives at both Blizzard and Activision, including China as well as rest of world. Any update or color there will be helpful. Thanks, everyone.","Coddy Johnson","Sure. Thanks, Matt for the question. This is Coddy again. As you heard in our prepared remarks, mobile is a top priority for us and we think it's one of our largest opportunities particularly with our global IP, which we think is really well-positioned to bring to the mobile platform. We see this every day with King where you have a franchise at scale globally, but we also see it with other great franchise like Hearthstone where bringing that game to mobile brought in tens of millions of new players that are engaging in an ongoing and deep way with us.","The thing to note is mobile game team is a lot smaller than PC or console. They still require time to prototype and to test and particularly for us and our franchises where we have high community expectations when we bring them to market we want to do it right. That said, part of the announcements today and the work that we're doing and that we highlighted is to make sure that we're adding the right resources and enough resources to accelerate our mobile pipeline. Given the size of our opportunities it's not just internal. We are working with external partners. We have multiple projects underway across the portfolio in various stages of development. And as you know we've announced to Call of Duty mobile and also Diablo Immortal.","And you asked about both in status. They're both hard at work. We have no additional announcements to make at this time, but in both cases we're looking to make sure that the IP is really well represented. For Diablo it's an authentic and immersive deep experience that we think getting it there has large global potential and so it matters to get it right and we'll share more about our titles and release dates as that comes to fruition.","Chris Hickey","Operator, we have time for one last question please.","Operator","And will take our last question from Kunaal Malde.","Kunaal Malde","Thank you. You mentioned that King advertising net bookings were more than 50% sequentially. It would be great if you could provide us with some more color and your expectations in 2019?","Bobby Kotick","Go ahead, Humam.","Humam Sakhnini","I was just going to say, Bobby, that I mean, let\u2019s step back and just think about the business in a few phases. First, we decided that we really needed an ad product that worked and is differentiated. So, we went and invested in the right teams to drive that, and I think it's paid off. We have a pretty good differentiated native ad product that is working quite well with player satisfaction on the inside and increasing on monetization. And in 2017 and what you saw in 2018 was we scaled the business by lighting up more of our inventory and adding more impressions in our network, and that was a key driver as we started scaling the business. And we hit some important financial milestones in the year in 2018, first, profitability in Q1, and then growth in every quarter after that.","And I think the ad business is going to start to be meaningfully contributing to the King overall. So we expect it to cross the $100 million booking threshold this year. And as I look ahead, I think on the next phase about where the ad business heading is about continued scaling. So we will continue to scale more and in fact the ad network at King and we have more work to do there to enable it in more of our games and we're continuing to educate our demand partners on kind of the power of our ad product and there's really good momentum there. And I think kind of after that, we will think about even more ways to deploy the ad product. It could be in new mobile experiences or esports. I think the team has a ton of learnings and potential that's could be applied in there.","Bobby Kotick","Yeah, and I would just add. I think it's an excellent team. The ad product is excellent. They've started to make real inroads in getting people to better understand what the opportunity for advertisers is and I think that I'll just echo Humam's sentiment that there's a lot of momentum in that business.","Chris Hickey","And that I think concludes our call today. I just wanted to on behalf of our team here thank you all for your time and engagement today. And we look forward to seeing many of you on the road or up to our next earnings call. So thanks very much.","Operator","And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"318":["Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  1, 2013  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Kristin Mulvihill Southey - Former Vice President of Investor Relations","Robert A.

Today's call is being recorded.","And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today's call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Ms. Kristin Southey. Please go ahead.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's second quarter 2013 conference call.","With me today are Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard; Thomas Tippl, COO of Activision Blizzard; Dennis Durkin, CFO of Activision Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing; and Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainty. As indicated in the slide that is showing, a number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.","Such factors include, without limitation, sales levels; current macroeconomic conditions; increasing concentration of titles; shifts in consumer spending trends; our ability to predict consumer preferences among competing genres and hardware platforms; maintenance of key relationships, including the ability to attract, retain and develop key personnel and developers that can create high-quality hit titles; the seasonal and cyclical nature of our industry; changing business models, including digital delivery of content; competition, including from used games; possible declines in prices; product returns; price protection; product delays; the adoption rate and availability of new hardware and related software, particularly during the console transition; the rapid changes in technology and industry standards; the current regulatory environment; litigation and associated costs; protection of proprietary rights; counterparty risks; economic, financial and political conditions and policies; foreign exchange and tax rates; potential changes associated with geographic expansion; capital market risk; the possibility of expected benefits related to the recently announced transaction may not materialize as expected and the transactions not being timely completed, if completed at all. These important factors and other factors that potentially could affect the company's financial results are described in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period and the company's other SEC filings. The company may change its intentions, beliefs or expectations made at any time and without notice based upon any changes in such factors in the company's assumptions or otherwise.","The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation and while we believe them to be true, may ultimately prove to be incorrect. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, August 1, 2013, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.","I'd like to note that certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; expenses related to stock-based compensation; expenses related to restructuring; the amortization of intangibles and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill; and the associated tax benefit. Please refer to our earnings release which is posted at www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation.","There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a 12-quarter financial overview, highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results on a one-page summary sheet. Further, you can find the PowerPoint overview of the recently announced transaction on our website.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and thank you, all, for joining us today. As you know, on July 25, we announced that we reached an agreement with Vivendi that will, upon closing of the transaction, make us an independent company again. We believe that the transactions described last Thursday represent a tremendous opportunity for our company and all of our shareholders.","Activision Blizzard will acquire approximately 429 million shares and certain tax attributes from Vivendi, in exchange for $5.8 billion in cash, or approximately $13.60 per share, before taking into account any benefit to the company from this tax attributes.","Separately, in a related transaction, an investor group led by Brian Kelly and me will acquire approximately 172 million shares from Vivendi for $2.3 billion in cash. Brian and I are personally investigating a combined $100 million of our own money to purchase company shares from Vivendi through the investor group.","Following completion of the transaction, the majority of shares will be held by public shareholders. The shares purchased by the company will no longer be outstanding, which will deliver meaningful accretion for our shareholders. We expect to emerge from these transactions even stronger than we are today, an independent company, with a best-in-class franchise portfolio and the focus and flexibility to drive long-term shareholder value and expand our leadership position as one of the world's most important entertainment companies. Later in the call, Dennis will provide more detail about the transaction and its expected benefits to Activision Blizzard shareholders.","Turning now to our second quarter results. We're, of course, pleased to announce that Activision Blizzard delivered another quarter and first half of strong financial results. For the first 6 months of the year, Activision Blizzard was the #1 video game publisher in North America and Europe, combined, including toys and accessories. Skylanders was the #1 video game title in North America and Europe, including toys and accessories, and Call of Duty: Black Ops II was the #2 video game title in North America and Europe, combined. Additionally, Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft remains the largest subscription-based MMORPG in the world, ending the quarter with approximately 7.7 million subscribers.","Our remarkably talented and dedicated employees drove our success this quarter as they have in each of the other quarters. They continue to develop and build the great franchises that attract our highly engaged communities and deliver great entertainment to our audiences around the world.","While we had a solid first half, we do expect the remainder of the year to have its challenges for many of the reasons we've highlighted previously and a few I'll share with you now. As excited as we are about our holiday launches, we face a more crowded competitive landscape than we have in the past. We face titles that compete more directly with our offerings and past offerings, including highly anticipated, heavily marketed games launching around our launch dates. To address the effects of this competition, we'll likely further increase our sales and marketing investments this year.","","Also, while the transition to new consoles should bring great long-term opportunities, it creates risks in the short term. Both Sony and Microsoft are planning to release very advanced new game systems, but launch dates, promotional plans and launch quantities remain uncertain. Furthermore, console transitions can create purchase hesitation and otherwise affect consumer spending.","Our concern about competition, macroeconomic effects and the console transition period heading into the back half of the year will not change the basic strategy that has served us very well in the past, to continue to prudently invest in our established franchises and selectively invest in new opportunities like Skylanders or Destiny that have the potential to become established franchises, while always managing our costs very carefully.","Regardless of near-term risks, our focused and disciplined approach has served as well for over 20 years and we expect it to continue to deliver superior shareholder returns over the long term. We're optimistic that our leadership position, scale, infrastructure and talent will allow us to take advantage of the positive long-term fundamentals of our industry.","Looking ahead over that longer-term time horizon, we see many exciting opportunities, including new platforms, new geographies and new business models. We're continuing to invest against these opportunities. And while near-term there are challenges, particularly those related to the console transition that are real, they are not unique. We face similar challenges many times in the past. Our product pipeline and go-to-market plans, both for the remainder of the year and for the future, are strong; our strategy is sound; and our talent is unmatched. All of which gives us confidence in our future now as an independent company with a very heavily invested management team.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Durkin, who will review the transaction and our Q2 financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Dennis?","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will start with a brief recap of the Vivendi transaction we announced last week, followed by a review of our June quarter results and our outlook both pre- and post-transaction for Q3 and for the remainder of the year.","The transaction, which was unanimously approved by the special community of the Board of Directors for Activision Blizzard, as well as our overall board, is expected to close by the end of September 2013, subject to customary closing conditions. Following the closing of the transaction, Activision Blizzard will no longer have a controlling shareholder, as approximately 63% of our outstanding shares will be owned by public shareholders, 24.9% will be held by an investor group led by Bobby and Brian and 12% will be held by Vivendi.","As part of the transaction, Activision Blizzard will buy back approximately 429 million shares or approximately 38% of our outstanding shares for $13.60 per share or a 10% discount to our preannounced price or a 24% discount to yesterday's closing price.","Activision Blizzard will fund the deal, including estimated transaction fees and upfront interest, with approximately $1.2 billion of balance sheet cash and $4.75 billion of newly issued debt. In addition, we also expect to establish a $250 million revolving credit facility, which will be undrawn at closing. We've already received committed financing for the transaction from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan.","On closing, we expect to pay Vivendi approximately $5.83 billion for their shares, which would leave us with more than $3 billion in cash on hand, most of which is foreign cash and all of which help secure future financial stability. Going forward, we believe that our free cash flow generation will support the debt we are taking on, while also allowing us the flexibility to continue to invest in our business and drive value for our shareholders over time. Following the closing of the transaction, Activision Blizzard will have a new capital structure which reduces our weighted average cost of capital and nearly doubles our return on equity.","Now turning to our better-than-expected Q2 results, which we announced on a preliminary basis last week. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.05 billion, record Q2 operating margins of 41% and EPS of $0.28. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we generated revenues of $608 million and operating margin of 20% and EPS of $0.08.","Our Q2 revenues and earnings were lower than in the prior year, as expected, because we didn't have a comparable to the record-setting launch of Diablo III in May of last year. During the quarter, revenues were driven by Call of Duty, Skylanders and Blizzard's World of Warcraft. Digital channels generated a record 63% of total Q2 non-GAAP revenues, led by World of Warcraft and Call of Duty.","Turning to the specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues. For GAAP in Q2, product costs were 22% and total operating expenses were 37%, both better than our outlook due to the product mix and timing of expenses. For non-GAAP in Q2, product costs were 26% and total operating expenses were 55%, again, favorable to our outlook due to product mix and expense timing.","In terms of cash flow, we generated Q2 operating cash flow of $109 million and free cash flow of $90 million. And for the first 6 months, we generated record operating cash flow of $434 million and record free cash flow of $398 million. During the second quarter, we also paid $216 million to shareholders via the $0.19 per share dividend we distributed in May.","From a balance sheet prospective, as of June 30, we ended the quarter with no debt and $4.6 billion in cash and investments or nearly $4 per fully diluted share. Of that amount, approximately 60% was held outside the U.S.","Now moving to our outlook. We have had a solid first half and a good start to the year. But as we've been saying since last November, we believe that the back of this year will be challenging due to a more crowded competitive slate and continuing uncertainties relating to the console transitions that are still in front of us. While these factors continue to keep us cautious, we are raising our GAAP full year outlook as the vast majority of our GAAP revenues and earnings occurred in the first half of the year and are now behind us. Inversely, for non-GAAP, where the majority of our revenues and earnings are still in front of us in the second half the year, we are maintaining and affirming our full year outlook, given the risks I just mentioned.","Now on to the numbers. First, on a pre-transaction basis. Starting with the third quarter. Our guidance reflects the launch of Activision Publishing's third and fourth the DLC Map Packs for Black Ops II and the September 3rd launch of Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo III for PS3 and Xbox 360.","For the September quarter on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $635 million, product cost of 23%, operating expenses of 68%, a tax rate of 26% and a fully diluted weighted average share count of $1.17 billion (sic) [1.17 billion], which can be used for both GAAP and non-GAAP in Q3 and Q4. Finally, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.03. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $585 million, product costs of 25%, operating expenses of 66%, a tax rate of 27% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.03.","For the December quarter, we expect GAAP net revenues of $1.3 billion and GAAP earnings per share of $0.06. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $2.25 billion and EPS of $0.54.","For the full year on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $4.31 billion, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 48% and a tax rate of 26% for the full year. For 2013, fully diluted weighted average share count is expected to be 1.16 billion for both GAAP and non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.77.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $4.25 billion with product costs of 26%, operating expenses of 44%, a tax rate of 27% and EPS of $0.82. Again, all the numbers I just referenced are on a pre-transaction basis, consistent with how we have reported and forecast in the past.","Now let's look at the numbers in a post-transaction basis, as we expect they will be reported in our financials for the balance of the year. As we said, we expect the transaction to close in late September and today we are also providing a post-transaction outlook as it will be reported with only 1 quarter of accretion. To keep the modeling simple, we've assumed that our new capital structure will be in place at the start of the fourth quarter. Any Q3 impacts are expected to be relatively immaterial to the Q3 outlook I just provided.","For GAAP, we expect Q4 EPS of between $0.01 and $0.04 depending on our final financing costs based on a fully diluted weighted average share count of 743 million shares, which can be used for GAAP and non-GAAP. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.82 based on a fully diluted weighted average share count of 1.05 billion, which can be used again for both GAAP and non-GAAP.","On a non-GAAP basis, we expect Q4 EPS of between $0.76 and $0.79, again, depending upon our final financing costs. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.85 to $0.87. Keep in mind the full year reported EPS is based on full year net income divided by the time weighted average shares outstanding in the year, not the sum of the quarters.","Given the reported numbers, we will only show the lower share count in Q4, as well as the corresponding interest payments in that period. The pro forma full year EPS may give a better sense of our earnings' trends, particularly as you look to future periods.","So let's take a look at the numbers on a pro forma basis, assuming the transaction took effect January 1, 2013. In that case our GAAP EPS outlook would be $0.91 to $0.99 and our non-GAAP EPS outlook would be $1.01 to $1.09, reflecting as much as 29% and 33%% accretion on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. The significant accretion reflects the 38% reduction in shares outstanding at closing, partly offset by approximately 150 million to 225 million in incremental after-tax interest expense associated with the new debt. These accretion trends may be useful in thinking about our 2014 outlook, which we will provide more detail on in future calls.","So in summary, although we had a solid Q2 and first half of the year, we remain cautious about the short term and back half of 2013. Longer term, we are excited about the future for our company and industry and committed to continuing the strategy that have successfully guided us through many difficult market transitions in the past. Notably, focus on doing a few things exceptionally well, managing our costs very carefully and delivering superior long-term value to both our customers and our shareholders. Our new ownership structure should make it easier to stay true to this mission.","With all that said, let me now hand the call over to Eric to discuss our Activision Publishing business.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. I'm pleased to report that in Q2 Activision Publishing delivered another record quarter with record digital revenues and operating income. This follows a record Q1 and record years in operating income in 2011 and 2012. We currently have the industry's #1 and #2 titles year-to-date, including toys and accessories with Skylanders Giants and Call of Duty: Black Ops II. This made Activision Publishing the #1 video game publisher in North America and Europe combined in both Q2 and year-to-date. Such remarkable success would not be possible without the talent and passion of our employees and support of our partners around the world.","Year-to-date, Skylanders was the #1 title in North American and Europe. Since its launch, Giants software and toys units are up significantly over Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure in the prior year. The franchise continues to break new ground and create new revenue streams. In fact during Q2, Skylanders was named the best overall -- license -- Overall Best Licensing Program of the Year in 2013 by the Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association. A remarkable achievement for a franchise that is still less than 2 years old.","Skylanders' continuing success is based on sustained innovation and superior game play. The team has delivered outstanding execution and inspired creativity in all aspects of the game, which have helped the franchise shatter records, generating over $1.5 billion in retail sales through July 31 since launching October 1 -- October 2011.","On October 13, Skylanders SWAP Force will introduce an all new play pattern with dynamics swapability which creates all new play options. SWAP Force will be our deepest and most immersive Skylanders world yet. Both the characters and the game looked great at E3. The press had been incredibly positive and retailers have committed over 25% more space than last year.","While this genre we've created will face more direct competition than ever before, every indicator tells us that Skylanders' franchise is solidly on the rise and has both the culture momentum and the product innovation to keep it that way.","Now let's turn to Call of Duty, which is one the world's largest entertainment franchises and which grew strongly in Q2 and in the first half of this year. During the quarter, the scale of our online community and online play both set records. The level of engagement drives digital sales, which in turn drives more engagement in a virtuous cycle.","In Q2, Call of Duty digital sales records, which grew over 100% year-on-year. And at retail, Black Ops II sales exceeded Modern Warfare 3 sales in the prior year. And later this year we expect to launch Call of Duty: Ghosts on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC and Wii U. Call of Duty: Ghosts is a new sub-brand developed by Infinity Ward, the studio that created the original Call of Duty and the seminal Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series and features an all new world, story, characters and experiences all powered by a new next-gen engine.","As one might expect in this console transition year, pre-orders for Call of Duty: Ghosts are well below the record-setting pace set by Call of Duty: Black Ops II last year. However, our quantitative consumer research indicates that hesitation amongst past club preorders is primarily due to not knowing which platform they will be playing on, which is natural at this time in the console transition.","It's worth mentioning that Ghosts preorders are over double those of Call of Duty: Black Ops, which is the last time we launched a new sub-brand for the franchise. It's also worth mentioning that our other key engagement metrics from the number of people playing per month to the number of people playing daily to DLC sales, to video views, to community engagement are all significantly ahead of past years. We also have in place the most aggressive marketing retail and digital programs in the history of the franchise. We've made substantial investments to make Ghosts a showcase for the next-gen consoles and also the best current-gen Call of Duty title ever.","Looking to 2014 and beyond, in addition to our portfolio of annualized titles, as you know, we are developing Call of Duty Online with Tencent for the massive Chinese online gaming audience, although we have nothing new to announce today. And as many of you saw at E3, we have been working with Bungie on Destiny, the breakthrough game the brings first-person action gamers together in a shared persistent online world. The game is on track for a 2014 launch. The research of E3 was nothing short of inspiring, with Destiny receiving over 50 awards, including 20 Best of Show Accolades. We strongly believe that we are on pace to set the all-time preorder records for a new IP. Based on what we've seen, we believe Destiny has the potential to become the third active billion-dollar franchise in the Activision Publishing portfolio.","While we're excited about our fall pipeline and feel good about our go-to-market plans, the rest of this year will be competitive. We expect more direct competition for Skylanders and Ghosts for launching to an even more crowded holiday slate than previously expected. In addition to the uncertainties brought about by new consoles, the new consoles themselves will be competing for our fans' time, attention and dollars.","So in summary, our record results in Q2 affirm our focused strategy in delivering the best AAA titles in the industry, which drive year-round engagement and monetization. This strategy built Call of Duty and Skylanders and is the cornerstone of our pipeline of new intellectual properties. It has served us well in the past and we expect it to help us expand our leadership in the future.","And now, I'll turn it over to Mike Morhaime.","Michael Morhaime","Thanks, Eric. Q2 was a relatively quiet quarter when compared against last quarter which included the StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm launch and Q2 2012 when we launched Diablo III. We've been making great progress on Diablo III console and Hearthstone along with other ongoing projects, which I'll discuss shortly.","Starting off with World of Warcraft, we ended the quarter with about 7.7 million subscribers worldwide, with the declines split about evenly between East and West. The most recent content update in late May has had a positive impact on stabilizing the churn rate in both regions.","Our next major content update, Siege of Orgrimmar, is currently in the public testing phase. This update includes a massive new raid dungeon and new questing area, as well as some new features. Proving grounds is a way for players to learn the skills they need for in-game contents and flexible raids allows groups of varying sizes to enjoy in-game rating. This will make it easier for players to experience compelling in-game contents with their friends. In addition to sustaining engagement for existing players, we believe these features can help make the transition back to the game more compelling for returning players as well. We look forward to releasing this update in the coming weeks.","Before I get into the other game updates, I want to say a few words about our unannounced project, codename Titan. We're in the process of selecting a new direction for the project and re-envisioning what we want the game to be. And while we can't talk about the details yet, it is unlikely to be a subscription-based MMORPG. I also want to reiterate that there has not been an official announced or projected release date. What I can say is that the commitment's quality has always been at the core of Blizzard values. And we've gone through this type of iterative development process several times in the past on the way to creating genre-defining games. As we continue our assessment, we have shifted some of the resources from the team to our other franchises, including World of Warcraft and Blizzard All-Stars, which we believe will add immense value to those projects.","On the Diablo III side, we announced a September 3 date for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions to the game. Our showing at E3 was a great opportunity to reinsure ourselves to the console gaming audience. The development team has done a lot of work to tailor Diablo III for a living room experience and these subtle changes have been very well-received by the press. We'll be sharing more Diablo-related news at Gamescom later this month.","Moving on to StarCraft II. We just launched Heart of the Swarm in China a couple of weeks ago and in these early stages have seen a jump in concurrency in the region. In addition, our year-long StarCraft II World Championship Series is currently in its second season with the season finals taking place later this month at Gamescom in Germany.","We've also been putting a lot of focus on Blizzard All-Stars, our upcoming free-to-play online game. Action RTS games have become increasingly popular over the years. As we have in the past with games like World of Warcraft and the original Diablo, we're looking to put our own spin on this genre and challenge some of the existing design paradigms. We've reached a significant internal milestone with Blizzard All-Stars going into wider internal testing and we'll have more to say about the game later this year.","Rounding out our announced game projects is Hearthstone, our new free-to-play digital collectible card game. Hearthstone will launch initially on Windows and Mac PC followed by iPad soon after. We've made great progress polishing the game through internal testing and will be reaching the external test phase very soon. Our promotions in the last quarter, which included several live streamed game-play demos have generated great budge for the game since we revealed it at PAX East in March. Not only will this be our first game on iPad, it will also be the first time in a very long time that we have announced a game and launched it within the same year. This reflects the philosophy behind a small team of Blizzard veterans developing Hearthstone to create Blizzard-quality games on a smaller scale.","Looking ahead, we have BlizzCon coming up on November 8 and 9 at the Anaheim Convention Center. The show will be a good one with the latest Blizzard news, hands on with games and development and of course, the global finals for our StarCraft II World Championship Series. We hope to see you there or following along via the online stream or on a DirecTV.","As we enter the back half of 2013, what we're showing at Blizzard is a broadening of our gaming portfolio. Just 3 years ago, we had 1 active game. Moving into the rest of 2013 and beyond, we will have several active and vibrant games across 3 major franchises on multiple platforms and with different business models. We'll continue to work hard on creating epic game experiences for our players and look forward to delivering those experiences in a variety of ways.","Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","With respect to holiday competition, can you give us your latest thought on marketing efforts for the holidays? Will there be a new strategy here? Should we expect marketing dollars to be up or down? Or you just going to spend smarter dollars rather than more dollars? And with respect to the wild sub declines, I think last quarter was more Asia based, now it seems to be ramping up more on the West. Can you just give us a little more color there on the split?","Eric Hirshberg","I'll take the marketing portion of the question, this is Eric. As Bobby mentioned I believe in his comments, we expect that marketing cost might well be up year-over-year. That said, we do have extremely strong plans already in place. And I think we've shown best-in-class marketing efforts in our ability to make our launches into real cultural events and make them unignorable. And that's what we plan on doing this year.","Michael Morhaime","[indiscernible] on the wild sub decline, in aggregate in Q2, we did see a smaller decline than we saw in Q1. And I think it's very important to note the impact that our content updates have had since the most recent update, mid-May. We have seen a very positive impact on the churn rate. And that's across both regions.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. And just one more follow-up on WoW. There's kind of been rumors in and out of the press on a potential movie set with the WoW theme. Any updates there?","Michael Morhaime","I don't have any updates other than to say that we are continuing to work with Legendary Pictures. Duncan Jones has been selected as the writer\/director, who has been actively working on the movie. And we continue to be very excited about it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird & Co.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just have a question and one follow-up. I guess first, Mike, in the scenario that WoW were to continue declining, I'm wondering whether your priority, ultimately, would be to protect profitability of the franchise or to continue spending on potential growth initiatives? And then on the strategic priorities following the buyback, Bobby, you mentioned before perhaps acquisitions as one opportunity. I wondered if you care to provide any profile of what you might be looking for and maybe rank some of the strategic options as well.","Michael Morhaime","So on the World of Warcraft side, our priority is to continue delivering great content to our players. We feel the WoW continues to be the top most compelling, actually, multiplayer online role-playing game available. And we think it still has a very long life ahead of itself. We think that, over time, we have seen players come and go and return to World of Warcraft. And we recognize that there's a lot that we can do to make the experience of coming back to World of Warcraft and the transition back into the game and meeting up with your friends much easier than it currently is. And so I think that's a big opportunity for us.","Robert A. Kotick","And no, I can't comment on future acquisition plans.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Actually just to kind of following up on the last one. I want to give another shot. On the margin side for Blizzard, you've seen, obviously, a lot of fluctuation depending on the mix of product and you had the best margins last year, close to 60%. And this quarter, because of the mix, have been closer to the high 20s. Where do you feel comfortable -- I think, historically, it's been in the high 30s, low 40s. Again, sort of the balance between growth and profitability. Can you give us some ballpark of how you guys are thinking about margins?","Michael Morhaime","So I'll just answer that from my perspective. Dennis can jump in if he wants. I think that the margins are very much influenced by our release schedule. And so, of course, World of Warcraft has much more stable margins but when we release something like Diablo III, that's going to have a huge impact to the margins in that quarter.","Dennis Durkin","Yes, I think in the past you've seen that it is very release dependent. Like all of our businesses, content ends up being a stimulus for the installed base. But we're going to continue to invest to drive growth within the community and making sure we're kind of balancing the customer experience and the player experience with our profitability goals. And we think we can do those 2 things hand-in-hand.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So one for Dennis. I just wanted to get your thoughts on securing interest rates on your debt below the 5% to 7% range you suggested last week. And then for Eric, maybe you can talk how your outlook has changed on Skylanders for the holidays amid some of the movement around timing for the Disney product?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. This is Dennis. Just with regards to your first question on sort of financing costs. I think that range is the appropriate one based on how you should think about what the potential could be. We're obviously going to do our best to maximize and optimize towards the low end of that range and try and build as much flexibility to our financing package as we can. And we're moving as quickly as we can to try and market the deal and get the deal completed. Obviously, we're in an interest rate environment that has some volatility in it, although it's stabilized over the last 60 days. So we'll be watching that closely and moving as quickly as we can. But that's essentially the range that we're expecting to end up in.","Eric Hirshberg","On Skylanders. Frankly, our outlook hasn't changed. The competition launching closer to our window is neither here nor there for us. We're focused on delivering what we think will be the best Skylanders game we've delivered yet with another breakthrough play mechanic, with swapability, and the strongest marketing and retail support yet. Just when we thought we couldn't get any bigger after last year's retail presence, we've increased it by 25% again this year. So for all those reasons, our financial outlook hasn't changed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Williams from BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Eric, just -- I want to go to Call of Duty Online for a moment. What are the steps that we should be looking for next before that product actually gets a commercial release? And then as we kind of think about it, I guess the key thing for me is trying to get a sense as to the size of what that could be and when the contribution can really kick in?","Eric Hirshberg","In terms of the next steps, we are still solidly in the development process and focusing on creating a great game. And we're taking the time as necessary to make sure that we deliver that. As for the next steps, Tencent is a great partner. They are the ones who will really be leading the path to commercialization, through governmental approvals, through the beta, through that sort of thing. So we're going to rely upon them to guide us through that process. Our priority is getting the quality right. And we feel that the production is going well.","Robert A. Kotick","I would add that, I think, Tencent's investment in the company was a recognition of the enthusiasm that they have for the opportunity.","Operator","We'll hear next from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","Question for Bobby and Mike. In the 5 years since you guys joined forces in the sort of the Vivendi transaction the first time around, there was a lot of hope and anticipation for synergies between the 2 companies. I wondered if you could comment on the things that you have accomplished over those 5 years together that you couldn't have done separately? And then your comment on what you think you might be able to do in the next 5 years in working together now that you're an independent company without Vivendi? And then, Bobby, on the console transition. As we move past the uncertainty and the timing and the launch quantities, what is your perspective longer term about the size of this coming cycle with so many different other options out there in gaming? Do you think this cycle could be bigger, smaller, the same size as the cycle that we're finishing now?","Robert A. Kotick","Good questions. So we'll start with my perspective of the synergies. I think -- remember that part of the original thinking behind the merger was that there were categories of business that Blizzard operated in that Activision didn't. And so rather than us spending $1.5 billion like other competitors have investing in MMOs, as an example, without any success and we view the merger would give us the opportunity to get insight and understanding about areas like Battle.net. And the impact of things like the insights we developed from Battle.net are really profound on Call of Duty. But we largely wanted to keep the culture of the company, the operations of the business independent. The things that were easy and obvious were corporate functions, worldwide retail execution, which has been in the benefit of having a single-focused worldwide retail distribution organization has been hugely helpful. There were process improvements that we made across the company that got implemented both within Activision Publishing and in Blizzard. There's been talent moving between the businesses. I think one of the great benefits and insights that we developed as a combined company was the opportunity in China. When we started out, Blizzard was successful in China, but probably one of the most successful Western entertainment companies in China. And I think that, to put that in perspective, I'm not just saying game company. I think when you look at the success that Blizzard just had in China, it's probably the most successful Western entertainment company in China. And that insight has been hugely helpful in shaping the combined company thinking about how to address China. Obviously, then, on things like purchasing, scale and leverage on servers and data centers and negotiating all the things that relate to the back-end products like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. And I think you'll continue to see -- the first few years were really focused on just continuing to operate and execute, the next few years we had the benefit of really starting to understand synergies. And I think the next 5 years, you're going to see a lot of the benefits of the combination. In this year, in particular, we'll launch for the first time of a Blizzard console game as an example. But I think when you think about the relationships that we have with first parties, it certainly benefited Blizzard. And that we've probably spent the conference call talking about all of the benefits that we've seen in the way that we did manage our talent development process and evaluate performance in establishing metrics for evaluating performance and rewarding performance. But I think you'll see the next 5 years a lot of the benefits of the synergies that we've really explored over the last year.","Michael Morhaime","So just a couple of points that Bobby may not have mentioned. I think that when we first did the merger, I think we all recognize that there were certain complementary areas of expertise that Blizzard had and that Activision had. And I think that there is definitely an ongoing benefit even if we're not contributing directly on each other's products, there's some really good knowledge sharing that's happening between the 2 companies, the 2 divisions, in sort of giving each other advice and sharing the lessons that we've learned in various aspects of game-making. And so I think that, that's helping us on the console side of the business. And I think that there are things that as we move into different business models, Activision and Blizzard both have complementary experience dealing with different types of games that potentially could be applied or at least help us navigate new space.","Robert A. Kotick","But at the end of the day, they are separate business operations with separate management, separate strategies, separate business plans. And we view that as a big benefit. One thing to point out is when we did the original merger, it was with Vivendi Games. And there was whole Vivendi Game operation independent of Blizzard that needed to be dismantled, projects that needed to be terminated, canceled or sold. And so there was a fair amount of synergy getting that just came from eliminating unproductive investments that have been made in the Vivendi game side of the business.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","Got it. Then, the new cycle?","Robert A. Kotick","What was the second question?","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","The new cycle, your thoughts on the scale of the coming cycle, whether it could be bigger, smaller, same size?","Robert A. Kotick","I mean, if you look back in history, what you've seen is that every new cycle has been larger than the prior cycle. I don't know that we've had the same number of competing platforms or opportunities to deliver interactive entertainment. But I will say this, I think, that most manufacturers are delivering on the promise of excellent hardware. We have much more visibility today than we even did 3 months ago. And I think they both made great progress. I think they're going to put more marketing money against the launches than ever before. I think they have both learned a lot about how to improve and enhance supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies. I think when you look at all of these new benefits that will come from direct digital distribution, the ability to have an always-on device, I think there's a lot that you look at in terms of future and capabilities, whether it's social gaming, whether it's some of the enhancements, improvements you see in graphics processing or the efficiencies, in Sony's case, in reducing all of these parallel processing devices to much more clean architecture. But my sense is that I think consumers are going to be excited about this hardware. And I think that, over the long term, they probably be, if not as long as what we've seen in the current cycle, roughly the same amount of time. And I think that you're going to see new kinds of software that has not been available in this current generation. I'm just seeing the things that we're working on and the things that we're developing, things that we've never been able to do before, that I think will excite audiences in ways that we haven't seen before.","Operator","And our final question will come from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","One for Dennis. Could you just confirm, the share count you're giving for the back half of the year seemed a little higher than what I expected. Is that just due to some additional dilution created by the rising of stock price? And then for Eric. You said that the fall window is going to be even more competitive than you had -- sort of were projecting. What's changed in the last 3 months to sort of alter your view on that?","Dennis Durkin","Yes, thanks, Doug. I'll handle the first one and hand it over to Eric. Yes, since our guidance, with the stock price move, we have more diluted shares, as well as, as you go through the year, we're granting more shares to employees. So you just want to make sure you're comparing the right periods in there. When you look on the slide in our deck here that has sort of the different pre-transaction, post-transaction, the Q4 number is really probably the closest because that's the weighted average for that Q4 post-transaction number, the 743 million number. That's probably the best number to use when you start thinking about next year as a fully diluted number. And it is as the results of the increased share price and all the other things that have happened during the course of the year.","Eric Hirshberg","As far as the competition in Q4, the relative statement was versus last year. And also there have been some key competitors that have moved into the fall quarter -- of the Q4, closer to our launch, that's what I was referring to.","Operator","And I'd like to turn the conference back over to Kristin Southey for any additional or closing remarks.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thank you. On behalf of everyone at Activision Blizzard, we want to thank you for your time and consideration. And we look forward to speaking to you in the future. Thank you.","Operator","Again, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you, all, for your participation."],"494":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Amrita Ahuja, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Amrita Ahuja - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. With us are Bobby Kotick, CEO; Thomas Tippl, COO; Dennis Durkin, CFO. And for Q&A, Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King will also join us.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation, and while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.

The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, February 9, 2017.","We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during the call. However, as discussed on our July 29 conference call, due to updated compliance and disclosure interpretations issued by the SEC staff on May 2016, we are no longer able to present non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of (1:46). On this call and in the future, we will continue to provide non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of, intangible assets, expenses including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, expenses related to debt financings and refinancings, restructuring charges and the associated tax benefits. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision.","Please refer to our earnings release which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures. There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access through webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us today. Our performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We achieved record results in 2016, delivering all-time high revenues of $6.6 billion, and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, up 42% and 68% respectively over last year. We also delivered record non-GAAP operating margins of 35%. We over-performed our plan for the quarter delivering record revenues of $2 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, up 49%, and 160% respectively over last year. We also delivered our strongest annual operating cash flow in history at $2.2 billion, up 71% over last year.","Our success continues to be driven by our two greatest assets: our incredibly talented people, and the devoted community of gamers we serve. We have roughly 450 million players in 196 countries, and they spent over 40 billion hours playing our games in 2016, and they watched a record 3 billion hours as spectators of our games. We continued to see opportunities to expand audiences, deepen engagement and increased player investment. In fact, prioritization of opportunity remains our greatest challenge. But we remain vigilant in ensuring that the right resources are connected with the right priorities.","We had number of important successes in 2016 that we'd like to acknowledge. Blizzard's new franchise, Overwatch, has captured the imaginations of players all over the world, and we've only scratched the surface. The truly extraordinary Overwatch team launched the most successful new intellectual property in our company's history. We now have over 25 million registered players and engagement has continued to grow. The King team was very focused on continuously releasing fresh content with new levels and features as well as increasing live operations efforts with events and competitions. As a result, mobile bookings for the Candy Crush franchise grew in 2016.","King also made meaningful progress with its advertising initiatives. Last year's advertising tests had two primary goals: to design and build an outstanding ad platform that would actually enhance our users' in-game experience, and to deliver significant value to advertisers. We're encouraged with the early results. In most tests, our users play more game rounds, spend more time in the game, and have a self reported better game experience with advertising. Additionally, our platform delivers meaningful value to advertisers. We've partnered with some of the world's top advertisers, including Nestle, Fox Entertainment and Visa, and our viewability, verifiability and completion metrics are all encouraging.","Ads are perceived as more unique and interesting when shown on King inventory, and viewers are more likely to take action after seeing an ad in King games. The King team will continue to build on their efforts this year, and we believe advertising has the potential to be a growth driver in the years to come. We also nurtured emerging growth opportunities outside of our games, including e-sports, television and film, and consumer products, and we enhanced the organizations that will support these initiatives. These new opportunities are consistent with and organic to our company's missions, and they have the potential to become important standalone businesses in pursuit of our goal to become the leading 21st century entertainment company.","We accelerated our e-sports efforts with the integration of Major League Gaming, the formation of the Call of Duty World League, and the announcement of the Overwatch League. Our ambition is to create nothing less than the e-sports equivalent of the world's established major professional leagues. To this end, in 2017, we plan to start the process of selling teams and commercializing media rights for the Overwatch League. We look forward to welcoming team owners with the expertise, skills and investment required to build the professional league together.","We plan to invest in these long-term growth pillars further in 2017 and expect them to have even greater impact in 2018 and beyond. I couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future, and our team's dedication and enthusiasm reinforces my confidence that we will continue to achieve our ambitious plans.","Thomas and Dennis will now share with you the results of our record quarter and our record year.","Thomas Tippl - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you, Bobby. Due to our portfolio strength and digital momentum, we far exceeded our plans in 2016. We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectations for the holiday quarter. In driving our record-setting year, and as we look ahead, we remain focused on our three strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.","Let's start with audience reach, which was 447 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had record Q4 MAUs of 41 million. And for the year, Blizzard had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 37% from 2015, and up 87% since 2014. This is a remarkable achievement, demonstrating the strength of the Blizzard portfolio and capabilities. Overwatch, released in May, set the record for the strongest launch year financial performance of any game in Blizzard's 26-year history. The game is critically acclaimed, receiving 55 game of the year awards and reached 25 million registered players faster than any franchise in Blizzard history, beating Diablo III's launch year unit sales record set in 2012, which for a new IP is an extraordinary accomplishment.","In Q4, MAUs rose to a new franchise high, as existing players stayed engaged and new players joined the fun. Showcasing its continued global appeal, Overwatch has players all over the world, including great success in Korea and China. It's always difficult for Western companies to succeed there, and Overwatch's popularity is testament to Blizzard's unique ability to create globally appealing games.","World of Warcraft's Legion expansion, which launched in late August, continues to reenergize the community. For the year, MAUs were up 10%, and for the quarter, MAUs were up over 20% versus year ago.","Hearthstone players enjoyed a tremendous amount of new content in 2016, with one adventure and two expansions including Mean Streets of Gadgetzan in the fourth quarter. For the year, Hearthstone had record MAUs, up over 20% year-over-year, and for the quarter, MAUs were also up versus year ago.","Activision had Q4 MAUs of 51 million. On a full-year basis, Activision had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 3% from 2015, and up 23% since 2014. Black Ops III's digital season led to record MAUs for Call of Duty in the year, and Destiny showed steady engagement in its third year. Call of Duty was the number one franchise in North America for the eighth year in a row, and the number one console franchise globally, a mantle we've held for seven of the last eight years.","Activision's November release, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a high quality, innovative game that paired with Modern Warfare Remastered offers a tremendous amount of value and gameplay variety. However, sales underperformed our expectations, and it's clear that for a portion of our audience, the space setting just didn't resonate. We had a passionate experienced studio deeply committed to this direction, and despite the risks we saw, we believe it is important to consider the passions of our game teams in deciding what content to create. While it wasn't the success we planned, it allows us to protect a core tenets of our culture that Bobby discussed, empowering our talented teams to have the chance to pursue opportunities that they are passionate about.","Providing an environment that recognizes passion is a critical component of our success, and the process to learn from our mistakes is what makes our company special, and it's why the most talented people in our industry are attracted to our company. In 2017, Activision will take Call of Duty back to its roots, and traditional combat will once again take center stage. This is what our dedicated community of Call of Duty players and Sledgehammer Games, who has been developing this year's title, are the most excited about. The Call of Duty community remains strong, and Call of Duty is the most successful video game franchise of the last 20 years. Overall franchise MAUs were stable in Q4 as players engaged on multiple titles. Life to date, on current gen consoles, Call of Duty alone has three of the top ten games. This demonstrates the value of year round engagement and live operations on both new releases and our highly engaging prior releases.","Activision also released Skylanders Imaginators during the fourth quarter, an innovative new game that allows players to create and play their very own Skylanders. The game has delighted kids around the world, and has grown the franchise to become the 11th biggest console franchise of all time with more than 300 million toys sold. Based on this franchise strength, our film and TV division launched its first initiative, Skylanders Academy on Netflix in October, which has been very well received. The second season will be delivered later this year, and Netflix has already ordered a third season. In 2017, rather than releasing a new console title, we will be supporting the award-winning Skylanders Imaginators with multiple adventure packs, new characters and new in-game content. We are also excited to bring Skylanders Imaginators to Nintendo Switch as a launch title next month, and we have a new Skylanders mobile game in development.","Now turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Our compelling games, deep gameplay and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also strong engagement with over 10 billion hours of playtime in Q4. Our 43 billion hours of engagement in 2016 was on par with Netflix and 1.5 times Snapchat. And importantly, we own our content.","Blizzard's Q4 playtime sets a new record, breaking the previous record set in Q3. During the fourth quarter, Overwatch had its second and third seasonal events, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland, showcasing the successful year round event-based approach to content. Each successive event drove new engagement records, including the most recent Lunar New Year event. And Overwatch has more exciting content coming.","Blizzard's increased investment in World of Warcraft development resources is paying off through a more regular content cadence for players, with two patches released since Legion launched. This has resulted in higher engagement for the franchise, with an increase in total playtime for the quarter surpassing Legion's launch quarter, and all non-launch quarters in the last four years. More content is coming later this year, as the full Legion story unfolds.","King's player base continues to be highly engaged with time spent of 34 minutes per daily active user, an increase over last year, and last quarter. This was due in part to our increased focus on live operation efforts. King also released a new franchise sequel at the start of this year, Bubble Witch Saga 3, which is off to a great start. Playing our games is just one way our players engage with our franchises. We recently announced our new Consumer Products division, headed by Tim Kilpin, a veteran of Mattel and Disney. Elevating our nascent consumer products business to a more strategic level is a great opportunity to provide our communities with more high-quality products and collectibles based on our own intellectual properties. Our audiences also connect with our franchises by viewing our games. In fact, Activision Blizzard accounted for five of the top ten most viewed games on Twitch in 2016.","E-sports has become not only a catalyst for increased reach and engagement, but also a stand-alone opportunity. Our Major League Gaming division hit a number of milestones this year, including hosting tournaments for Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft, launching the enhanced viewing experience, integrating the MLG.tv player into Call of Duty, growing video viewers on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram by 50%, and increasing twice player engagement by over 60% year-over-year. Activision's launch of the Call of Duty World League sparked strong growth for Call of Duty e-sports. Activision doubled the 2016 prize pool to over $3.5 million across 16 hosted events. Millions of fans were drawn to the action with the 2016 season delivering 120 million video views, and more than twice the time spent viewing compared to last year's season. We look forward to plenty more action in the months to come.","Last year, Blizzard held its tenth BlizzCon and celebrated its 25th anniversary. BlizzCon again sold out in minutes and drew a large global audience with over 25,000 in-person attendees, and 10 million people from around the world tuning in. Blizzard also sold a record number of DIRECTV pay-per-view tickets to fans wanting the full BlizzCon virtual experience.","Blizzard announced the formation of the Overwatch League at BlizzCon. For fans, it will offer city-based teams around the world competing in annual seasons, with standardized schedules creating a consistent experience to build passion and allegiance. For team owners, guaranteed slots and clear rights will enable stability and transparency that they can invest in. For players, contracts, including benefits and a combine for player selection will open up the sort of career opportunities associated with traditional sports.","The Overwatch League is being designed to bring a new era to e-sports with an epic entertainment experience for everyone involved. Blizzard feels it has the community passion in place and the required structure established to commence the process of selling teams and media rights for the Overwatch League later this year. We'll have more exciting news to share in the months ahead. In January, Blizzard kicked off its Heroes Global Championship and announced its upcoming third annual collegiate e-sports competition, Heroes of the Dorm, which will be streamed exclusively via Facebook Live, ensuring broader global accessibility to e-sports audiences.","Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investments. In-game purchases were yet again close to $1 billion in the quarter, and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double last year's $1.7 billion. Even without the benefit of the addition of King to our portfolio, the company's in-game purchases would have grown 33% this year. World of Warcraft content and continued strength in Overwatch seasonal events delivered Blizzard's record levels of in-game revenues in the quarter and for the full year. Activision's record in-game revenues for 2016 were driven by a record-setting Call of Duty Black Ops III in-game content season where for the first time, add-on revenues were greater than DLC and Season Pass combined even with record Season Pass participation.","Over the past several years, Activision has methodically and creatively evolved the Call of Duty business model, and this performance illustrates the impact those strategies have had in a relatively short period of time. It also showcases the virtuous cycle created when engaging content leads to more player investment. And this year is the first time we have three player communities at scale concurrently in Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III, and we will be supporting each of them with new content throughout the year.","Destiny continues to have a large and committed audience, which is eager for new content and adventures. Activision along with their partners at Bungie plan to answer the call with the release of a full Destiny sequel later this year, designed to thrill our existing loyal fan base and bring many new players into the fold. We plan to support the release of the sequel, with a great content plan post launch, setting the stage for growth with this year's sequel and the content season that will follow.","King continues to perform from a player investment perspective despite lower MAUs. Bookings per paying user has increased six quarters in a row to its highest level ever. Importantly, we saw stability in the Candy Crush franchise throughout the year, with fourth quarter and full-year mobile gross bookings increasing year-over-year for the franchise. We have also invested in a mobile incubation pipeline with multiple games for a number of our core franchises across the company. We will rely on our own talented teams and partners, and leverage King's mobile expertise. Some of these games has reached the prototype phase and we believe could drive growth in future years. We'll have more to share on our expanding mobile efforts down the road.","So in summary, despite many opportunities for improvement, 2016 was by far our best year ever from what we've accomplished and for the groundwork we laid to realize the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead. Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail.","Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Thomas. Q4 was another great quarter, capping off a record setting year. For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on three different interactive platforms: console, PC, and mobile. Nearly $1 billion in Asia Pacific revenues and more digital revenues for the year than our prior record for total company revenues, all of which helped contribute to record non-GAAP operating margin of 35%, year-over-year EPS growth of 68%, and nearly $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. These results highlight the powerful combination of owned IP, a direct and increasingly digital customer connection and global scale. We're obviously very encouraged by this and believe we're only in the early innings of realizing this multi-year opportunity.","Looking back, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results unlike our consolidated results are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. Blizzard had its strongest financial performance in history including record revenue up more than 50% versus last year, a record $1 billion in segment operating income for the year, up 81% versus last year, and record Q4 revenue up 46% versus last year. This historic performance underscores the significant progress Blizzard has made towards transforming into a multi-franchise, multi-platform and multi-geography company.","In 2016, Blizzard had more than 60% of its revenues from non-World of Warcraft franchises, 20% of its revenues from non-PC platforms and more than 25% of its revenues in APAC. Activision's Q4 had strong catalog and digital performance from Call of Duty Black Ops III, which offset new release underperformance. Activision delivered record Q4 and full-year in-game revenues and the strong digital performance helped drive a record full-year segment operating margin of 35%. In 2016, King contributed more than the originally planned 30% accretion to our overall results. They continued to have two of the top ten grossing games in the U.S. for the 13th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with an increase in mobile bookings year-over-year.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.","For the quarter, we generated record Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.01 billion, $158 million above our November guidance, and $661 million or 49% above Q4 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $438 million for the quarter. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.33. We generated an all-quarter record non-GAAP EPS of $0.65, $0.25 above guidance. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.27. The over-performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven primarily by Overwatch and World of Warcraft as well as favorable adjustments to our tax rate versus guidance. In Q4, you saw the power of our diverse portfolio and year-round engagement model, where even with lower Call of Duty Frontline sales, we were able to deliver growth and record results.","Turning to the full year, we generated record GAAP revenues of $6.61 billion, up 42% year-over-year, an operating margin of 21% and EPS of $1.28. The impact of deferred revenue was negative $9 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated record EPS of $2.18, up 68% year-over-year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.02 in 2016. The digital transition continues to be a nice tailwind for our business, and digital revenues in Q4 were an all quarter record $1.5 billion, double last year's figure. For the year, we delivered record digital revenues of $4.9 billion, up 94% versus last year. The primary driver for our digital momentum is the continued growth of in-game content. As Thomas mentioned, in-game purchases were close to $1 billion for the quarter, and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double the $1.7 billion we had last year. We believe we still are in the early days of this important vector in our business with more opportunity ahead.","In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance has led to record cash flow generation. For the year, we delivered a record $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $859 million.","From a balance sheet perspective, we had a number of positive developments in 2016. The durability of our underlying business has driven continued credit rating improvement. During the year, S&P upgraded us to investment grade, and Moody's, who had upgraded us in 2015 concurrent with the King deal announcement, moved us up another notch. In August, we restructured our term loans, which allowed us to realize interest rate savings and in September, we issued new five-year and ten-year notes which replaced our prior 2021 notes at a more cost-effective rate. So, a very busy year on the capital structure front.","Regarding liquidity, we finished the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, with almost $1.4 billion held domestically. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow have allowed us to return significant capital to our various stakeholders. Since 2010, we have repurchased $7.8 billion of our shares and paid out over $1.3 billion in dividends. In addition, since 2013, of the $7.1 billion of gross debt we have borrowed to fund the Vivendi buyback and the King transaction, we've already repaid $2.1 billion as of the end of 2016. Continuing on this trend, our board has once again approved a balanced approach to capital allocation for 2017, increasing our dividend by 15% to $0.30 per share payable in May, authorizing debt pay down of $500 million this year, of which we've already paid down $139 million in February, and authorizing a $1 billion stock repurchase over the next two years.","Now, let's turn and look forward to our outlook for 2017. In 2017 as expected, we have a lighter slate of full-game releases. Given fewer major launches this year, we expect to build on our strong momentum on year-round engagement and in-game player investment across our portfolio. A few other things to call out. While strategically important, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch league and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. In addition, as we have said previously, we expect advertising to begin to contribute in 2017 and have a more substantial impact in 2018 and beyond.","In terms of segments, we expect a more evenly-weighted contribution from Activision, Blizzard, and King in 2017 than in 2016. We expect Blizzard to have a lower 2017 performance given a lighter release slate. However, Blizzard has lots of exciting plans for live ops and additional in-game content for every franchise, including Overwatch, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft. For Activision, we expect to have lower performance in the first half of the year, given a smaller Call of Duty digital season compared with the record performance of Black Ops III in the first half of 2016. That said, we do expect a larger back half of the year as we release the Destiny sequel and a new Call of Duty title. We are enthusiastic about this year's Call of Duty release going back to its roots, and as such we are guiding it up in Q4 versus last year's Q4 performance.","In addition, as Thomas mentioned, the Skylanders franchise will not have a full game console release this year, but we will continue to engage the community and drive player investment through new toys and digital content. For King, we expect to be modestly up year-over-year, mainly driven by a full-year contribution from the business, the introduction of advertising, and ongoing live ops across the portfolio.","Turning to the numbers, on a GAAP basis for 2017, we expect revenues of $6 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $300 million, with product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 64%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $156 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.72. Our GAAP numbers include a $0.03 net of taxes GAAP-only restructuring charge, which is related to our continued transition to digital.","For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million. We expect a return to the historical tax rate of 24% as 2016's tax rate was lower due to discrete items and stronger international mix due to Blizzard's over-performance. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.70, including a GAAP deferral of $0.15.","Please note that we expect more of a deferral impact in Q4 2017 than we had in Q4 2016 due to the larger expected launches of Destiny and Call of Duty in the second half of the year, part of which will be deferred into 2018. Also just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals, or $0.15, to our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.70 to get to our full-year 2017 number.","Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.55 billion including GAAP deferrals of negative $500 million, product costs of 21%, and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $43 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 760 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.25. For Q1 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs of 21% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $39 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, including a GAAP deferral of negative $0.33.","So in summary, 2016's strong performance highlights the tremendous opportunity and potential we have in front of us. The combination of leading owned IP, and franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class content creation capabilities, and geographic platform and business model diversity provides an incredibly powerful engine for sustained financial performance. So while in 2017, as expected, we will have a lighter release slate, our strong business platform, combined with promising emerging opportunities like e-sports, advertising, and consumer products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond.","Now, I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, and Riccardo as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my question. So looking at Call of Duty, I'm curious what the plan is for content this year, and whether for the Q4 release you intend to tweak anything based on the reaction to last year's version of the game. Thank you.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Tim. Thanks. It's Eric. So the first thing I'll say is just that I think the most important thing is remember, the Call of Duty ecosystem is strong, and we continue to see very strong MAUs, and that this is the first time we'll have three active games with three different player communities at scale with Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III. And the plan is we're going to be driving engagement for all of those titles with great content throughout the year.","As far as the second part of your question, as I've said many times before, with any longstanding franchise like Call of Duty, there's a balancing act we need to strike between staying true to the things that people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovations to keep the franchise fresh and vital. I would argue, over a period of many years now, we've managed that balance on Call of Duty better than just about any longstanding franchise in any medium.","Last year I don't think we got that balance right. Infinite Warfare had a ton of great gameplay innovations that many of our fans appreciated and loved, but it also had a setting that didn't appeal to all of our fans. The good news is, is that I'm excited to say that in 2017 we think we have this balance in perfect harmony with a game that our teams are incredibly passionate about, with a lot of great innovations, but that also has the traditional combat that we know our fans are going to love.","The game is being made by Sledgehammer, as Thomas mentioned. They're a proven team that's passionate about this title. We green-lit it over two years ago now, and they've been hard at work at it ever since, and we can't wait to unveil it to the world soon. And without discussing too much about what else we've got in the Call of Duty pipeline, I can also tell you that we're confident our fans are going to love those games as well, and we've never be more excited either creatively or commercially about our three-year Call of Duty slate.","Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Eric, and congrats on the quarter.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So for Overwatch, would you be willing to provide any additional detail on plans for content in 2017 and beyond? You made reference to live ops, but any additional detail there? And as far as the Overwatch League, any additional color on what you have in store for that? Thanks.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. First, we're very pleased with the launch of Overwatch and the player response to the content. We've entered 2017 with strong momentum. The game passed the 25-million-player mark last month. And each seasonal event that we run has set a record for engagement.","Our plan is to continue evolving Overwatch with new hero and map content, new game modes, and additional events. We've seen very strong engagement in digital sales from these efforts last year. Looking into the future, we also see opportunities in areas like linear media and consumer product. We think that this will help deepen connections with the franchise and also expose Overwatch to new audiences.","In addition, we want to create new ways for players to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League. Esports is growing, but the ecosystem isn't always easy to navigate for players, viewers, or teams. So with the Overwatch League, we're working very hard to address those challenges. Our focus is on creating stability and participation for teams and owners, and accessibility of the content for fans.","We'll have global city-based teams with a standardized annual schedule, creating professional, high quality content and guaranteed league slots for the teams. This is all built on a game that's easy to understand, with short matches, and great action. The core experience is very fun to watch, and there's already a sizable audience for it around the world. Based on this, we think that we'll see significant new business and engagement opportunities.","We're going to start identifying team owners soon. That's our next step. And we're looking forward to holding our first combine and kicking off the League later this year. So with all of that said, we're very excited about Overwatch's future.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mike.","Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. For King advertising, can you fill in some detail on the testing so far and when we should expect that you get to a full rollout across the games and the player base? Thanks.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Mike. Here's Riccardo.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Sure.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","So, first of all, we have a large user base, but more importantly, it's a very engaged user base. You've heard earlier Thomas saying that we have more than half an hour of gameplay per player per day, and we think this is an attractive opportunity, a very attractive opportunity for advertisers. It's a very engaged user base.","So at the last earnings call I said that we are very careful and protective of the user experience, and so we've been testing and we are testing several ad formats. We've been testing with very high quality consumer brands like Nestle or Fox in our key games. We've been testing in Candy and we've been testing in Candy Crush Soda Saga. And we are testing integrated ad formats, which are integrated in the gameplay and are supportive of the gameplay. And so far, the results have been very positive. They've been positive both for the players, with an increase in gameplay and an increase in ad spend, and they've been positive for advertisers.","So we have seen completion rates, which are above industry benchmarks, and we define completion rates as when the player really starts a video ad and finishes the video ad. And further on, we have engaged third parties through third-party research to analyze the impact on players, and the result was that our ads stand out more when they are presented and shown on our platform, on our games than when they are shown on other platforms. So we are very pleased with the results so far.","So we are continuing on our plan, and the plan for this year is, first of all, to continue to invest in building the technical infrastructure, and to continue building out the team. Secondly, we will continue to test various ad formats, and as we do so, we will also ramp up the inventory. So our expectation for this year is to have a positive contribution to the bottom line, and we expect to scale the impact on the bottom line in 2018.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate all the color on the digital revenue strength. I guess I'd be curious to hear about where you finished on full game download mix for consoles for the year and what are you expecting for 2017? Thanks.","Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Brian. Thanks. It's Dennis. Yeah, digital tailwinds have obviously been a huge and important factor across all of our businesses, and thankfully we have the diversity of being across multiple platforms. So having huge success on mobile, which is almost all digital, on PC which has over time become almost all digital, and then the last real holdout is really on console where full game download mix is still the minority of player purchases.","In general, it varies based on title and region and audience type. So for a game in big and mass market as Call of Duty, you see a slightly lower percentage mix of digital just because it is so mass market. But it's now in the low to mid 20s, and that's up from zero three or four years ago. But in games like Destiny and Overwatch, we see in the mid 30s. And that trend is continuing every year where we see 5-plus percentage points of mix moving every year in terms of overall business mix. So it should be a nice tailwind for us and for others in the industry over the next few years as well. Thanks.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Creutz with Cowen.","Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hey, thanks. I think you got 300,000 Redditers to breathe a huge sigh of relief when you confirmed Destiny 2 for this year. Could you give any indication whether you expect that in Q3 or Q4? And then could you talk about what you and Bungie learned from Destiny 1 that's informing the design process for Destiny 2 and your plans for post-launch content? Thanks.","Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hey, Doug, it's Eric. Yeah, I think the best thing we can say about Destiny is that the development is going great, and it is indeed on track for release this fall. As for the particulars, we've got a big reveal planned. I'm going to let the game do most of the talking, but I'll give you some broad strokes. I think that our team and our great partners at Bungie are doing a very nice job on two fronts. One is if you're one of the millions of players who really invested in Destiny 1 and have put a lot of hours and passion into that game, you're going to love this game, and there's a lot more of what you love here.","For anyone who either hasn't yet tried Destiny or hasn't played it in a while, we think we've made a game with the sequel that's going to have a lot for them to love, too. The cornerstone of that is a great cinematic story. That's been a real focus with a great cast of memorable, relatable characters, coupled with some very nice ways to make the game more accessible to a casual player, without losing anything that our core players love. We've made it more accessible to someone who just wants to have a great more casual first-person action experience.","We're also going to introduce Destiny to a number of new people by going to some international markets that we haven't been in before. So I'm going to leave the rest for the reveal, but we're very excited about the game, and it'll be coming this fall.","Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC","As am I. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Merwin with Barclays.","Christopher Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you. I just have one for Riccardo. If you don't mind just updating us on the game pipeline for King. I think you said in the past that you're mostly focused on developing King IP for the time being, but at some point does it make sense to take one of your established IPs from Blizzard or Activision Publishing and create a mobile version of that game that the King team can develop? Thanks.","Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc","Hi, Chris. Here's Riccardo. So over the past year, we have taken a much more focused approach on what content we develop and release. So this is in line with our goal to continuously raise the bar on innovation. Innovation is a major word for us. It is a major focus point. So talking about the King team, first and foremost we're focusing on the existing King franchises. So we have proven last year that our focus on live games, creating new content in the forms of live ops and new features has paid off, and pays off, and we've seen this in the growth of the Candy Crush franchise year-on-year on mobile. So we are continuing to invest in live games.","Secondly, we are working on sister titles and sequels for our existing successful King franchises. We have launched recently, in mid-January, we have launched Bubble Witch 3, and we are extremely pleased not only with the quality of the game, but also with the response from the players and the acceptance from the players. And we are looking forward to scaling further this game in the year. We are also working on titles with much higher level of innovation for the long-term growth of the franchise, and we believe innovation is key for the long-term success.","We're also working for the future on additional IPs in new genres with franchise potential, and here it's great to be part of the Activision Blizzard family, and we are very excited about the opportunities coming from working together on bringing established Activision Blizzard IP to mobile. And we're currently working on this, and the work is at prototype stage. We're also working with the Activision Blizzard team on marketing existing Activision Blizzard mobile IP on mobile devices, and that's where we can leverage the experience we have made on mobile, and the technique and infrastructure. So in summary, our resources are more focused than ever, on the long-term growth of our business.","Christopher Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we have Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you for taking the question. We saw the announcement of the consumer products division. We've certainly seen other companies like Disney turn large IP libraries into big consumer product businesses. Why now in terms of the consumer product launch? How should we think about that opportunity? And what should we be watching for over the next couple of years as that business rolls out? Thank you.","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Great question, Eric. It's Bobby. I think Disney is a great example. They've figured out probably better than any entertainment company how to turn consumer products into a multi-billion dollar business, but also to increase the touch points for their franchises around the world. And so we've elevated consumer products to a new strategic pillar for the company. We hired Tim Kilpin who is a veteran of both Disney and Mattel, and we think that consumer products can accelerate growth by leveraging our IP and creating new ways for people to connect with our franchises, especially as we're launching our e-sports leagues. If you think about consumer products as they relate to the NFL or the NBA, these are billions of dollars of revenues for the leagues, and we think they'll be great opportunities for league and team merchandise. That'll be important components of what we do in the consumer products business.","Generally, we think creating more consumer touch points in a low capital investment, high-return way, adds tremendous value to the franchises. So we think this is a great opportunity for the company, and we're really looking forward to expanding what we do in consumer products with Tim Kilpin.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks. And this is a follow up question for Mike. I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about the Blizzard pipeline as well, both in terms of full new releases and online expansions. And then any sense for the linearity of release timing would be helpful as well. Thanks.","Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Hi, Colin, thanks for the question. Well, last year was a really epic and important year for us, in addition to celebrating our 25th anniversary, we posted record results and have more people playing Blizzard games than ever before. We're very grateful for the passion and support of our players, and our commitment to delivering awesome content to them has never been stronger. So with that in mind, we've put in a significant effort into being able to support the type of longer-term engagement that Blizzard games have always delivered, but doing so now across more games on more platforms and in more regions. So we've really had to scale up our organizational capabilities to do that.","This year, we'll have compelling new content across all of our franchises, as well as continuing to expand beyond the games with things like comics, animated shorts and more. In addition, we're always thinking about new game ideas, and we have several in the prototype phase, but not able to talk about those right now. As I mentioned before the Overwatch League also represents new business and engagement opportunities for us this year and beyond, and that's going to be a big focus for us as well.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We have time for one more question. We will now hear from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Bobby, question for you. With League of Legends recently signing a $50 million year streaming deal with BAMTech, I'm curious, how do you perceive the value for your e-sports properties?","Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Great question, Eric. I actually think it was a very important milestone for e-sports. It's a large-scale broadcast commitment, and I think it really demonstrates how valuable our content can be as spectator content. I think when we look at what the opportunity is for professionally-produced content, and as Mike pointed out, city-based competition around the world, which there really isn't an analog to, we think that if you look at where advertisers want to spend their capital, where sponsors want to spend their capital, it is very difficult to reach 18 to 35-year-old males today, and this programming is incredibly compelling. People are watching it largely as user generated content today. But we think the professionally produced content will have tremendous value, and we think this is going to be a big area of opportunity, again, to strengthen our franchises, but probably most importantly to really celebrate our players. Because if you think about the player investment that our players make, the time, the commitment, there's a great opportunity for us to showcase and celebrate our professional players, and we think there's going to be larger audiences and large numbers of advertisers willing to support those efforts.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks, Bobby.","Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc.","All right. Thank you everyone for joining us today and we'll look forward to talking to you again in early May.","Operator","And that concludes today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation.

In addition, we will also be posting a 12-quarter financial overview, highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results on a one-page summary sheet.","And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and thank you all for joining us today. 2012 was another great year for Activision Blizzard. We achieved record fourth quarter and annual results. And in 2012, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated approximately $5 billion in revenues, a 34% operating margin and EPS growth of 27% over the prior year. We increased our operating cash flow by 41%.","Our strong cash flow has given us the flexibility to invest in our portfolio and product pipeline, while also returning $3.8 billion to investors since 2009 through dividends and share repurchases. Today, we announced our Board of Directors has increased our annual cash dividend to $0.19 a share.","Our 2012 results are due to the drive, passion and creativity of our employees around the world. Their efforts, aligned with our focused long-term strategy and investment discipline, produced strong creative and financial results for our company.","In the U.S. and Europe, we were the #1 video game publisher at retail, with the #1 title overall, the #1 console title and the #1 PC title. We were also the #1 independent Western Digital game publisher and had the #1 subscription-based MMORPG.","Skylanders, our newest franchise, which is both toys and video games, has  life-to-date sold in excess of $100 million toys and generated revenues of approximately $1 billion. This week, Activision Publishing revealed the third game in the Skylanders franchise for holiday 2013. And while there are new entrants in the category and challenges from slower than expected adoption of the Wii U, we remain enthusiastic about Skylanders' future prospects.","Our success in 2012 was also attributed to the significantly better performance of Blizzard's Diablo III. And while we had a strong 2012, we recognize that 2013 is a transition year, as we enter the ninth year of the current generation of console video game systems. We encounter new threats from unproven business models, and we compete against new category entrants. We aren't immune to unfavorable market dynamics, but we have navigated through the transitions many times before, and we are well prepared to do so again.","Our discipline and focus have served us well and we believe they will continue to do so for the very long term. In 2013, we'll continue to execute against the proven strategy of investment in our established franchises, selectively introducing new concepts like Skylanders, and managing our costs very carefully.","Activision Publishing will continue to invest in Call of Duty and Skylanders, along with Bungie's new universe and Call of Duty online for China, each of which is being developed with quality and innovation that has the potential to redefine their respective categories for the future, and we hope will add value for our shareholders in future years.","Blizzard plans to launch StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm on March 12, which we expect to continue Blizzard's remarkable record of excellence. And there are also in development a new content for World of Warcraft and Diablo III players, and we'll of course continue to invest for the future in Blizzard All-Stars and our all new MMO. We believe that the investments we are making today should enable us to continue diversifying our portfolio while adding new profitable revenue streams into the future.","2013 is going to be a volatile and challenging year. Looking ahead, we believe we're well-positioned to deliver long-term growth and value to our shareholders as we have since 1991.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis, who will take you through our financial results.","Dennis Durkin","Thank you, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will begin with a recap of our better-than-expected Q4 and full year 2012 financial results and then, I'll review our outlook for 2013 and for Q1.","Beginning with our Q4 results, please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also, the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted.","Q4 was a record quarter for the company. Our combination of incredible people, deep global franchises and the largest-ever hardware installed base were all key factors in not only executing against our plan, but exceeding it.","First, let's walk through the Q4 numbers, which were largely driven by the Call of Duty and Skylanders franchises. For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated better-than-expected revenues of $1.8 billion and EPS grew to a fourth quarter record of $0.31. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated better-than-expected revenues of $2.6 billion, digital revenues increased 22%, our operating margin expanded over 750 basis points to 44%, operating income exceeded $1 billion for the first time in a quarter and EPS grew 26% to a record $0.78.","Turning to specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For the quarter, GAAP product costs were 31%, GAAP operating expenses were 42%, below our outlook, due mainly to revenue overperformance. Our GAAP tax rate was 27%.","Non-GAAP product costs were 28% and non-GAAP operating expenses were 27%, again below our outlook due mainly to revenue outperformance. And our non-GAAP tax rate was 23%.","Our solid execution in Q4 anchored what was a record year for Activision Blizzard. For the full year, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $4.9 billion an operating margin of 30% and EPS of $1.01. On a non-GAAP basis for the calendar year, we generated better-than-expected revenues of nearly $5 billion. We expanded our operating margin 380 basis points to 34% and grew EPS 27% to $1.18, both records. We exceeded our initial non-GAAP EPS expectations of $0.94 based on the large scale success of Diablo III and Skylanders.","In terms of cash flow in 2012, we generated over $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of more than $390 million over the prior year. Over the last 4 years, we have generated more than $4.8 billion of operating cash flow. And today, as Bobby mentioned, the Board of Directors approved, once again for the third straight year, an increase to our cash dividend, which now stands at $0.19 per share.","Now moving to 2013. We expect 2013 will be a competitive and challenging year given the macroeconomic conditions and the uncertainty that surrounds console transitions. For those of you who remember, the last transition was disruptive, volatile and financially difficult to predict. Additionally, we had some tough year-over-year comparisons given Blizzard's unprecedented success with Diablo III and our favorable tax benefits in 2012.","That said, our product lineup is expected to be anchored by 4 of our top franchises: Call of Duty, Skylanders, World of Warcraft and StarCraft. It will also be a year of significant continued investment in several new properties with long-term potential that are not factored into our 2013 financial outlook, including Activision Publishing's new Bungie universe, Call of Duty Online for China and the new Blizzard MMO.","Now on to the numbers. For calendar year 2013, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $4.085 billion, product cost of 26% and operating expenses of 48%. We expect a tax rate of 26% for the full year and a diluted share count of 1.15 billion. The share count can be used for all quarters for GAAP and non-GAAP. Finally, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.68.","For 2013, we expect non-GAAP net revenues of $4.175 billion. We expect non-GAAP product costs of 26% and operating expenses of about 43% and a tax rate of 27% resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.80.","So let's take a moment to walk through the non-GAAP EPS variance, versus our performance in 2012. On the product side, starting with Blizzard, we have a very tough comparison due to release slate and product launch timing. Specifically, for the full year 2012, Diablo III contributed more than $0.20 of EPS on a standalone basis. This year, our outlook for Blizzard includes the release of the StarCraft II expansion pack, Heart of the Swarm, in March and one additional title.","Combined, we have modeled these 2 titles being down significantly compared to last year's record-setting combination of Diablo III and Mists of Pandaria. For 2013 on the Activision Publishing side, there is increased volatility this year due to the ongoing console transition, which makes predicting the future more challenging than during normal years in the cycle. For Call of Duty, consistent with our past practices, we are planning for the mainline release in Q4 to be down versus 2012. And also, as I mentioned, our outlook does not include the release of the Bungie game or Call of Duty Online in China, although, we still incur costs throughout the year on these projects. In total, we expect the year-over-year impact of all these items will be more than $0.10.","Lastly, from a non-operating perspective, in 2013, our tax rate is expected to be 27%, which is 21% in 2012 due to the favorable discrete tax benefits that were realized in 2012. In addition, on the foreign exchange side, we have modeled conservatively to protect ourselves against adverse fluctuations in currency that we have seen in the past. The impact of tax and FX on our numbers, year-over-year, is more than $0.10.","Taken together, the lack of a comparable title to Diablo III, a lower forecast for the Call of Duty mainline release, continued investment in new IP like Bungie and higher taxes and FX more than make up the difference in the year-over-year non-GAAP EPS numbers.","Moving to the outlook for the March quarter. Last week, Activision Publishing released Revolution, the first DLC Map Pack for Black Ops II on Xbox. And Blizzard is expected to launch the StarCraft II expansion pack, Heart of the Swarm, in March. On a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.16 billion, product costs of 28%, operating expenses of 34% and a 24% tax rate, below our full year rate due to the recognition of R&D tax credits related to 2012, but not recognized until Congress reinstated them in early January 2013. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $0.29.","For the March quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $690 million. We expect non-GAAP product costs of 27%, operating expenses of 51% and a 21% tax rate, again, below our full year rate due to the previously mentioned R&D tax credits. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.10.","While the March quarter will be up year-over-year, the seasonality of our business will be very different in 2013 versus 2012. Considering the large success of Diablo III in the middle quarters of the year last year, our results will be much more concentrated in the holiday quarter this year.","From a balance sheet prospective, our expanded margins and low capital requirements improved our cash flow to $1.3 billion in 2012. We began 2013 with cash investments of $4.4 billion with around 60% held outside of the U.S.","This year, in addition to investing in our strong product pipeline and capabilities, we are also considering, or may consider, substantial stock repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, licensing or other non-ordinary course transactions and significant related debt financing. Although we are not going to discuss specifics initiatives today, I want to highlight that our Q1 and full year 2013 outlooks do not take into account any such transactions or financing that may or may not occur during the year. The exception being today's announced $0.19 cash dividend.","So in summary, 2012 was a great year with record financial results, strong product performance and solid digital and retail execution by our team. As we look forward, in spite of the near-term market challenges we face in 2013, we remain committed to the strategy that has successfully guided us through many difficult market transitions in the past. Notably, to focus on doing a few things exceptionally well and delivering differentiated long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. We are confident that this playbook will continue to set the bar for our industry going forward.","Now I will turn the call over to Eric, to speak about Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. I'm pleased to announce that in 2012, we delivered Activision Publishing's most profitable year ever, even better than the record year we had in 2011. We ended 2012 with 4 of the top 10 games in the U.S. and Europe combined, including toys and accessories. And we delivered revenues of over $3 billion and a record 32% operating margin.","Of course, none of this would be possible without the talent, passion and commitment of the best teams and employees anywhere in the entertainment industry, as well as all of our retail partners around the globe. And I want to thank each of them for helping us achieve this record milestone.","In 2012, in the U.S. and Europe combined, Call of Duty was the #1 video game franchise and Skylanders was the #3 video game franchise. 1 year ago on our earnings call, I said that we believe Skylanders is on its way to becoming our next billion-dollar franchise. And today, I'm pleased to announce that Skylanders has crossed the $1 billion threshold in revenues just 15 months after its debut.","This year, our consistent focus in deep investment has once again paid off. Black Ops II was the biggest game of the year and the fastest entertainment property ever to reach the $1 billion mark, which it did in just 15 days. Based on unique users, Black Ops II was the most played game on Xbox LIVE during 2012. And despite strong competition from new games, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Black Ops I both continued to be in the top 5 games played on the service.","More importantly, at the end of December, Black Ops II online engagement was the highest in the franchise's history, showing the continued momentum of the brand.","This year, our downloadable content will be supported by a free Call of Duty Elite service, which has a set of features unmatched in the industry, and this gives the franchise a competitive advantage and should further enhance the engagement of our community.","We are offering players 2 options to purchase Black Ops II DLC, the proven 1 Map Pack at a time model and a Season Pass, which lets fans buy our upcoming DLC Map Pack for a discounted suggested price of $50.","On January 29, we released our first DLC Map Pack, Revolution, on the Xbox. While it's still very early, we've been very pleased with the DLC results so far and, in fact, the combination of Season Pass and \u00e0 la carte DLC sales are tracking well ahead of last year's combination of Elite subscriptions and \u00e0 la carte DLC sets.","The Call of Duty franchise continues to set the bar for innovation and we expect the new Call of Duty game in development for 2013 to raise that bar even higher.","Also in development for the Call of -- for the franchise is Call of Duty Online for China, in partnership with Tencent. Tencent created the Free-to-Play action game model in China and is working closely with us to optimize Call of Duty for Chinese fans.","Now let's turn to Skylanders. As of the end of January, there were more than 100 million Skylanders toys in children's hands worldwide. And in 2012, we extended our reach at retail with more than 120 licensing partners and continued to gain operating efficiencies in our manufacturing and supply chain operations.","And just 2 days ago, in New York, we introduced our next innovation in the Toys to Life category, Skylanders SWAP Force. While others are just entering the category that we created, we're moving that category forward by introducing yet another innovative new play pattern, dynamic swapability. SWAP Force expands upon the success of the franchise as a signature gameplay by letting kids not only bring their toys to life, but to swap parts and create their own unique characters in the physical world, which are then recognized in the digital world. Reception at Toy Fair has been fantastic, and both the game and the toys look great.","Not only that, every character from both Spyro's Adventure and Skylanders Giants will be playable in Skylanders SWAP Force, adding tremendous value to those 100 million toys that kids have already collected.","Development also continues on our new ground-breaking project with Bungie. Bungie defined the action-shooter category with Halo, and we feel this project will once again deliver genre-defining innovation.","While we don't have a launch date to announce today, we expect to deliver incredible games with unprecedented marketing support for new IP. We look forward to sharing more information on this title in the near future.","We're also investing in new platforms and new models, including mobile Free-to-Play games. We were prudently hiring, not acquiring, the industry's best talents. In 2012, we launched 5 highly rated and top-selling mobile games, including our first Free-to-Play iOS game Skylanders Lost Islands.","While relative to the scale and profitability of our overall business, mobile is not yet a significant contributor. We have made smart, rightsized investments that should position us well for the future.","So to summarize. 2012 was a record year for Activision Publishing, driven by our continued focus on our biggest, most differentiated and most creative franchises. Black Ops II continued to set new records and Skylanders has become a fantastic success. And both Skylanders and Call of Duty had very innovative pipelines. We plan to continue innovating on our mega franchises and to introduce new high-potential franchises like our new Bungie universe and Call of Duty Online in China.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Morhaime.","Michael Morhaime","Thanks, Eric. 2012 was a busy year for Blizzard Entertainment. We had some very ambitious goals and successfully shipped 2 games, Diablo III and World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria. Our third game, StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, entered public beta testing in 2012 as well. On the year, Blizzard turned in strong financials with non-GAAP revenue of $1.6 billion and operating income of $717 million.","As of the end of the year, global subscribership for World of Warcraft added more than 9.6 million players, down slightly from the previous quarter. The majority of the decline came from China, while subscribership in the West was relatively more stable.","Looking ahead, the next major content update for World of Warcraft is already in testing and should reach players in the coming weeks. The development team continues to stick with the plan of more frequent content updates in the wake of the expansion launch, applying lessons that we've learned from past expansions.","Moving on to Diablo III. The launch of the game back in May had a tremendous impact on Blizzard and our community. Diablo III broke PC game sales records and as of the end of the year, had sold more than 12 million copies worldwide.","While this is a humbling achievement, we're not satisfied with merely breaking sales records. The development team has worked aggressively to update the games since the launch, adding new content, game systems, features and other improvements. A new update is in testing now, which will add dueling and other new content. Diablo is extremely important to Blizzard and we'll continue to invest aggressively to support the franchise and its community.","On the StarCraft side, we've had a flurry of activity surrounding the game in the past few months. The Battle.net World Championship in Shanghai this past November was a great success. A big congratulations go out again to PartinG from South Korea who was crowned our global champion.","The Heart of the Swarm beta has also been ongoing since last year and the team continues to improve the game with player feedback. Over the past couple of months, we've announced numerous new online features for the game, unveiling the opening cinematic, and conducted a global press showcase.","The feedback from the community about the campaign and new online features has been very positive and excitement continues to grow as we head into launch on March 12. Lastly, I want to remind everyone that BlizzCon will make its return later this year. We'll have more details announcements soon and we're looking forward to reconnecting with our players this year to hear their thoughts, share the latest Blizzard news and share along with them at the Blizzard eSports Global Finals. We hope you'll be able to join us at the show.","As we head into 2013, we'll continue to work hard on our pipeline of games and deliver on a great experience to our players. Thanks, and I'll turn the call back to Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thank you. Operator, we'll be ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","My question deals with Skylanders, and how you think about the franchise going forward if, in fact, we do have a new console cycle. What percentage of people are playing Skylanders on the Wii, and if people start transitioning more, Nintendo's starts losing some share to new consoles for Sony and Microsoft, how the game might be impacted that way?","Robert A. Kotick","Look, I think that's a very good question, Eric. And as you know, we were somewhat disappointed with the launch of the Wii U, and I think it's a challenging environment this year. And one of the things we are concerned about is what the installed base of hardware will be like for 6- to 11-year-olds. But we have a lot of confidence in the franchise for the long-term. I think we're delivering another great product this year. And Eric, you may want to say a little bit more -- but it's something we are concerned about.","Eric Hirshberg","Yes, you pretty much covered that. We've done well on all platforms, is all I wanted to day. The franchise has done well on all platforms and historically, the strongest franchises going into a console transition are the ones that fare the best. So I think that positions us well for Skylanders future.","Robert A. Kotick","Well, we haven't had any competition in the category. We have a new competitor and we are likely to have more. But we've invested a lot against it, we achieved a lot of good success so far and we have high expectations for the franchise going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","What do you think about the World of Warcraft and MMO community? Do you think the audience essentially remains strong and willing to play? Or do you think they're essentially in need of a new game? Can you talk about, really, the fatigue factor both in the MMO, as well as with specifically for the game, and then, I just have a follow-up question.","Eric Hirshberg","Well, we have seen an evolution in player behavior since the launch of Cataclysm. Players consume content quickly. There are more apps that come and go from the community, which is why we are targeting more frequent content updates. We are currently testing our second major update since Mists of Pandaria. I think that another thing to note is, if you compare the months following Cataclysm and the months following Mists of Pandaria, the trailing months have been stronger with Mists. And we have seen an increase in engagement in all regions with the launch of Mists of Pandaria.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Bobby, a quick one. You've been a vocal supporter of games direct to the TV. With more Smart TVs out there and also, the pending launch of consoles, how should we be thinking about this kind of direct-to-TV phenomenon with respect to games?","Robert A. Kotick","I'm not exactly sure I understand the question or what I supported historically. But I would say, another thing that we are concerned about is, as you start to see Internet-enabled televisions and the App Store reach the television with more -- with a much larger base, it's very hard for us to compete against free. I think there are challenges even at the $0.99. And so to the extent that you see a lot more Internet-enabled televisions, we're going to have the start thinking differently about the content that we would deliver to those Internet-enabled televisions.","Operator","We'll go next to Neil Doshi with Citi.","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dennis, it looks like we saw record high operating margins in Q4, both on the total company side, as well as on the Activision side. What drove this, and do you feel like this is kind of a long-term potential for the overall business? And then, Mike, if you can give a little more color on the China market, it seems like there's continuously intense competition there and most of the declines seem to come from the East. Is there anything you could do to be more competitive in that competitive market? And then any learnings you could share with the Activision side as they go in and launch Call of Duty China.","Dennis Durkin","Sure. Neil, let me give you a couple of points on margins. Obviously, it was a very strong quarter margin-wise, and I think it speaks to our long-term strategy about being very focused and trying to build enormous franchises. And we saw that in Q4, and you can really see the scale benefits of that happening on our margin structure across the business. And yes, these are record margins for our business that we've ever had. So going forward, though, I think one of the things to think about -- and you'll see this in our guidance is relative to how margins play out over the next 12 to 24 months. Last year we had the benefit of being late in the console cycle, which gives you a lot of benefits from a development perspective and from a monetization perspective. And margins, traditionally, in past console cycles which you see our guidance compressed a little bit as you kind of work your way through the transition of that. So you'll see that reflected in our guidance from an OpEx perspective as revenue comes down relative to some of those new platforms and then, in out years it starts to grow again and margins expand. So that's kind of the, at least, the high level in terms of how we see margins playing out over time, but last year was really the benefit of being late in the cycle and having the largest franchises. Mike, I don't know if you want to...","Michael Morhaime","Yes, so with respect to competition, we've always had competition for World of Warcraft in all markets. I think it's fair to say that competition has increased, but I think it's also important to point out that World of Warcraft is competing against, really, all forms of entertainment for leisure time. And so that just underscores the need for us to continue creating new content, to keep up engagements. With respect to China, in spite of the decline in subscribership, it is important to note that the engagement levels of the core audience did increase with the launch of the expansions and I think that, that suggests increased engagement by our core players.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Karimzad with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, quickly first, what's changed such as you're willing to publicly consider putting dead-on for strategic options? And then, Dennis, I have a housekeeping question on the add-up for guidance.","Robert A. Kotick","Well, I can't say that there's anything we can answer with respect to that disclosure. But we always are -- contemplating, always, to return capital to the shareholders.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Dennis, I think I -- maybe I have a number transposed or something, but when I take the non-GAAP guide here, so $4.175 billion on the revenue side and then, it sounds like you're adding up to a 31% margin. And then, put the tax rate on that because it really, generally, isn't much in between, I'm getting to -- closer to $0.85 in EPS, so can you help me understand what I'm missing here?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. Let me take you through our full year numbers on the GAAP side. I'm not sure where your math is breaking down, but I think we were pretty specific in terms of our announcement on that. So I can walk you through, I mean, I'd say it's probably best that we walk you through the numbers right after the call in terms of all the specifics, because it's -- if $0.80 is relative to what we have in there on our margin structure, COGS structure, revenue and totals.","Operator","We'll go next to the Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","Bobby, relative to your comments about connected TVs and the efforts that you've had to date in console gaming with, first, you tried it with Call of Duty, tried the service for Wii and then it's transferred more to the Season Pass. In digital, on iOS, we have seen some interesting success with episodic content, specifically, the Walking Dead, and I wonder if that's a way that -- an issue you might be addressing, creating some more of a consistent revenue stream from consumers without the big ticket $60, $70 price tags for games. And then that brings me to related questions. When we look at next gen, in the last gen, we saw prices rise, because development costs were rising. Do you see the same upward pressure in development costs for this coming generation? Will it be the need for an upward trend in pricing, or is it not to be that traumatic this time around?","Robert A. Kotick","Okay, so that's a lot of questions. I would say, the first the thing is that what we've seen today on our iOS-related content, relative to the business that we're in, we're not really moved to dial that significantly. Having said that, we're investing in a variety of initiatives. We're looking at those things carefully. There's nothing that we see on the near-term pipe pricing that's going to have a meaningful impact on our financial results. But we're an opportunistic company and we're always exploring new areas that could be reasonable returns for our shareholders. You know what? I don't really know how to answer your second question, to tell you the truth. Maybe you could be a little more specific.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","Do you expect development costs to rise on a like-for-like basis for this coming next gen?","Robert A. Kotick","So this is my 22nd year doing this, and in every single console transition, we've seen an increase in development costs. Over long periods of time, it gets smoothed out, but I would say this is not a transition where that's going to be an exception. We're going to have to figure out how to take advantage of the unique capabilities of new hardware, and that requires new skills and investment in tools and technology and engines and so yes, that's likely.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Andrew D. Connor - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is Andrew Connor in for Mike. I promise I will not ask you any questions about the consoles. But my question is really about Call of Duty and the reacceleration that we saw in the month of December. I'm curious if that has anything to do with the focus on the multiplayer component of Call of Duty versus the single player campaign and whether that's a strategic focus for the franchise going forward?","Eric Hirshberg","Well, I wouldn't say we're any more or less focused on multiplayer this year than we have been in years past. We delivered an extensive campaign, as well as a very deep multiplayer experience. I think that Treyarch did deliver an exceptional multiplayer game and it followed up with exceptional DLCs so far. And I think, as always, the quality of the content is the thing that drives our results the most.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Creutz with Cowen.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wonder if you could talk a little bit about where you are in Call of Duty China? I think last year, you had said that you expect to launch in 2013, and maybe even in the first half of 2013. And just, are you sort of on your launch plan? Do you still expect to get it out this year? You mentioned in your guidance, you don't have anything in for, but is that just a measure of conservatism around the revenue, or are you actually contemplating the idea that you might not ship it this year?","Eric Hirshberg","Well, as I've said, we don't have any dates to announce or specifics to announce, and also I would note, that there a lot of things beyond our control with this project, a, that we're working with a partner; and b, that we have government approvals to contend with. So there are a lot of variables at play here. And our guidance is our guidance for a reason and that's all we really have on the topic today.","Operator","And we'll go next to Drew Crum from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could talk about the discussions you're having with retailers, planned shelf space for Skylanders, given the increased competition you referenced in your preamble. And then also, can you talk about your plans for your shooter business given the impending launch -- or the eventual launch of the Bungie game against your Call of Duty franchise? In terms of cadence, would you launch 2 games in the same time period, same quarter? Just give your comments on that.","Eric Hirshberg","In terms of Skylanders, if the response we're seeing from our retail partners at Toy Fairs' is any indication, we expect to increase our retail presence and strength, not decrease. And I do think that our retail execution has been one of the shining stars and reasons for our success on this franchise. So I don't see any reason why we would think that would change.","Robert A. Kotick","I already said that we don't run out of competitors...","Eric Hirshberg","Yes, I was just going to say, we take every competitor seriously. And we've had -- sort been a competitor to ourselves thus far, but Skylanders is a proven force and we feel very confident about our partner's continued support for the franchise. Could you repeat your second question?","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, as far as the Bungie game, would you consider releasing it in close proximity to one of your Call of Duty releases, or do you need to create separation between the 2 in order to avoid cannibalization?","Eric Hirshberg","Yes, we don't just have any announcements at this time, on our timing on Bungie. We really look forward to sharing it with you, just as soon as we are ready.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of things. First of all, just a follow-up on Doug's question with regards to Call of Duty in China. Can you just let us know what steps need to be taken at this point before the game does release commercially? And since I'm last, I'll take advantage of that. A couple of other questions. First of all, looking at Skylanders, can you give us a sense as to what the attach rate is like from toys to games or a revenue split between toys and games? And then, thirdly, Bob if you can just -- going back to the comments with regards to potentially using debt or using cash and doing an acquisition, can you give some -- can you reiterate your philosophy around the acquisition strategy?","Eric Hirshberg","So I'll start with the China and Skylanders questions. On Call of Duty Online, we really -- this is where our partnership with Tencent is going to come to the fore. They are really the pioneers in that category and in this market, obviously, so we're following their lead. There are a number of steps from alpha testing and beta testing and refining, and of course, there's the government approval process. And we hope that -- we expect all those to go as planned, with Tencent really driving the ship through those things. In terms of Skylanders, the question was?","Robert A. Kotick","Skylanders attach rate.","Eric Hirshberg","Attach rate, which we don't break out on the toys that we can -- we've shared a lot of data today on the strength and the number of toys that we've sold and obviously, it's a great business. If you just look at it as a toy business, it would be the best-selling action figure line and better-selling than Star Wars and Transformers combined. And the software sales have been strong as well. And our ability to continue to drive that attach ratings has been one of the secrets to our success.","Dennis Durkin","I would  just, just to add on that -- to build on than that comment. The Skylanders, one of the benefits of it is the forward-compatibility of the toys. So it is -- you get the added benefit of your installed base essentially so -- or when you buy the next games. So that's been a huge factor for us but -- so calculating the exact attach rate becomes tough when you have multiple SKUs in the market for at the same time.","Robert A. Kotick","Ed, I really can't comment on any acquisitions.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Okay. On behalf of everyone at Activision Blizzard, we want to thank you for your time and consideration today, and we look forward to talking with you soon. Good night.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"661":["Activision Blizzard, Inc.

In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Bobby Kotick","Thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenues and earnings per share. As we continue to transform the company, we've remained focused on the delivery of epic entertainment that connects and engages the world.","We believe we can do this with greater speed and efficiency, while maintaining our long-standing commitment to quality and excellence and providing superior returns to our shareholders.","We ended the year with over 400 million monthly active users, strong year-over-year engagement and significant potential in monetization. We are in the privileged position of having a direct digital connection with hundreds of millions of players to whom we can deliver some of the worlds best professionally produced content.","And we have the ability to provide our audiences with a variety of ways to enjoy our content with monetization through subscriptions, premium digital purchases, digital native advertising and a variety of other player investment mechanisms. Each of our large franchises, as well as our new potential franchises have greater opportunities than ever before.","Using Call of Duty as an example, with the introduction of Call of Duty Mobile, we grew our player base from 40 million to 100 million players in less than a year. And we expect significant growth in the Call of Duty franchise in 2020 as compared to 2019, as a result of this and from other unannounced Call of Duty initiatives.","Mobile, in fact, is now our leading platform. The business model for Call of Duty Mobile is free to play, which enables the rapid development of large community of players with the option to purchase digital items and services as well as our ability to generate advertising revenues.","Franchises like Call of Duty offer advertisers a very difficult to reach target. And today the ad load is extremely low as we're experimenting with the best advertising solutions for our players and our advertising partners.","So we successfully developed great game through Mobile. Our franchises have the power to attract far bigger audiences than previously. We are hard at work on high quality mobile games for all of our most important franchise.","And with respect to esports, two weeks ago we debuted the Call of Duty League with 12 city-based teams. Working closely with our experienced team owners and globally recognized sponsors, we are thrilled to celebrate our players and inspire our community with professional Call of Duty esports.","And with our new strategic broadcast relationship with YouTube, over 200 million game reviewers now have access to our world-class esports content for both Call of Duty League and Overwatch League.","Across console, PC, mobile and touch points like esports the momentum for Call of Duty could not be stronger. And this success illustrates the larger opportunities we have across our diverse and large wholly owned library of titles dating back to our founding 40 years ago.","Having our franchises on all platforms in all geographies with a constant flow of content and leveraging the additional touch points we have available to us like esports and advertising, continues to be our focus.","Another great example of our franchise transformation is what happened with Warcraft. We doubled the size of the active World of Warcraft community in the second half of 2019 by adding Classic to the WoW subscription offering. The remarkable growth of the WoW community represents an important proof point of the value and potential of our established franchises. And it is energized our development team as we develop new content for all of our key franchises.","These franchises form the basis for large, engaged communities of players and spectators with whom we take our responsibility to deliver high quality content very seriously.","Prioritization of opportunity and access to more talent are our challenges. But we are meeting these challenges with improved execution, and we expect to grow audiences, engagement and monetization, and provide superior shareholder returns as we have for the last 30 years.","The final note, we wanted to acknowledge the tragedy of Kobe Bryant's untimely passing. Kobe was a long-time friend of the company, starring masterfully in commercials for Guitar Hero and Call of Duty. He was a tireless supporter of our veteran\u2019s employment initiatives and always made himself available for all of our veteran\u2019s events and activities. He will be greatly missed by all of us and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.","And now, Coddy will review the highlights of our operations with you.","Coddy Johnson","Thanks, Bobby. Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum. That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources of our biggest franchises and allowed us to accelerate progress against our four key growth pillars. And our first growth pillar, driving a consistent cadence of major new content to grow our reach, our expanded Call of Duty development team launched a very successful Modern Warfare. The unit sell-through in Q4 increasing by a double-digit percentage versus the prior year across console and PC combined. And the team followed up with great execution on our second growth pillar, live operations for [Indian] [ph] content services, features and events to drive engagement and recurring revenues.","Modern Warfare's first season of follow on content [indiscernible] our new more engaging in game system's throughput engagement and net bookings up significantly year-over-year. Similarly, the World of Warcraft team followed up on the remarkable Q3 launch of WoW Classic with substantial content updates that kept the community engaged and the subscriber base well above pre-Classic levels. In Hearthstone, we've seen increased engagement on the launch of Blizzard's latest expansion and the roll-out of the new Battlegrounds [game] [ph] in Q4.","As for our third pillar, extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to Mobile, the October launch of Call of Duty Mobile was one of the most successful in the industry history, driving Activision Publishing to record among the active users. It also highlighted the opportunity for our other large franchises to reach hundreds of millions of new players once they expand on the Mobile. And finally, as we build and enhance new engagement models for our franchises, our advertising business again grew rapidly, and we further strengthened our leadership in esports. We expect to build on this momentum in 2020 with each of these pillars driving net bookings growth for the company this year.","I'll now provide more detail on our Q4 results and recent developments across our franchises. Starting with Activision, Q4 was a fantastic quarter. Monthly active users tripled in Q3 to reach 128 million. Call of Duty continued its leadership on console with Modern Warfare driving year-on-year [indiscernible] in generating more upfront console sales than any other franchises worldwide a feat that franchise had now accomplished with 10 of the last 11 years. Modern Warfare also saw strong growth in full-game downloads with console digital mix at almost 50%. And we ended Q4 with the retail channel at its tightest level in many years positioning us well for ongoing catalog sales in 2020. Franchise also expanded it's audience on PC, with Q4 PC sell-through on Battle.net growing 50% year-over-year. This growing across platform Call of Duty community received in early December, the largest free content offering in franchise history along side of new system for player investment. And as a result, Q4 in-game net bookings grew by double-digit percentage year-over-year despite a later launch of in-game system and despite the removal of the season pass.","Now the second season of Modern Warfare follow on content launches next week. And the team has more great experiences and surprises in store both for that season and throughout 2020, which we expect to drive strong in-game net bookings growth year-over-year. And of course, the Call of Duty franchise started breakout success in Q4 with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile. The game has received widespread acclaim, and with over 150 million installed has brought a huge number of new players into the franchise, and given existing players, new way to experience Call of Duty. Engagement is strong, which the teams from Activision and Tencent [indiscernible] long-term with a substantial pipeline of features, events and content benefiting from over 15 years of Call of Duty releases. The title outperformed our net bookings expectations in Q4, ranking in the top 15 growth communities app stores, and the third season is already well underway and tracking well. So across console, PC, mobile and esports, the Call of Duty franchise has never been better positioned for growth and there is more to come, including entirely new experiences within the Modern Warfare universe, and then, of course, in Q4 of this year, a new premium Call of Duty release, which is already generating excitement in our play tests.","Finally, across the Activision portfolio, we are honored to see the team is focused on high-quality world-class content recognized by the industry the 2019 game rewards. Call of Duty Mobile won Mobile Game of the Year, Crash Team Racing won best game in the sports and our racing category, and FromSoftware's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice won Game of the Year.","Turning to Blizzard, monthly active users were 32 million in the fourth quarter. World of Warcraft monthly active users were higher sequentially, reflecting sustained engagement of players from the August launch of World Classic. Blizzard's recreation of the original out from 15 years ago. As you may remember, in Q3, World added more monthly or longer-term subscription plans than in any prior quarter in franchise history. That momentum continued in the Q4. When Blizzard sustained engagement with robust better content for both Modern and Classic world, and exited the year with an active community, more than twice the size of its Q2 ending level. That strong cadence of content will continue in 2020 with a great series of in-game releases for Classic and a strong Shadowland expansion coming from Modern world in the second half of the year. Shadowlands got new reasons to explore new ways to customize characters and our revamped leveling systems of on-board of new players.","In Hearthstone, the competitive environment remains intense. But we did see sustained improvement engagement find release of Descent of Dragons expansion and the new Battlegrounds auto-battler mode in Q4. Q4 net bookings were lower year-over-year, but grew sequentially and the Hearthstone team continues to be very quickly. They launched new games store in December, and released a number of new content engagement model enhancements in 2020. Q4 also saw the launch of Overwatch on Nintendo Switch further expanding the community that has now surpassed 50 million of players since the 2016 launch. And that has begin the Overwatch League returns to 20 teams from around the world competing in the Homescan [ph] format for the first time. Blizzard's teams, as you know, are working on the brightest pipeline in its history, including Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 of PC and console, and Diablo Immortal, a mobile game, developed in partnership that is continues to make good progress, and will move into the testing phase with its first regional test planned for the middle of the year.","Turning to King. Monthly active users were 249 million, increasing 2 million form the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a decline in web and smaller mobile titles, but importantly Candy mobile and benefited from growth in King's largest title Candy Crush Saga. In the second half of 2019, King introduced new initiatives to grow payer conversion targeting last payers as well as converting new payers into the ecosystem. And these initiatives started encouraging payer engagement trends in the last two quarters. While these initiatives dampened in-game net bookings in Q4, and we'll continue to do some in Q1, we believe a broader and more engaged player base positions the franchise for growth over the medium-term and long-term. And even with these actions, Candy Crush Saga remained a top grossing title in the US app stores and a wider franchise, was once again number one.","King's advertising business grew net-bookings over 80% year-over-year with strong growth in [indiscernible] users, volume and pricing. Both direct and indirect sales grew sharply for the full-year ad net-bookings exceeded $150 million with the business set for robust growth again in 2020. [indiscernible] will continue to optimize the economy within Candy launching ongoing features, services and events to drive player engagement and investment. And having previously narrowed its pipeline is focused on the highest potential projects, King is investing in several promising new titles, including content-based on acquisitions below that catalog IP. Regional testing of some of these new titles will begin in 2020. In conclusion our strategy, to focus on our growth pillars and investment creative in commercial resources and initiatives of our biggest franchises is delivering results. In 2020, we will continue that focus with the releases and pipeline initiatives highlight today to further expand our reach, engagement, and player investment, and to extend our largest IP across new platforms, geographies and business models. We plan to reach more players on more platforms in more regions than ever before. To do so, we'll also further increase investment in our technology capabilities, technology platforms and data analytics while fund these investments with an ongoing focus on efficiency and organizational optimization to leverage our scale across the business. And we know that some of our investments won't bear fruit until next year. We're confident in our growth trajectory this year, and our growth plan and we enter 2020 with momentum.","I'll now hand the call over to Dennis to discuss our Q4 and full-year financial results and outlook. Dennis?","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Coddy. Today I will review our Q4, 2019 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the first quarter. Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were ahead of our prior outlook reflecting better than expected results for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft and a lower tax rate. To review the quarter, I'll start with our Q4 segment results. Activision revenue was $1.43 billion led by Call of Duty growth in both upfront and in-game revenues on console and PC, and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile operating income was $696 million with an operating margin of 49%. As expected, Call of Duty Mobile was not a material contributor operating income in Q4 despite a great launch, as we invested to build our player base and position the title for long-term success.","Blizzard revenue was $595 million, lower year-over-year as growth for World of Warcraft an Overwatch was offset by a decline for Hearthstone and Diablo. Operating income was $260 million with the revenue decline more than offset by lower costs. Blizzard's operating margin was 44%, significantly higher year-over-year due to mix and lower costs. King revenue of $503 million was flat sequentially and lower year-over-year, driven primarily by King's actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter as well as year-over-year decline in web titles. The ads business grew more than 80% year-over-year. Operating income was $197 million with an operating margin of 39%, one point higher year-over-year, driven by high incremental margins from advertising. Across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.1 billion.","Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.0 billion, $174 million above our November guidance. This includes the net deferrals of $722 million. Net bookings of $2.7 billion were $62 million above our November outlook. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $30 million, and we generated Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.68 and Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, which was $0.19 above guidance. These figures include the net deferrals of $0.61. For the year, we generated GAAP revenues of $6.5 billion. This includes the net recognition of deferrals of $101 million. Net bookings were $6.4 billion. We incurred GAAP-only restructuring and related charges of $137 million and generated GAAP EPS of $1.95 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.31. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.06.","From a cash flow perspective, our business delivered Q4 operating cash flow of $918 million. Annual operating cash flow was $1.8 billion, higher year-over-year due to lower working capital and cash taxes. Our cash and investments at the end of December was approximately $5.9 billion. And we ended the year with a net cash position of approximately $3.2 billion.","Turning to capital allocation, we entered 2020 with a strong balance sheet and significant flexibility. As always, we continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. And with this in mind, our Board has authorized an 11% increase in our annual dividend to $0.41 per share, payable in May. As we look back over the last year, we are pleased with the company's operating discipline, commercial execution and content delivery during a period where we refocused the business and increased investment in key franchises to position us for future growth.","Now let's look forward to our outlook for 2020. First, regarding our slate and plans for each business unit. Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty across upfront sales in-game mobile and esports. Along with the tight retail channel that should benefit catalog sales, this positions us for strong growth in the franchise, particularly in the first half of the year. In Q4, we plan to launch the next premium release of Call of Duty. We can't wait to unveil what our teams have been working on, and we feel great about the content. Although as is customary, we are prudently assuming lower sell-in for Q4 versus Modern Warfare this past year.","Turning to Blizzard. which just last week released Warcraft III Reforged. Blizzard will build on World of Warcraft momentum with ongoing content for Classic and the Shadowlands expansion in the second half of the year. The Hearthstone and Overwatch teams will support their communities with ongoing content and services that drive engagement and player investment. And as Coddy mentioned, Diablo Immortal is planned to enter a regional testing towards the middle of the year, but we don't have any material revenue from that title in our guidance. King will continue to release content, features, services and events across its portfolio with an ongoing focus on optimizing reach, engagement and player investment for Candy. And the advertising business is set to deliver another year of strong net bookings growth. At the same time King will continue to invest in several promising new titles in its pipeline. And although we expect regional play testing for certain titles, similar to Diablo Immortal, our outlook does not include material revenue from these titles. In addition, our business units will continue to tap into our portfolio of beloved IP to bring several remastered and re-imagined experiences to our players in 2020, which we will announce closer to launch.","Bringing all this together, our outlook reflects 5% year-over-year growth in net bookings. We expect Activision to experience the strongest net bookings growth amongst our segments both in dollar terms and on a percentage basis. We expect solid net bookings growth from Blizzard for the year, and our outlook reflects a flattish performance at King with year-over-year trends improving in the second half of the year. From a margin perspective, our outlook reflects GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin increasing year-over-year.","Now let's turn to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2020, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including net deferrals of $275 billion. We expect net bookings of $6.73 billion. Product cost game operations and distribution expenses of 22%, operating expenses, including software amortization of 50%, and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $50 million. We expect the GAAP tax rate of 19%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $778 million and GAAP EPS of $1.85. For 2020, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost game operations and distribution expenses of 23%, operating expenses including software amortization of 44%, we expect a tax rate of 19% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.22, including net deferrals of $0.13.","Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.64 billion, including the net recognition of deferrals of $365 million. We expect net bookings of $1.28 billion. Product cost, game operations and distribution expenses of 21%, operating expenses including software amortization of 48%, and a GAAP-only restructuring charge of approximately $35 million.","We expect the tax rate of 17%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $775 million and GAAP EPS of $0.55. For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost game operations and distribution expenses of 21%, and operating expenses including software amortization of 41%. We expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.66, which includes the net recognition of deferral of $0.31. In closing, in 2019, we have come a long way and refocusing the business on our biggest franchises and opportunities. So momentum for World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and our new engagement models highlights the growth potential for our broader portfolio of durable fully owned franchises, and we apply our top creative talent and commercial talent against our biggest opportunities.","We are encouraged by our 2019 results, and as we return to growth in 2020, the opportunity set for our business across platforms, geographies and business models has never been greater. Going forward, we will maintain our operating discipline and focus as we execute against a great content line up this year and a pipeline that includes Overwatch 2, Diablo IV and Diablo Immortal and multiple unannounced initiatives, including several mobile titles. We remain confident that ongoing execution against our plan will position us to deliver growth to our shareholders over the long term.","Now I welcome our business leaders Jay, Humam and Rob as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mario Lu with Barclays.","Mario Lu","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple on Call of Duty Modern Warfare. How has not having a season pass affected user behavior thus far compared to years past? And secondly, any color you can provide regarding its impact on in-game revenue growth, and what we can expect in 2020? Thanks.","Bobby Kotick","Yeah, Mario. It's Rob. Thanks for the question. I think, before I touch on season pass, specifically, it's important that we kind of step back for a second and look at some of the macro changes that we made, and season pass is one of them. Our intent was just to create a better overall experience for our player community, and we think we've done that. The first big thing we did was bring in crossplay and cross progression enabling friends that play together no matter what platform they are on. In the case of Modern Warfare, it's just great to see players come back together after so many years of experience in franchise in the past.","Now with season pass, it kind of played a similar role, right? So instead of certain portions of the audience having certain content, we're focused now on free content for the entire community to drive engagement with the overall community. And I'd say the last big change that we made was really focusing on the new battle pass and item shop system in the game giving players kind of more transparency to the content thereafter and, obviously, focusing more on cosmetic content. And I suppose the best way to judge all of it is just what's the player behavior and what's the community saying. And when we look at engagement, you look at daily average unique. Our engagement is up significantly year-over-year, and that's really great for us to see so many people enjoying and playing this fantastic game.","And then on the player investment side, I'd say fans certainly seem to be appreciating the new system quite a bit. We mentioned kind of the growth year-on-year, but one other thing, I might, add is that we're also seeing an increased attach rates in game to the new system, which I think is a very, very positive sign for us. And for us, this all signals to a really healthy ecosystem within Modern Warfare, one that we think we can build on and create momentum with our community. It's really on us from now to really build great content, which we intend to do for the long haul on this game, a great pipeline of content is coming starting with Season 2 next week. And we have some surprises in store beyond that. So I'd say overall, what we expect is a healthier Call of Duty in 2020 versus the previous year. And we look forward to sharing more in the future, but thanks for the question.","Mario Lu","Okay. Thank you.","Coddy Johnson","Thanks, Mario.","Chris Hickey","Operator, the next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Benjy Scurlock with Arete Research.","Benjy Scurlock","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one on King. So when do you expect to see engagement on monetization stabilize, and the King segment start to reaccelerate? Thanks.","Humam Sakhnini","Thanks for the question. This is Humam. So overall growth is impacted by some of our smallest titles and the [one] [ph] platform. We also had a number of initiatives more recently and they are driving player conversion and bringing back lapsed players and that presented near-term trade-off, but it's the right thing to do for the medium-term and beyond. And we'll continue to see some of those trade-offs in Q1. But -- with all that said, when I look forward, I see a number of growth areas at King. First and foremost is Candy. Candy continues to be an incredibly durable franchise. And we see growth just through the slate of new features, all the services we're releasing and the in-game events that we hold. More recently, we are also thinking quite a bit about our social features. We've seen that really work in different battles and in different genres. And when I think about how that could be in Candy, and the size of Candy, that could be a big unlock for us.","Another thing that's really looks for growth is our advertising business. So as you heard, that's really coming along really nicely. And we've built a really large and high margin business, and I see growth there. And then additionally, I see growth in our pipeline. We reset our pipeline recently and we're starting to see some really good results, and our prototypes, and we will start doing some regional testing on some of those this year. So when I put all that together, I look to the medium-term and beyond than I think. We have some really good growth opportunities here.","Chris Hickey","Thanks, Benjy. Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust.","Anthony Duplisea","Hey, this is Anthony on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. Do you have any color on how successful World of Warcraft has been in 4Q and into 2020 in retaining users from the Classic mode launch? And then relatedly also on Warcraft, there's been some negative press on Warcraft 3 reforged lately. Can you tell us what you're doing to address that? Thanks.","J. Allen Brack","Hi, this is Jay. I will talk about like the World of Warcraft question first. So, as a reminder, when we designed the model for World of Warcraft Classic, it was important that players have a single existing subscription to support both games. And we think about the WoW community as supporting both even though Classic and Modern are very distinct experiences. And we're committed to kind of continuing to support both of those experiences over the long term. Given the content updates for Modern WoW, and the cadence that we have for Classic, we exited our year with the subscriber base that was doubled what it was at the end of Q2. And we also see players remaining engaged in both versions of the game. And we launched Visions of N\u2019Zoth which is a content patch for Modern WoW in January. Engagement with Classic has been particularly strong in the East, and we see very high levels of player retention there. And our next update for Classic is going to be Phase 3, which is Blackwing Lair. It's one of my favorites. And we're planning on launching that on February 13. Concerning Warcraft III Reforged, honestly, it's been a bit of a hurry. Our community has come to expect really amazing things from us, and we've heard from them that we did not achieve that bar. But we stand behind our games and have consistently shown that not only do we support them, but we continue to build on them even after launch. And we're committed to doing that here as well. And so we're going to continue to update the game and we'll continue to update the community with our plans going forward. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ben [ph] with Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. You now have about $3 billion of net cash on the balance sheet. You've got the annual dividend, have done some buybacks in the past some acquisitions. Maybe just an update on the thoughts around capital allocation and uses of cash against the opportunities ahead? Thanks.","Coddy Johnson","Yeah. No. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we do view a strong balance sheet as a really important strategic asset for the company and having that gives us considerable flexibility to invest in the business do buybacks and return capital or pursue M&A when we see attractive opportunities. And our track record probably somewhat speaks for itself as you look at that over a long period of time. We borrowed, I'd say, very fortuitously to finance our Vivendi transaction, our King transaction and then subsequently pay down that debt. So we paid down more than $4 billion since we financed those transactions and actually have climbed our way up the investment grade ratings grid. And then we've returned over the last decade, more than, I guess, around $10 billion of capital back to our shareholders. About $8 billion through share repurchases and we still do have our $1.5 billion authorization, and then about $2 billion over that time period in dividends, which has increased double digits, I'd say, probably on average over the course of that period, and again this year with the $0.41 dividend, which we announced today. ","M&A is always something we keep our eye on, and as we have our radar detectors up, and we always look at a lot of things, but we -- I'd like to think we're pretty disciplined about our process. We do have a pretty rigorous process and we try to look for a few criteria of things when we are considering it. We're always trying to find great franchises of our technology that could add to our portfolio and make our business in our franchise portfolio stronger. We'd like to see a track record of profitability or path to profitability, a strong leadership team that's aligned around growing the business. And then lastly, and this one has been more challenging is finding things at a valuation that makes sense. So it's not easy to find all those things. And so you have to be very disciplined and patient as you think about those inorganic opportunities. So that gives you a little bit of an overview in terms of how we've approached it, I think, our past track record and philosophy on this is probably the best indicator of how we think about it and how we will allocate capital in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","Hey, thanks for the question. Could you just give us an update on Diablo Immortal and discuss how that informs your go-forward mobile strategy for Blizzard? Thanks.","Bobby Kotick","Absolutely. So as you know, we've been working closely with NetEase on the development of the game. And our goal is to deliver an authentic and deep Diablo experience for mobile. We did show an updated version of the game at BlizzCon last year, and we saw a lot of excitement. We've also begun doing internal play tests or additional internal play tests since that time and the results are encouraging. We're getting ready to move to the next phase of development with some regional Alpha testing later this year. Player feedback is invaluable. And as we continue to work on building the game, we will be looking to that feedback to make sure that we're making a really a great Diablo experience. When we think about -- when I think about mobile overall for Blizzard, we have our roots in PC gaming. And we're going to continue to be deeply committed to the PC. But we do think there are opportunities for additional experiences in a different ways for players to engage on different kinds of devices. And we see Mobile is also a way to attract players that we don't currently reach on PC and console. So we think the mobile opportunity for Blizzard overall is very substantial. And Diablo Immortal will be our first release as a mobile first game. And we continue to work on multiple mobile initiatives across Blizzard in addition to the PC and console games.","Chris Hickey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.","Colin Sebastian","Thanks. Digging down a little bit more into your relationship with Google. I'm wondering what the key factors behind the decision to partner with GCP. And then as well as YouTube gaming, are there -- as well there considerations or implications embedded that could increase your level of support first area? Thank you.","Coddy Johnson","Sure. Hey, this is Coddy. I'll take that. And I'll take first, as Bobby mentioned in really today in an interview, we've had a long-standing relationship with Google that's been great. We are thrilled to formalize that into a deeper partnership over multiple years. And as you said, there's really two big pieces to it. The first is on sort of the global IT infrastructure, and then the second is on what really is just a fantastic content platform in YouTube. On the first piece, what we have the opportunity to do now is have a more efficient and better delivery in the back-end services and infrastructure handled by our partner where that is their great expertise. And what would allow us to do is it frees up our resources and developers and mind share to focus on what we do best, which is making the content in getting it out into the hands of our players at a faster cadence. That is a great balance of trade for us and we feel really good about that partnership, and how that carry us going forward. On the content side on YouTube, there's 200 million gamer viewers on YouTube. And it's just a tremendous opportunity to bring our platform to new audiences there. We think not only just in the way that players can experience it today, put new modes and formats. and also YouTube is a great on-demand viewing platform. And we think viewers might be increasingly interested in viewing our content that way. There are other pieces to this deal where there is real value we think in terms of how we utilize their platforms and how they help us build more reach and engagement in our ecosystem, not in this deal, and you mentioned it is steady. There's cloud game streaming experiences that are driving to the consumer. We continue to watch with interest and will make appropriate assessments as we go forward to figure out our own next steps there. But I think one point to is just as the last thought, a broader point, which is over the last two years, we've been talking about these large technology players that are coming to our space at scale. What we've said is we see this tremendous opportunity as a content provider to take advantage of where we sit in the space. And this we could use an example. It's just a large amount of value for us as we go forward, and we think we're only even better positioned for other partnerships as we take next steps.","Colin Sebastian","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan","Thank you so much for taking the question. Can you provide us an update on how Call of Duty mobile is trending in terms of engagement retention of users? How we should be thinking about future content as a driver of monetization for that property going forward? And second part, any key learnings that we should be aware of as you're learning to develop mobile games at that sort of scale? And how it might be applied to all the parts of the portfolio? Thanks so much for the call.","Bobby Kotick","Eric, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. Let me start with the last part of your question on the key learnings, and I apologize for being little redundant on this. But I think a key theme throughout our call is that, we go we learn more anything else is that the market is certainly ready for our franchises on mobile. When we make a great game and kind of stay true to the core tenants of what made the franchise great in the first place, and we execute on that. Now we can reach just millions of millions of people around the globe that may have never experienced our franchise before. And that's just -- that's very exciting for us as an organization because that obviously is true, not just for just Call of Duty, but also for the many great franchises that we have in the organization. If I were to turn back and talk about Call of Duty Mobile a little bit in terms of engagement and retention like you asked, look, I'd say it's still in the early days, but we've seen a number of encouraging signs. Obviously the install at the beginning, which we were reported out have been fantastic, but also in terms of our daily engagement are looking at our [indiscernible] Mobile hit levels that were multiples higher than any other title in franchise history. So that engagement basis really, really exciting for us to work from. Now for us the content now becomes on the content pipeline to sustain and build on that. In Mobile, we have a game at a platform essentially that we want to build on for a really long time to come. So we're hyper-focused on our content pipeline, our monthly, weekly, and daily events as they come into the game to make sure we drive the best possible experience for our player community there. We're in the middle of Season 3 right now, and that's tracking really well. And I think what we're going to see is we're learning a lot real time. the learnings are great. And you'll see us adjusting our content and continuing to make the best possible experience we can for our fans as we move forward in the future. So I'd say, right now, we're off to really a nice start and that I'm excited about. And we'll be reporting on our progress as we head in the future, but thanks for your question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler.","Mike Olson","Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. You touched on a bit, but could you update us on anything further related to the status of King advertising? How is it ramp throughout 2019? And what's your thinking on potential for 2020? Thanks.","Humam Sakhnini","Yeah, this is Humam again. Thanks for the question. So look I think advertising has been a real success story for King as we saw in 2019. We're really built a durable business here and it's a high margin one. And the way I think about it is with our scale of monthly, it really allows us to get the benefit of having such a large audience. As you know, small fraction of them participate in our in-game economy. So now it's become a needle mover for us. We crossed 150 million net bookings in 2019. And it's really a testament to a great collaboration between the product teams and the game teams and the advertising team, and really all of them thinking about what's a great player experience and how do we deliver something very differentiated for our advertisers. And so when I look to 2020 and beyond, I see continued growth. There are many avenues of that growth. First and foremost, we're going to continue to roll-out advertising to more and more of our players. And then, I think the teams will continue to innovate. There -- we already, as I said, have an incredibly differentiated products that advertisers really attaching to, but we can continue to make it better. A good example of this was in Q4 was some of the -- what we delivered to Sony Pictures on the Jumanji phone launch. And there, we not only had our flagship rewarded video product, but we did something truly differentiated in the marketplace where we put an in-game integration. We put some of the game -- the film characters in our game. That was greatly engaging for our players and it delivered tens of millions of views to Jumanji, and it really moved the needle for them too. So I think about continuing to move down that journey, and as we do that, we unlock more demand and we are working very closely with our agencies, while we also continue to build our direct sales team and continue to build kind of the infrastructure around it. So all in all, I think kind of that strategy that's been working continues to bear fruit for us. And I think there's plenty of growth ahead of us on good runway.","Chris Hickey","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our final question from Mike Hickey with Benchmark.","Mike Hickey","Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. You made a lot of changes, obviously, to Call of Duty this year. You introduced the cross platform. Newer game system, launched Mobile, obviously, has a huge success in esports. I guess to what extent we expect to see summer moves over the rest of your key franchises? Thank you.","Bobby Kotick","Thanks for the question, Mike. It's Bobby. When -- I think one of the things that we found with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile with games like Hearthstone, our designers and developers have gotten a lot more excited about reaching bigger, broader audiences. And we've seen that across the whole company. And so I think what you're going to continue to see is a commitment to innovation on all of our franchises and then now includes commitment to innovation with mobile devices. And I think that as long as we can deliver new innovative game play with great user experiences on mobile devices, you'll see more franchises taking advantage of that as a platform. I think the other thing we've seen is that people want to reach more customers in more countries and, especially when you look at some of the things that we're doing in esports, being able to build these big inclusive communities around the world in today, our mobile games are played in almost 200 countries. That's been a real catalyst for us to really rethink the way that we're approaching our franchise development. So you can expect, as Jay pointed out, obviously, as Humam can attest to and as we've been seen in the Activision business with the success of Call of Duty Mobile, Mobile is now our largest platform and you'll continue to see us with not just mobile touch points, but all the other important touch points that we've now added into the business, expanding the reach of our franchises, the engagement of our franchises and the monetization of our franchises. So we are going to be more enthusiastic about the prospects that we have going forward. We've talked a little bit about the challenges, which is prioritization of opportunity and making sure that we have the right talent aligned with those opportunities, but those are challenges we managed for a long time. So it's a great question. And I think you can expect that all of our franchises are investing in all of these new opportunities.","Chris Hickey","All right. Thanks, Bobby. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with many of you this quarter. And if not, we'll see you on our next earnings call in late April, early May.

In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a 1-page summary sheet.","And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.","Robert A. Kotick","Thank you, Kristin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Activision Blizzard delivered better-than-expected Q2 results. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated $658 million in revenues, with a record 73% from digital channels and earnings per share of $0.06.","For the first half of the year, we generated strong earnings and cash flow, we repaid $375 million of principal to reduce our term loan and we paid our highest ever dividend of $0.20 per share.","Based on our strong results this quarter and better visibility for the balance of the calendar year, we're raising our full-year outlook and expect to grow our non-GAAP revenues year-over-year and deliver record non-GAAP earnings per share this year.","We control some of the most valuable and iconic entertainment franchises, and we maintain some of the largest and most engaged online communities in the world, including Call of Duty, Skylanders, World of Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and now, Hearthstone. And all of these franchises are leaders in their respective categories.","Our teams continue to be among the very best in the world at innovating within our known franchises and creating exciting new franchises like Hearthstone and Destiny. We're seeing more opportunities to create great content for new platforms, new higher-margin business models and new geographies. And we're embracing these opportunities for growth with the same commitment to excellence we have demonstrated over the last 20 years.","As the world's most successful interactive entertainment company, we'll remain focused on the creation of the most compelling, engaging games for our dedicated committed audiences and providing superior returns for our shareholders, as we have for more than 2 decades.","I'm grateful for the continued determination and extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world and the continued support of our audiences and shareholders. And now, Dennis will share the results of our second quarter and provide an update on our view with the balance of 2014, which is shaping up to be an extraordinary year for Activision Blizzard.","Dennis Durkin","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review our better-than-expected Q2 financial results and then our outlook for Q3 and our increased outlook for 2014.","Starting with our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year, unless otherwise noted.","For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated better-than-expected revenues of $970 million, and operating margin of 32% and EPS of $0.28. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we generated revenues of $658 million, including a record 73% from digital channels, which drove an overall operating margin of 17% and EPS of $0.06.","Our strong performance was driven by 5 distinct franchises, which highlights the increasing breadth and depth of our expanding portfolio. Blizzard Entertainment's strong results were driven by World of Warcraft subscriptions, Warlords of Draenor prepurchases and paid character boost, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls expansion pack sales and sales of Hearthstone cards.","On the Activision Publishing side, performance was driven by Call of Duty: Ghosts, and Skylanders SWAP Force.","Turning to specific P&L items. Please note, all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q2, GAAP product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 43%, and operating margin was 32%, above our outlook, driven by higher-than-expected revenues and the timing of expenses. GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense was $52 million and our GAAP tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP weighted average share count was 725 million, and for EPS purposes, we also include 16 million of participating securities for a total of 741 million fully diluted shares.","On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 27%, slightly higher than expected due to over performance in our low-margin distribution business. Operating expenses were 56%, better than expected, and operating margin was 17%, above our outlook for the same reasons I mentioned for GAAP.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 20%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 29%.","In terms of EBITDA and cash flow, in Q2, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $131 million, which we define as non-GAAP operating income and then add back depreciation, as well as strong operating and free cash flow of $106 million and $81 million, respectively.","On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated nearly $1.1 billion of operating cash flow. We also paid out approximately $147 million related to our $0.20 per share dividend in May.","Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $4.2 billion in cash and investments, of which over $650 million was held domestically. With total debt of $4.4 billion, our net debt was approximately $150 million.","Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and for full year 2014.","For Q3, Blizzard launched the first content pack for Hearthstone, Curse of Naxxramas, for PC, Mac and iPad in July, and expects to launch Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition later this month for consoles. In September, Activision Publishing plans to release Destiny, which we believe will be one of the biggest selling titles of the year, and will establish yet another iconic franchise in the Activision Blizzard portfolio.","Turning to the numbers. In Q3, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $650 million, product costs of 27%, and operating expenses of 76%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $52 million, a GAAP tax rate of 30%. And with significant GAAP revenue deferrals in the future periods, we're expecting a GAAP loss of $0.07 in the quarter.","Note, we are using basic weighted average share count of 719 million shares for GAAP EPS. We expect a GAAP loss in the quarter. For Q3, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect record revenues of $975 million, product cost of 25%, and operating expenses of 60%. Note this includes heavy launch marketing costs for Destiny, as well as marketing expenses for our large Q4 lineup.","In addition, there will also be significant amortization of capitalized software development expenses for Destiny in both Q3 and Q4.","Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19%, a non-GAAP fully diluted share count of 745 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.11.","In Q4, we expect to launch Skylanders: Trap Team on October 5, and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on November 4. And for planning purposes, our outlook assumes a Q4 launch of the World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor expansion.","Now to our full year 2014 numbers.","On a GAAP basis, we expect increased revenues of $4.24 billion, product costs of 28% and operating expenses of 47%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $208 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect $750 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS of $0.91. For 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect increased revenues of $4.7 billion, representing 8% revenue growth year-over-year, product costs of 26%, operating expenses of 43%, operating margin of 32% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 25%. Today, we are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook by $0.02 to a record $1.29, representing 37% reported EPS growth year-over-year.","In summary, Activision Blizzard's expanding portfolio of industry-leading franchises delivered better than expected financial results during the first half of the year, and in the back half, we expect to deliver what we believe to be the strongest lineup in our history.","Today, we have more opportunities than ever before to increase our portfolio of premium content and to continue growing our large, socially connected communities worldwide by expanding our reach to new consumers, platforms and geographies. We also remain laser-focused on execution, while keeping a keen eye on cost, all of which should deliver long-term growth, strong margins and cash flows for our various stakeholders.","Now I will turn the call over to Eric Hirshberg to discuss Activision Publishing.","Eric Hirshberg","Thanks, Dennis. In Q2 Activision Publishing had the #1 selling title left to date on the next-generation consoles with Call of Duty: Ghosts, and the #2 title in the industry year-to-date with Skylanders SWAP Force. We believe our blockbuster launch this fall with Destiny, Skylanders and Call of Duty could deliver the largest second half revenues in Activision Publishing's history.","First up is Destiny, which we plan to launch on September 9, and the game is looking great. Our beta test attracted over 4.6 million players and the feedback was almost universally positive.","With that great consumer response, strong first-party support from Sony, very strong demand from our retail and digital distribution partners and a strong future pipeline of digital content, we believe more than ever that Destiny will become the biggest new IP launch in video game history, and over time, Activision's next billion-dollar franchise.","Preorders continue at a record pace for new intellectual property and other leading indicators like purchase intent and awareness are showing strength as well. On October 5, we plan to release Skylanders: Trap Team, a great game from our wholly-owned studio, Toys for Bob, the originators of both the franchise and the toys-to-life genre. In Trap Team, we're not only letting kids bring their toys to life, as we have in past games, we're also letting them bring life to their toys. This time, when you defeat bad guys, you can capture them in a crystal trap and make them fight for you, bringing yet another breakthrough innovation to the toys-to-life genre.","I think, this is our most magical Skylanders game yet. Since we revealed Trap Team, we have seen a 50% increase in our Skylanders YouTube channel views compared to last year. And while we have strong competition, we also have breakthrough innovation, a new lineup that has more price points and options for the consumer and unprecedented support from both first and third-parties, including Nintendo, General Mills and McDonald's.","We therefore expect Skylanders to continue to lead the toys-to-life category this fall and determining one of the most successful kids entertainment franchises in the world.","On November 4, we intend to launch Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, our incredibly talented wholly-owned studios, Sledgehammer Games, is delivering a truly extraordinary experience, with innovation across every game mode. Our best graphics ever and a campaign anchored by great story, as well as two-time Oscar winner, Kevin Spacey.","We also have an open launch window and we're taking full advantage of this with strong first-party support from Microsoft, highly engaged distribution partners and some of most our focused and we expect effective marketing programs ever.","Adding to this momentum is an active Call of Duty player community that has actually grown since our last earnings call. This is an unusual trend at this time of the year, which typically sees declining active player count.","This speaks to the continued strength of the Call of Duty franchise and healthy appetite for Call of Duty content as we head into Advanced Warfare's launch. And according to YouTube, our reveal trailer was the most viewed entertainment trailer in the second quarter, ahead of not only every other game, but also every movie and television show in North America. We expect Call of Duty to be the most pre-ordered game of the year and we're currently seeing strong purchase intent, in line with our past top-performing titles.","Finally, our development for Call of Duty Online in China is going great and gaining momentum. This is our first major free-to-play initiative and has just entered large scale testing, which means hundreds of thousands of gamers in China will be playing a closed beta over the coming months. This is part of our rollout strategically with Tencent, which is by far the largest gaming community in China. Call of Duty online is a major opportunity to expand our reach and to bring the franchise to a massive new player community.","So in closing, Activision Publishing had a strong second quarter and looks forward to delivering what could be our biggest second half ever. We expect our AAA launches to materially expand our portfolio and our reach, both this fall and in the future, with top line growth and increasing margins as the next-gen consoles continue to grow and expand our opportunities to drive high-margin digital revenues.","Thanks. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard.","Michael Morhaime","Thanks, Eric. Blizzard had a busy second quarter, reaching milestones on a number of projects. This includes the start of beta testing on World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, the release of Hearthstone on iPad, and ongoing testing of new content for Diablo III, and our unreleased team brawler, Heroes of the Storm.","Starting off with World of Warcraft. The franchise remains healthy with revenues up year-over-year. This is due in part to ongoing interest in Warlords of Draenor presales, which now exceed 1.5 million, and the character boost, which suggests strong support for the expansion by the community.","As we mentioned on the previous call, we anticipated fluctuation in subscribership due to seasonality and the fact that the current game content is at the end of its life cycle. And as expected, we did see a decline in subscribers, which mostly came out of the East. This pattern is right in line, percentage-wise, with the drops that we saw at Cataclysm's cycle in Q2 2012. That drop in 2012 was followed by an uptick in subscribers just ahead of Mists of Pandaria's launch. So we're hoping to see players return once we draw closer to the release of Warlords of Draenor later this year.","On the development side for World of Warcraft, we did begin beta testing for Warlords of Draenor in Q2. Q2 was also a big quarter for Hearthstone with the iPad version of the game launching in April. That version has been popular, bringing millions of new players into the Battle.net ecosystem, and building on momentum from Q1's PC launch. Hearthstone has also been growing in popularity on the e-sports side, with a number of big tournament events taking place around the globe. We also announced our year-long Hearthstone competition, which will collect competitors from around the world to compete at a yearend tournament at BlizzCon for a $250,000 prize pool. A few weeks ago, we launched Curse of Naxxramas, our first adventure mode content for Hearthstone, and it's now available around the world on Windows, Mac and iPad. The content is split into 5 parts released over 5-week period, and it includes single player challenges, as well as cards that players can use in head-to-head competition. Players can purchase the weekly content \u00e0 la carte for in-game gold or real money or as a bundle for real money. The community has responded with enthusiasm to Curse of Naxxramas, fueling Hearthstone's biggest week ever in terms of both engagement and revenue. We're pleased with the results and we look forward to continuing our support for Hearthstone going forward.","Moving on to Diablo III. We're pleased to show that the game has reached more than 20 million in unit sales, including digital. This figure includes the base Diablo III game on PC and console, and the Reaper of Souls PC expansion pack. We're looking forward to delivering the expansion content to players on next and current-gen consoles with the release of the Diablo III Ultimate Evil Edition, which we expect to ship on August 19. In addition to the Reaper of Souls content, the Ultimate Evil Edition includes all of the updates that we made to the core Diablo III experience on PC, as well as some console-exclusive features that make it even easier and more rewarding for friends to play together.","And lastly, we just announced plans with NetEase to bring Diablo III to Mainland China.","Rounding out our game update for this call is Heroes of the Storm, our upcoming hero brawler. Alpha testing continued in Q2 and was expanded to include players from other regions around the world. We're incredibly excited about the prospects for Heroes of the Storm. As we head back into the back half of 2014, we're looking to close out the year strong with BlizzCon and the release of Warlords of Draenor, in addition to the ongoing content that we're in the process of adding to Hearthstone, Diablo III and Heroes of the Storm.","We're proud to be offering more gaming options that appeal to a wide range of players across more platforms than ever before.","Thanks. And I'll turn the call back over to Kristin.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Thanks, Mike. And I think, we'll open up the call for questions now. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Looks like you're guiding 3Q above the Street. And what can you tell us about Destiny preorders and anything you could tell us about the units there? And then, as you think about as the unit sale gets sold in this quarter, what does that mean for the digital opportunity as you look forward?","Eric Hirshberg","Sure. This is Eric, I'll take those in order. Well, first of all, as I mentioned in our prepared comments, Destiny preorders are on track to be the largest ever for new IP in the industry. But it's important to note that preorders are just one data point that we look at when determining the momentum of a franchise like this. We also look at our quantitative studies surrounding things like purchase intent and awareness and we're seeing strength in those areas as well. It's also important to just sort of reset expectations as it relates to preorders overall. You guys can see the same thing we see industry-wide, that there's been sort of a secular downturn as it relates to preorders. We think that's happening due to a number of factors, things like increased digital consumption, particularly on the next-gen consoles, titles being widely available on day 1 and the decline overall for demand on previous-gen consoles. So given that trend, even more important to us is that preorders are the quantitative metrics that I mentioned, so I'll just share a few highlights from those. Destiny's awareness is at an all-time high and climbing when compared to any other new game intellectual property this distance from launch. Purchase intent is similarly at an all-time high and rising when compared to any other new IP, and we had 4.6 million players in the beta with almost universally positive sentiment. So all of those add to our sense of momentum for the launch. Overall, we're really pleased with the performance of the Destiny beta. We're pleased with the broad range of metrics that we look at to gauge momentum and our chances for success. As for your second question about digital, obviously, our strategy here is to build as large an installed base as possible so a big launch is key to that and getting momentum early is key to that. We have a robust plan for follow-on digital content to provide to our players, which we think will be highly relevant. And we've already announced 2 expansions that are coming.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Quick question on Hearthstone. Can you give us an idea for the type of engagement you're seeing out of the Naxx expansion? And longer term, any commentary on your belief in having a really new long-term revenue stream? Finally, just a quick question on Call of Duty. Any sense on how preorders are progressing at this point, especially relative to previous years?","Michael Morhaime","So we're very pleased with the engagement that we've seen out of Naxxramas, and I think that it really bodes very well for the engagement that we'll be able to drive in the future with additional content for the game. And so, I think, we'll learn more as time goes on, but the fact that last week was our strongest week ever for Hearthstone in terms of both revenue and engagement, I think, is a really strong sign. It's important to note that we still have yet to bring the game to the Android and iPhone devices. And if you look at the response we got from bringing Hearthstone to the iPad, which brought in millions of new accounts on Battle.net, I think, there's a lot of engagement and opportunity around those platforms as well.","Eric Hirshberg","On Call of Duty preorders, my answer will be fairly similar to what I said on Destiny in that you see the secular downturn across the industry as it relates to preorders, and Call of Duty is not immune to that. However, within that context, we still expect the Call of Duty to lead the industry in preorders once again this year. And also, like with Destiny, we also look at other metrics as well and we're seeing a lot of strength in those metrics, particularly, we have an internal quantitative consumer study and we're seeing purchase intent for Advanced Warfare to be significantly above that which we saw in Ghost, and actually in line with our past top-performing titles. And I think, it's also important to remember that we're still a ways from our launch and we have yet to reveal some of the most important elements of the game to the community who tends to like multiplayer and some of our best preorders are yet to come.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Daniel Ernst of Hudson Square.","Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.","Kind of a 2-part question, if I might, on Destiny. Clearly, the beta went well and it looked great at E3, and as you said, the intent for it is quite high and it sounds like you're seeing a similar thing for Call of Duty. So I was wondering if you could, big picture, discuss how much demand is there for big games like that, given that they play all year round. When you have 2 of those big tent poles, but industry-wide, how many games like Destiny and Call of Duty can the industry demand support throughout the year? And then, sort of the second part of that question on Destiny, you previously discussed being a little bit concerned about the early profitability of the game. Obviously, a lot of development cost borne this year for a multiyear game, you have to do it on 4 consoles, obviously a big marketing portion. I wonder if you could talk some about what you're seeing on profitability for Destiny now, what your thoughts are for now and a little bit in the future as you no longer have to support 4 consoles and you've pushed past the launch cost.","Eric Hirshberg","I'll take the first part and I'll let Dennis speak to the profitability question. On how many games the industry can support, and particularly the first-person action genre, I think, we've seen in the past that the first-person action genre in particular is broadly appealing to accommodate more than one blockbuster hit. There have been other good performing players in that genre and that hasn't ever kept Call of Duty from delivering incredible results. So we think that there's room for more than one blockbuster hit and we're just intent on having 2 of them. That said, we do think that the games are very different from one another. Call of Duty, as you know, is a gritty, authentic military shooter, and Destiny is a far future sci-fi action-adventure game with lot of RPG characteristics. So in fact, when you look at the people who participated in the Destiny beta, we actually think Destiny has the capability to appeal not only to the first-person action fan, but also to bring new fans into our portfolio since the game also appeals to fans of RPG and action-adventure games. So net-net, the answer is that we believe industry can and will support both, and I think, history has shown that whenever publishers have shown up with breakthrough great content with great experiences for fans, that those have tend to find a market. Dennis?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. And then, just relating to the Destiny kind of profitability point, Dan, and you know, we don't provide franchise-level details on profitability, but obviously, the biggest driver of profitability is the scale of the franchise, and we expect both to achieve high scale and deliver substantial profitability from our investment over time. That's based on Bungie's track record as a marquee developer, having developed Halo on a single platform and selling more than 50 million units lifetime and billions in sales. So that track record and the ability to bring the franchise cost platform represents a very big profit opportunity for the company. Relating to our guidance though, our guidance does assume that Destiny will be marginally profitable this year, given the significant marketing investments for launch, as well as the amortization of development expenses to build the game and the game engine and tools. And long-term, obviously, we think that's going to be a profitable franchise and foundation for us to build off of.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on Call of Duty Online. Looks like you're getting close to closed beta. Just curious, any feedback you may have gotten from the alpha testing and getting in some optimism for the beta launch here shortly? And then, obviously, China is a competitive for first-person shooters, and I guess, in particular, CrossFire, fairly entrenched. Just wondering how you'd best position that game to the market there for success?","Eric Hirshberg","Sure. As I mentioned in my comments earlier, development is going very well and it's actually gaining some momentum. We have, as you know, I think, some of our best development talent working on this opportunity, both from our core Call of Duty studios in the West, as well as our best-in-class back end technology gurus at DemonWare and our team in Shanghai. We also have, I think, the best partner in the market with Tencent, who has built with us a detailed development rollout plan that we're now in the midst of executing. So the indicators so far are really positive across numerous player engagement and tracking metrics that both we and they are using and seeing as positive. So we're entering the large scale close beta testing now. There'll be hundreds of thousands of Chinese gamers playing soon and so we'll know more after that. As far as breaking through the marketplace with an entrenched competitor, we think that our best efforts are making a breakthrough game that will be something that the market hasn't seen that level of quality before. And making sure that we take the time to get it right and to build something that's going to be sticky and is built for the long term. We think that we have that in motion, and if we do, obviously, the market is a huge market and a huge opportunity for us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Ju of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Eric or Dennis, some of your competitors have seen 12% to 15% of new release sales coming from full game digital downloads. Is this pretty consistent with what you've been seeing or should we be thinking about it differently? And further, what is your expectation for the mix of Destiny full game downloads?","Dennis Durkin","Sure. Thanks, Stephen. Dennis here. Yes, obviously, increasing digital downloads on consoles have been very positive margin-accretive tailwind for our industry and one that we expect to benefit from for the foreseeable future. But while day and day frontline digital distribution has only recently come to consoles with the launch of the next-gen systems last fall, we have a unique position of having seen the progression of digital sales with Blizzard products over the last decade, selling directly to consumers via Battle.net. And over that period, today, we now see the vast majority of Blizzard sales are digital. So we know that's a trend that's likely to be followed over the long term in the console space. Last fall, as you point out, digital mix was, on frontline, was in the single-digits as a percentage of our sales mix. And in the first half of this year, we have seen with some of the smaller launches and in catalog titles, that mix climbed into the teens as a percentage of revenue mix. Keep in mind though, when you fast-forward into the fall and into this holiday, our titles are some of the biggest in the industry and attracts some of the broadest audiences. So are likely to have smaller percentages, I'd say, of the total revenue mix, although over time as I said, based on the Blizzard experience, we expect that to continue to trend upward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird & Co.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","One follow-up on Destiny. Eric, is there any more takeaways from the beta, for instance, what sort of tweaks are you making to the game from the user feedback? And were you satisfied with the nuts and bolts of the performance around server stability? And then, a quick one for Mike on Warlord, should we assume the uptick in users around that release will be weighted towards the western markets, and thus, be more favorable in terms monetization or would it be more balanced between East and west?","Eric Hirshberg","On the Destiny beta, thanks for the question, on a while, it was certainly a very successful beta, both creatively and technologically. It was the biggest beta of this generation of consoles and the biggest beta ever for a new IP, so we were able to test everything at scale and everything held up well. I don't think it's an overstatement to say that feedback was nearly universally positive. That said, as you might imagine, we learned a lot by watching players engage with the game and hearing their feedback and Bungie is now making tweaks to optimize the game and they actually did so after the alpha as well, so that's going to be, I think, an ongoing process to make it a better experience and nothing is more important to us or to Bungie than delivering a great experience to our community and the beta certainly helped us do that. But I would describe these as tweaks and not major changes as we saw the fundamentals of the game to be very strong. And the good news is because we've got 4.6 million players into the beta, we were able to test the back end at scale and the system performed really well and stably. And we think we're ready for a great launch with a great partner in Bungie.","Michael Morhaime","Colin, thanks for the World of Warcraft question. We would expect World of Warcraft subscribership to bounce back, both in the East and the West. I don't have a prediction on the ratio of that but it's important to note that when you look at the prepurchase of Warlords, that 1.5 million is all in the West. I think, it's also important to note that if you look at the overall sort of health and size of Blizzard's Battle.net community, we're up 40% year-over-year just looking at monthly actives at the end of Q2. So we have a healthy community. I think, the community is ready for new content, and so far, into the beta of Warlords, the feedback has been very positive.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Turning out to be a big year for Blizzard, and I was just wondering if you could talk about the potential for Heroes of the Storm, and any indication of a more specific timing, and just in general, how we should think about how big of a title this could be? And then, separately, on Call of Duty, to what you attribute the increase in active player count for Call of Duty during this seasonally slower time? And as you said, kind of contradicting the normal Q2 decline, is it a function of interest in the game from those that are purchasing next-gen hardware or do you think it's something else?","Michael Morhaime","So it's still too early to make any kind of projections in terms of the size of the opportunity. We think we have a very strong game and we know that the genre is very large and continues to grow. We think that our spin on the genre is unique and combined with Blizzard's recognizable characters, our design philosophy, which is really trying to create a very approachable team-based game, kind of sets us a little bit apart from some of the competition. We're encouraged by the fact that millions have signed up to test the game and we'll have additional information about timing later in the year.","Eric Hirshberg","On Call of Duty, I think, all we can attribute it to is a strong interest in the franchise and strong activity and strong as ever Call of Duty content. Because of the console transition, we probably have more players engaged in 2 titles at once right now with both Ghost and Black Ops II for those who haven't made the transition yet, so that could be a contributor. But mostly, we just see lot of anticipation for Advanced Warfare, which could lead to increased playtime as well and a strong healthy desire for Call of Duty content to set the stage well for our launch with Advanced Warfare. And we think that, in general, the Call of Duty delivers the best online gaming experience and we're doing so currently and we'll certainly aim to continue to do so with Advanced Warfare.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Neil Doshi of CRT Capital.","Neil A. Doshi - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Do you think we could see Activision create an online subscription plan where players can access older catalog titles and get early access to new titles? And then, on the Hearthstone game itself, I think, in the past, you guys have said that it was on track to exceed $100 million in revenue. As you launched the iPad and then consider that the broader market with iPhone and Android yet to come, how should we think about that overall number?","Eric Hirshberg","I'll take your first question. This is Eric. As you know, we have a very focused strategy as a company and we tend to focus our resources and our people on the biggest and best creative and commercial opportunities. And right now, I think, we have our strongest slate ever and we're broadening that slate. So we have a lot of focus on and do not make sure we get right in the coming months to keep our temple franchises driving and establishing new ones as well. And we think everything will work and has huge potential. So of course, we're always looking at new opportunities to better serve our players and our communities and we're always evaluating new business models. And once those models are proven, we'll pursue them if we think it makes sense for our players and for our business. But right now, we're continuing to focus on the things we discussed on our call, which include a wide range of business and monetization models and all of which will deliver, we think, the best experience for our fans and a great return for our shareholders.","Michael Morhaime","And on the Hearthstone question, Hearthstone has been exceeding all of our expectations. We're not ready to provide a new specific number but we're very excited about the long-term prospects, especially when you consider further platform expansion to smartphones and a strong multiyear content pipeline that we have planned.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Arvind Bhatia of Stern Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","As Eric just mentioned, you guys have a fantastic lineup this year, Diablo III, Destiny, Hearthstone, World of Warcraft expansion pack, one might wonder if this sets up a high watermark for you guys that might be difficult to surpass? Hypothetically, I'm wondering if you can maybe discuss some longer-term trends for you guys, the growth potential of your portfolio beyond 2014.","Robert A. Kotick","Sure Arvind, great question. We obviously have spent a lot of time investing against not just this year but for the next few years and I think we have a great roadmap for opportunity. I think, you know we're very good at prioritizing those opportunities. And I think, among the things that we're the most excited about are the opportunities for new geographies that are getting the benefit of more sophisticated technology like smartphones. When you think about the population of smartphones in places like China, that would be something like 500 million smartphones sold between now and 2020 in China. And when you look at geographies in the past that have been inaccessible to us as a company, whether it's Eastern Europe or Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, these are all market opportunities that we're seeing for the first time. I think, when you look at the opportunities for us to provide new services, things like virtual item sales, you look at the changing business models, like we've adopted with games like Hearthstone, we see over the next 3 to 5 years the opportunity to serve greater audiences with deeper, richer experiences. And the pathways that we have for the franchises that we've invested in over a very long time, we spent a lot of time and a lot of resources planning against future opportunities. And so, I think, we feel very good about not just what we have for this year and next year but over the next 5 to 10 years, we see lots of opportunities that have never been available to the company before.","Kristin Mulvihill Southey","Okay. Well, I want to thank you, all, and everyone at Activision Blizzard for your time and consideration and we look forward to talking to you soon.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."]}}
